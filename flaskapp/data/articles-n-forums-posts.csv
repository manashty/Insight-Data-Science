My youngest is neurotypical and shows no signs of autism.

        Its possible that your child may have Asperger's because it's biological uncle has it, but at the same time Asperger's could be a random gene mutation. Asperger's is interesting like that and could be misdiagnosed as ADHD. When my dad learned from my mom after getting an evaluation, that I had mild Asperger's as well as mild ADHD, my dad finally understood why I didn't learn well from him, he said that I had to have gotten the Asperger's from him, blaming himself, but it may not have been inherited. I have mild Asperger's because I had a mother who was willing to help me, and according to a Psychologist, I'm one of the few lucky ones who have kind of 'outgrown' it, thanks to my mother. But as I said, Asperger's is either inherited or just plain random in gene mutation I think. So don't worry about it too much. Everything will be OK I'm sure. Good luck with your baby! ;)

        I try to read books with him but he is only interested for a short while before he wants to move on to something else. Same with movies/tv.

He plays with us by chasing, wrestling, tickling, and hand clap games. He likes to play catch and basket ball.

He does try to get our attention with his activity.  

 

A lot of times he brings us things like a toy car or some other object and gives it to us while ''talking''. I don't know what he wants us to do with it  usually because I have no idea what he is trying to say unless it's something obvious like a ball. He often wants to share his food with us. He takes his spoon or whaever it is he is eating and holds it to our mouths going ''ahhh'' (open). Sometimes he will go  and get food when he isn't even eating and tries to feed us, not wanting to eat himself I don't know why he does that .If we accept his offer he goes ''Mmmmm yum''

When he does something he is proud of he  looks at us and claps his hands going ''yaaay!''. If we do something he likes ( like making a basket while plaing basketball) he will either cap and say yay or gives us a high five. Mostly he just claps, though.

Are these  joint attention?


The thing is he is very hyperactive. He cannot sit still. He is constantly on the go. Running, jumping playing very loudly. He babbles to himself very loudly and is always squealing and laughing loudly while doing this. He likes to run a lot. Sometimes he will run back and forth through the living room and wont stop until he is asked to or he is out of breath. This is the only repetitive behavior he has.

He also likes to climb things. The stairs, furniture, etc. Once he used a crutch leaning against a bookshelf as a ladder to get some candy I put on the top. If he wants it he'll find a way to climb if I won't give it to him.  I have read this is a symptom...

 

 

I don't know how he is socially. His social interaction with others has been extremely limited. He doesn't know anyone his age. Except for a cousin he has been around a couple of times, he has never been around another child. He did seem to take an interest his cousin though.  He doesn't meet strangers often. I think when he had his preschool eval a few weeks ago, that was his first time meeting someone new in many many months. Or actually, seeing anyone besides me, my So and my farther in months. My S.O and I mostly keep to ourselves.  He is shy and I am also shy. It is aso hard for me to find friends because I  can't relate to most people my age ( 24 ) but  I can't relate to older mothers, either. This has led me to be very isolated and after being isolated for so long I am finding it very difficult to go out and make new friends... I am wondering if this might be aprt of our son's problem.

anyway, i do therapy with autistic children and have witnessed some of what you are describing. we call your child's poop playing ""fecal smearing"", and is something that is not exceptionally uncommon for some autistic children to exhibit. without seeing your child it isn't easy to say one way or the other, but if you are concerned i would encourage you to ask the child's pediatrician about the behaviors and see if they can recommend someone for you to talk to (psychologist/ psychiatrist) who would be able to give your child an evaluation. if your child does lie somewhere on the autism spectrum early intervention seems to help the child be successful. hope this helps.

        That's one of the things that throws us for a loop. He's not hyper-social (his sister is), but he seems fairly normal interacting with other kids. He does tend to do small-group or individual activities on the playground at school, but has a few good friends he's made and will play with them for a long time when he's with them (1st grade, btw).

He's well-liked by teachers and other other parents. Very well-behaved. Top grades, but not crazy-genius smart. Just works hard on his homework. Once he sets his mind to something, he gets good at it. Does crave order and routine - he gets more awkward the more he's in unfamiliar territory. Very cautious kid. Has color-blindness in case this is relevant. 

What kind of therapy is available? What is typical long-term prognosis? Many thanks!

        Hi! My little boy was diagnosed with autism at two and a half. He is and has always been Very loving and affectionate. He has very good eye contact when it comes to things he enjoys or wants. He definitely noticed when we leave the room, in fact at times, he cries. He has no aggression and never tantrums. At 2, he had several 2 word phrases, he could count to 20 and cite his ABC's but there were a few things about him that were very unusual. Here is a list: 

- he did not point with his index finger 
- he did not shake his head no or nod yes
- he could label every number and letter, but he could not answer yes or no questions 
- he memorized books word for word and could recite them when he saw them
- he had no pretend play 
- he seldom responded to his name 
- he communicated only to make his needs met, he never communicated to chat or share
- he lined up his toys and loved to examine objects up close
- if it came to choosing between a colourful teddy and a cellphone, he chose the cellphone. 
- he flapped his arms when he was excited. 
- he couldn't follow instruction, not even ""bring to mommy""
- there were times, I would talk to him and it was like he was deaf and couldn't hear. 

Autism can be diagnosed as early as 18 months and it is usually easily diagnosed at 2. If he does have similar symptoms as my guy, I would definitely get him checked if possible. And if you google ""Floor Time"" therapy, that's a really good technique you can use to help him while you are waiting for diagnosis. I had to wait several months for my sons assessment and by the time we went, just by using that technique for a few hours a day, he'd greatly improved.

        His latest developmental pediatrician diagnosed him with ADHD last year, however, thinking he was not on the spectrum. She wanted to rule out seizures first, and so we had a 3-day ambulatory EEG, which was totally negative.
 
His regular pediatricians have gotten blood work for glucose levels and whatnot, and everything seems to come out fine.
 
Also, I have always been curious if these episodes (but on a lesser level throughout the day) have anything to do with what might look like ADHD? Could it all be related somehow? BTW, he is not on any medication. He does take omega-3 and evening primrose (omega-6). 

What are some examples of those other explanations? My husband and I feel like we keep hitting a brick wall. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

     I started to notice he struggled to retain information eg recognising letters/numbers, he has poor pencil grip, his handwriting is awful and he struggles with fine motor skills.he can not ride a bike and struggles with ball skills.he is not very interested in physical activities and prefers to be in his own company or on a one to one basis with adults although he does mix with peers.he finds making friends difficult and can ramble on about a subject of intrest for long periods or time.he doesn't consider people's unwillingness to be in a conversation,their opinions or emotions and will often interrupt people already engaged in a conversation or activity.he is diagnosed with hyper mobility and dyslexia. 
    I raised concerns but was told it was early days and he would soon pick up.his memory is fantastic and he absorbs all information like a sponge especially with subjects that intrest him.maths, science and computers really are his strong points.his ability exceeds those of his peers but he is not meeting that ability on paper!he also gets confused with remembering more than one verbal instruction at a time.he has a very wide vocab but does use language very literally. 
     my middle son is 4 and has just started full time school.he was also born at term and developed really well with no indicators of any problems.he was a very alert baby and has never needed a lot of sleep to be full of beans.his physical development has always matched development milestones but his speech and language is delayed and he is having therapy for this without much real improvement.i started to be concerned by his speech and language and understanding around 12-18 months of age. 
     my son is always active from swinging his legs or playing with his fingers while sitting to jumping up and down to running in circles.he is impulsive, has a short attention span, poor appertite, restless sleep with regular waking, constant tossing and turning while asleep and has issues with not having my attention constantly.he can be destructive, desruptive, has a very short fuse and has a fiery temper.he can have violent tempers which I can't always explain.he will hurt himself and others and almost seems to gain release/pleasure from doing so.he also has issues with leaving me, does not like strangers to come into our home, can need a lot of physical contact (kisses and hugs) and verbal reassurance ( I'm your big boy arnt I? and love you are two things you hear from him very often) but is selective about times he will allow in one within his physical space. he likes to stick to routines at bedtime etc, likes to be told the next 2/3 things we are going to do,follow the same routes to school etc and can get adgetated / upset or angry if this doesn't happen.he likes to feel in control of his surroundings and people in them at all times.he always has bits of plastic, toys etc in his mouth and likes to carry small toys that fit in the palm of his hand especially when he's feeling anxiety.he shows very little if any awareness of danger or consequences. 
    school is a different matter though.he almost regresses into himself, doesn't mix with peers very well, prefers adult company, soils himself 2-3 times a week, is very tactile with adults ( needs to be hugged or touching a piece of their clothing) , is finding learning to read, write and recognise/ memorise letters/ numbers etc difficult.he displays no aggressive or disruptive behaviours at all!other than his speech and language delay the school do not see that he has problems. 
    my youngest son is 2 and was born at term with no complications.he has asthma but is otherwise healthy.he quite early on displayed signs of delays in physical development, understanding of language and intended use of toys etc and speech and language.he functions at approx 6-12 months behind in all areas.at 15 months his speech and social skills totally vanished!we are almost back to the point we were at then. 
     he has an abnormally high pain tolerance, aggressive outbursts towards himself others and physical objects when tired, scared, angry or frustrated.he never seems to feel full and will constantly eat if allowed to.he is very selective about what foods he will eat.he doesn't like the feel of grass,sand or anything slimy or sticky.he also puts small unedible objects in his mouth a lot. 
    he does not mix with children very well and does not like to be in unfamiliar surroundings or around unfamiliar people and will avert eye contact with people he doesn't know or is unsure of.he can get can get really upset/angry in this situation.he can play along side but not actually with other children.on times in his own world absorbed in a repetitive activity.he can also be extremely possessive of certain toys and belongings. he makes grunting noises as a means of communication and screams a lot. if you ask him a question he mostly just repeats it back to you or if it has options he just says the last one.if you ask him the same question straight after but swap the options around he will again repeat the last one which could be totally different! 
he has recognised delays and receives support through play therapies and is awaiting speech and language therapy. 

    I'm at my wits end and do not know where to turn for help!are my sons conditions connected and what could cause these problems?please help me!!??could they all have a type of autism?

        None of those signs are any more than signs, it won't give an autism diagnosis. If your son doesn't have problems with social relationships and language (either in development or in use), autism isn't a right diagnosis. 

Normal kids may also flap with hands and have ambidexterity without it being pathological so, as well as autistic may have neither of them and still being autistic.

Still wet at night about half of the time.  Had a very tough time when little sis joined the family around a year and a half ago.

        It would be helpful to know what country you are posting from.
In the UK there are three types of state school: mainstream, mixed (mainstream and special needs); and special needs.  Then there are independent and private schools.
You would be best advised to speak with a national organisation for Downs Syndrome and Autism in your country to find out what the educational rights of your child are.  You could also get advise from a solicitor who specialises in special needs educational law.
Having said that, you need a school that has experience and expertise in the conditions your child has.  I tried to keep my son (with autism) in a mainstream only school for over 3 years waiting for them to train up and understand his needs.  It didn't work because they just weren't interested.  It was three years of him losing skills, becoming anti-school and my general and mental health deteriorating because of the school's lack of even the most basic understanding of how to meet the needs of a child on the autistic spectrum.  And my son is high functioning autistic!
He now goes to an Enhanced School which is a mixture of mainstream children and special needs in each class.  All the staff have training and experience of autism, and it works.  And I know definately at that school there are children with autism who are still in diapers and who are in mainstream class.
If the school is being so negative about your child then that might not be the right environment for your child.  And although you may have the 'law' on your side and could fight to keep him there and for them to meet his needs, are they really experienced enough to know how to educate him?  In my experience the answer is usually no.
You would be better advised to focus on finding a school that has the best facilities and experience to meet his needs so that he makes better progress.

        While in retrospect, many children with Asperger's had some signs when they were pre-schoolers, it's generally too early to give them a diagnosis of Asperger's at that age....that doesn't stop some clinicians from doing so but I feel it's inappropriate because most children lag in one thing or another, and for some children they are just going to lag a little socially, but usually catch up but first grade.

In children with Asperger's, however, you usually really see them start to diverge socially from their peers by first grade, and things like hypersensitivity might become apparent or more pronounced.

        While in retrospect, many children with Asperger's had some signs when they were pre-schoolers, it's generally too early to give them a diagnosis of Asperger's at that age....that doesn't stop some clinicians from doing so but I feel it's inappropriate because most children lag in one thing"

I understand how difficult it can be for parents that have troubled children, To me I would say it could be a range of possible things like ADHD (Attention Defisit Disorder) but personally from what you have described could be a form of autism (ASD - Aspergers Syndrome/Autisic Spectrum Disorder) but the doctor will know alot more than me about this.

But I hope you manage to control his behaivior but just remember although the child wont know any differant it may affect his life in the future as I have ASD and your emotions are horrible to cope with.

All I can say is good luck with the doctors.

        Thank you. I did not realize this forum was staffed by PhD's. Since I cannot remove the post I will post what we have learned for future parents should they search the forum for something similar.  

It was suspected by his doctors that his episodes were seizure related, but after hospitalization and EEG/Video monitoring, no seizures were found. It is believed to be that the has a a periodic paralysis disorder. Which is unrelated to his Autism Spectrum Disorder. I did find articles on PubMed that verify his symptoms are related to his myotonic muscle disorder. Anyone out there whose child might appear to have symptoms like this that has seen many doctors like we have and has a clean EEG, consider visiting www.ppa.org for information about paralytic disorders.
Best Wishes!

        I have high functioning autism and have younger siblings that suffer (if that's an acceptable word) from the disorder. I believe  that the chewing is a calming tool to do with sensory issues from the child to the cloths, with mild OCD tendencies  which is common to people with ASD among with other conditions. But on how to stop it there are several methods you could try such as-

avoidance; to remove the clothing that frays such as cotton to denim or wool to nylon. 
replacement; to replace the chewing of one thing to another more acceptable source
ignoring; to just ignore and let them stop on their own accordance due to peer pressure and such.
and finally in stages; first stop the chewing by asking for it when you see them chewing but let them pull the string then once that is under control stop them at the pulling stage mentioning how by pulling the string they cost money which you could spend on fun things if they did not ruin their cloths.

i hope this was helpfull  .

        Have you considered having him diagnosed? Our aspie child needed therapy to help work on the issues you mention. They do blame other people for things, they make odd noises, fidget, don't make friends, and will be picked on in school if the proper things aren't in place to help them. 
In fact we took my son out of public school and home schooled him for two years while we worked on social skills therapy, and getting a proper diagnosis. Now he will be going back to school but with the proper therapy and supports in place.
Asperger child do not mean to sound rude, they just speak matter of fact all the time. They are not capable of putting themselves in your shoes to realize how a comment might affect someone else. If something is, then it just is to them.

I would consider seeing a psychologist or developmental pediatrician who might be able to help you determine if he has Asperger's.  Once we did that....things improved because we were able to obtain the resources to teach my son how to have a conversation without interrupting. And that he can't always blurt out what he's thinking. Etc...certainly not easy of course, but at least you'd have some insight into why he's this way.

        I (the father of the child in this matter) would like to add a couple of things, which might clarify our daughter's bahaviour.

The things that concern us the most is that she is not capable of following instructions when she (for whatever motive) does not feel like following them:
- She throws herself on the street while crossing just because she didn't get the toy she wanted. One can forget any kind of reasoning in those situations.
- When she likes something (like my wife said earlier) she has to repeat that all day long for days on end (sometimes weeks even). It does not seem like a 'compulsive' thing though, it is more obsessive than anything else.
- She barely sits still. As in that she will sit at the table to eat, takes two bites and just walks away. If it doesn't interest her somehow, she just walks away and starts doing her own thing.
- It is very hard for her to follow any kind of routine other than what she adapted herself.

Putting this all together, we are concerned about the fact that in about a year she will have to go to school. The way we know her, we don't see her capable of following the regime of a school, where she actually has to follow instructions of an authority.
She likes to do thing that challenge her intellectually, but it has to be her pick, in the way she wants to. If not, she either just walks away, or if we insist she throws a tantrum.

Now, what we are tying to figure out is whether we might have to have her checked for a potential disorder (whichever that might be) or whether she is just a bit of a spoiled brat. ;-)
Not that the disorder scenario would be a big deal, but it would allow us to better understand 'her world' and guide her appropriately.

Our concern is really only as far as it concerns her best interest. So we want to make sure that she gets the right kind of attention and treatment that helps her develop in the best way that we can offer her.

        Your post caught my attention, as I have a 6 y.o. child diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and I am well familiar with the warning signals. The behaviors you describe are very familiar and concerning. We experienced those same behaviors and more at that age. I would definitely seek the help of a professional, but please beware of pediatricians! Unfortunately, a lot of pediatricians are not trained to identify autism, especially where they use a basic developmental screening test that does not necessarily raise flags for autism. I was told by three different pediatricians that my child's developmental delays and weird behaviors were 'normal' and not of concern. I believe they may have been eluded by my son's great eye contact and outgoing nature. I'm sure you understand that the earlier you catch it the better your chances for successful intervention. Since your son is under 3 you will qualify for services provided by the state. Please, seek the help of a professional who has extensive experience with autism specifically!! And hang in there, things are going to be challenging and exhausting (I'm sure they already are), but you are asking the right questions now and that's going to help you so much. 

Good luck with your journey! My heart goes out to you...

        Dear Dr. Graff,
My 6 years old nephew was diagnosed with autism.
His mother gives him numerious supplements ( 17 all together ) a day and firmly believes that by doing it she could cure him.
This child attends a special kindegarten for autistic children for the last two years and once a week he attends a developemental centre for children with Dawn syndrome.
This child could speak some words and understand meaning of commands but has no speech as such.
He could tell what is on the picture ( eg. house, car ) when we show it to him, could say: red ball, go, up, could count from 1 to 10.
He eats the same food every day since he was 2 years old and refuses to try something new.  My sister sit him in a high chair to eat and do not let him go untill he finishes foot.  It takes up to 1-2hours.
When in kindergarten he sits with other kids around normal table.
This boy is hyperactive at times and seems not interested in adults or chldren.  Yet, he plays with me, asking me to hug me and to kiss me and is doing a lot of physical movements ( like crawling towards my legs when I am sitting ), jumping from my lap ( etc ).
Questions: do you belive that numerious supplements could cure such child?
Do you agree with his mother to fit him in high chair for 1-2 hours daily when he is at home?
Do you think it is wise to take him to the developement centre with children suffering with Dawn syndrome?
My sister said he has high IQ ( she didn't tell the score ).
Do you belive that a child, who is almost not verbal could have high IQ?
Sorry for the long list of questions.
I would really appreciate your answers.

2. feeling own the borders of own body

Try to imagine, that social rules are not self explaining for autistics. From autistic view, they are mostly absurd, ineffective and have to be learned with high cognitive efforts - and tolerating the irritation or cognitive dissonance to adapt those (absurd) behaviours.
So separating between inner motivation and outer requirements...

The humanoid system of sexual arousal is implemented basically before puberty, from (not later than) birth. There is no ejaculation before puberty, but the relaxing phasis at the end of orgasm can felt.
To avoid stimulation (looking) in public, it's necessary to avoid stressors (unknown situations/people/locations, crowds, people watching the kid directly) and focussing on well known objects (maybe a thing, which the kid is carrying whole time or things with simple geometrics and colour e.g. cube from plastics). In summary, try to substitute self stimulation.

Referring to Temple Grandin, maybe pressure to the body (e.g. if possible heavy jacket/vest or braces (suspenders? those old fashioned things to keep trousers up)) can help the kid to sense its corporal borders.

        Dear Dr. Graff,

I do not have the energy for a visceral response to what you wrote, but I can begin by telling you that I think Ms. Harrison answered you very well and I understand the anger Tsilla1777 feels about your comments and observations.

It tends to anger me that ever since Dr. Wakefield's study has been debunked, and incidentally, it was debunked not because its conclusions were wrong but because its methodology was unsound and scientifically invalid, ""concerned"" doctors and other health care professionals cannot wait for the opportunity to write columns on how stupid and gullible parents have been and continue to be.  But, before it was debunked, the vast majority of that same population refused to spend five minutes seriously considering that vaccines might be a problem.  Right there, that's a credibility problem, and it gives rise to a willingness on the part of parents to believe in what you dismiss as conspiracy theories.  If you bring a confirmation bias to the consideration of the question, your conclusions cannot be valid.

I agree with Ms. Harrison...I too saw the moment when my child went from a normal, healthy baby to a child who stared into space and did not respond to her name.  My child is 11-years-old now and the exact age she was is cloudy to me, but she was 1 1/2 to 2 years old.  She received several vaccines in one day and it is therefore impossible to know which vaccine caused the problem.  The same thing happened to her younger sister a few years later when we were STILL not believing fully what our own senses were showing us precisely because of the arrogant, self-serving opinions of doctors on the subject of vaccines.  No intelligent person wants to be classified as a villager with a pitchfork, and we certainly do not want to fight with our pediatricians, which I have had to do any number of times, or be classified as bad parents.  So, we partially ignored what we know, to the detriment of our children.  But I will say this.  Whereas with my elder child, I let the doctor convince me to continue to vaccinate albeit ""more slowly,"" with my older child, when it happened to my younger child, I stopped.  Today, I have one child who is autistic and one who is not.  The one who is not received fewer vaccines even before the day when she seemed to react as her sister did, which I believe explains why that reactive incident knocked one into autism and the other not.

My husband had a co-worker who simply could not understand why we do not vaccinate our children, until her son wound up in the hospital and almost died from a blood infection related to his DTaP vaccine.  Then she said to my husband, ""I understand now why you don't vaccinate your kids.  I'll never do it again.""  Did you hear me say that it was DTaP that almost caused the death of that child, not the MMR vaccine?

The truth of the matter is that the worst thing Dr. Wakefield did was to create the mother lode of all red herrings around the issue of vaccine safety.  Dr. Graff, the MMR vaccine is not the only problem.  

Are you listening?

The Thimerisal in the MMR vaccine (and others) is not the only problem, though it is a problem.  It is also a problem that my elder daughter's original pediatrician looked me in the face and promised me in 1999 that Thimerisal was not a problem because it had been removed.  It wasn't removed until 1999 and the vials already containing it were not discarded.  I was still seeing package inserts with Thimerisal years after the fact.

Are you listening?

Vaccines contain any number of impurities and additives, the vast majority of which a parent could be sent to prison for forcing their child to ingest.  It is unknown and has not been fully researched what effect these vaccines have in certain children over a period of time.

Did you hear me?

Would you hear HIM?:

 Incidentally, it's egotistical to say that nobody is going to believe you until you are invited on Oprah.  Do you honestly believe you are saying anything original?  Do you honestly believe we haven't been forced to listen to other people saying exactly what you do?  It is sadly entirely legitimate to see conspiracies around this subject.  The pharmaceutical industry makes huge amounts of money from vaccines.  Pediatricians lose about 90% of their practices without vaccines -- and that's a conservative estimate.  Physicians all too often rely entirely on the word of their pharmaceutical sales representatives to tell them what is in a medication and what it does.  Insurance companies? I have no idea how they make money.  They seem to pay out much more than they take in to me given how crazily expensive medical care is, but clearly there is some part of that equation I am not considering.  What I do know is that they pay for vaccines but refuse to pay for immune titers to either test for the need for a vaccine or test to see if a vaccine even worked after it was administered, so if there were ever to be a time when vaccines were ALLOWED to be proven to be dangerous, all of these groups would face staggering liability lawsuits.  You're lying to yourself and to us if you do not think that would motivate a group of people to want to debunk something before it got serious consideration.

Thank you for your time.

I have to say from your description it is very likely the things you describe are symptoms of it:
sensitivity to noise/taste
flapping
eye contact issues
poor social relations and emotional skills/control

- please note there are special schools that cater for such children if diagnosed with this.

All the best.

        Your son sounds a lot like mine.  He is going to be two next week and he does not have any words yet.  He used to say a few words when he was a year old, but lost that ability.  He also grunts a lot and hums.  He's also very happy and loves to laugh and play, and even seeks us out for ""chasing"" games, but otherwise he likes to run around the house (or down the sidewalk) and plays by himself.  He does not know how to play with a toy appropriately, rather, he spins wheels, takes pieces off of the puzzles (without ever putting them back on) and throws blocks around.  
He's been evaluated by early childhood development and they have placed him in a toddler autism characteristics group.  Their opinion was devastating to me, but I knew deep down that he needed their help.  What is most important is not the label (and I know that's tough to get over) but that he get the help he needs.  
Whether he's on the spectrum or not, it won't hurt him to get specialized help with speech, communication and eye contact.  At his age, it's provided by your state - and paid for by your taxes - so there's no reason not to look into it.  
Good luck!

        First off jlevin, i think that one of the issues that needs to be further explored is WHY he doesn't want to take his medicine, is it because he thinks he doesnt need it or something?  Another thing is the question of what is triggering these violent outbursts? is it stress, someone making a comment about something, etc.

I'm talking from personal experience here by the way.  Usually with me the problem usually starts out small, like say my Dad wants me to empty the dishwasher, and I say ""no, I don't want to, and nothing's preventing you from doing it""  from there the issue would escalate to something like my Dad cutting off the internet, or attempting to take away my laptop.  The problems then build on themselves from there.  

Asperger's Syndrome alone does not cause these issues.  It's more a misunderstanding that's placed there due to the disorder.  Basically meaning, that like in the example of my dad asking me to empty the dishwasher, I'll interpret it as him being lazy and trying to delegate all his jobs off to other people (when he really already does quite a lot).

Also in some cases of people with Asperger's, removing them from a familiar area/situation,  and putting them into a new unknown place can cause more problems than it solves.  

I understand that you want to help their family out jlevin, but it seems that the actual problem is a lot more deep seated than initially thought.  There seem to be a couple solutions to this issue.  The first issue that needs resolving is that their family needs to regain a sense of security and control again.  The parents need to be put back in control of the situation is basically what i'm saying.  So now that i've said that...I'm about 50/50 on this solution, basically that the next time an outburst occurs that they need to call the police.  Now here's why im debating whether this will help or not.  The problem is that since he's over 18, the police can charge him with assault or domestic abuse or both.  This most likely would land him in jail, which in my mind would probably only serve to make things worse as he'd probably think it was his family's fault he got sent there.  So instead of making things better, it would make things worse.  Although there's the chance that it could turn him around for the better, I don't know.

Secondly, I'd say that their family should talk to his psychiatrist ASAP and bring up the issue of the violence, and see what the psychiatrist says and reccomends to be done.

Third, I'd probably say that in order to get to the actual core problem, their family should possibly think about a therapist.  Talk therapy can be very helpful as it would most likely be a chance for him to tell his side of the story as well as hear what the other perspective is.  

Hope this helps

        raven, your son sounds just like a little boy in our church. His parents were frustrated over their child's pointing and non verbal ways, and of course, always comparing his behavior with other 3 year olds.  Their pediatrician referred him to a speech therapist and that was the best thing!  He has so improved in the communication department and is one of the most social and friendly 6 year olds I know.  It's like he was released from his prison.  

And as far as the school system suggesting autism, well, I will say that a non professional giving that kind of diagnosis possibility is out of line.  I work in Special Education in the school system and I can tell you now that saying such a thing to a parent could get someone in trouble and financially responsible for that child's care.  Whatever a school person might suggest, they had better have some resources to back up their claims!

You sound like you have a very normal child on your hands.  Put little one in speech therapy now!  By the time he gets to Kindergarten, he'll be caught up.

        The only way to know for sure if it's autism is to have him evaluated by a place that deals with development of children. I took my son to a CDRC-child development and rehabilitation center and they diagnosed him w/ autism. He didn't have all of the signs of autism either, because every autistic person is different and has different signs and symptoms. The best that you can do for your son is to find a place to evaluate him and then set up the supports to help him. He is the perfect age to start Early Intervention, they can help a lot with resources. Get him into a good special ed preschool if he is diagnosed, that has helped my son TREMENDOUSLY!!! Also we are filing for social security for him to help cover the costs of therapies-DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED IF HE HAS AUTISM, JUST GET CREATIVE!!!

        Sounds like my daughter who was diagnosed with pdd-now at age 3 and is now 6.  She didn't really talk until she was almost 4.  Some other symptoms were not responding to her name, she didn't really point to objects or pull us to go get things for her, she stared blankly at times.  She IS very affectionate and played with other children some.  The best advise I can give is to get her into ABA therapy and speech therapy asap.  
There are ways to get insurance to pay for these therapies even if you live in a state that doesn't require insurance companies to pay for therapy in Autism.
She's now talking, not like a normal 6yr old, she plays with other kids and is in a regular Kindergarten class.  If you were to just watch her you would think she is just really shy.  She has issues with aggression, depression, and gets over stimulated sometimes.  We have had to try some ADHD medications so she can stay focused in class.
I would also suggest reading some books on Autism.  Temple Grandin has written several.  
The last thing: PRAY.  We are not strong enough alone.  It takes a lot of patience and love for your little girl and yourself.  Always remember you are not alone.

I just wanted to tell you that you write very well.  The way you explained yourself, also shows that you pay alot of attention to detail and you are smart.  I am not sure how old you are now.  Given what I read, you should find what you like to do and makes you happy and focus on it.  Try to ignore all these lagels.  Labels will just drive you crazy.  Focus on what you do best. I can tell that you are good writer. Good luck.

        My son is 22 now and during his school years he was diagnosed with ADD. I had him on medication starting at 2nd grade but by 4th I realized he was digging deep holes in his head,much like a drug addict would do. I was horrified. I brought him into his doctor who lowered his dosage but I really started watching my son after that. I made the decision to take him off the meds as they did not seem to be working. I took him to a huge array of specialists and no one seemed to have a definitive answer. I heard he was OCD, ADD, developmentally delayed,learning disabled you name it, they labeled him. Finally I just gave up and home-schooled him. He had many characteristics of ADD (no hyperactivity) but something was off.He was (is) very smart he just has huge social delays. He didn't seem to relate at all to other kids. The older he got the worst it was. When he was 17 and in juvenile detention, almost 18 and ready to be transferred to adult jail I found my answer. On my own I was surfing the web and discovered a disability called Aspergers Syndrome. OMG!!! This was my son . To the T almost a perfect match. I spoke to the jail doctor and after some time I had my official diagnosis.As I mentioned he is 22 now and still lives with me. Your son can lead a normal life with Aspergers. My son has some other issues but I know if I put him in his own apartment and simply had someone help with his bills and day to day cleaning and such he'd be fine.I've heard it said if you see one kid with autism you've seen ....one kid with autism. The symptoms are all pretty much the same but the behaviors they display are as different as any other child. My son is very intelligent as are most Aspie kids,but he simply cannot understand how his actions affect others. He comes off as a complete jerk most often. If your boy has not been officially diagnosed you need to do that right away. There are lots of support groups for you and for him. I have to say it's much easier to help at an earlier age. The school should have picked up on it but as you can tell from my story not even doctors pick up on everything. Schools are very busy and kids get lost in the shuffle often. Props to your daughter for picking up on it. How old is she? I realize my post is a bit rambling but I thought it might help to see I've been through much the same thing. Does your son make friends? You mentioned bullying. Poor guy. Kids can be so mean. They sense a difference and go for blood. Again, check with your doctor. Push the issue. Bring up Aspergers yourself. Please Google Aspergers Symdrome. It will give you a complete lists of common symptoms. I was floored when I saw my son had 11 out of the 12 given. Please  stay in touch, I could use a friend in the same boat as me!!

        It seems your son is similar to me in some ways.  I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome when I was 11 and I'm also 21.  I only have 2 friends myself, not including internet friends.  And I've always had problems with projects, school/work related issues and working to achieve goals, etc.  I also have often wanted to wander off by myself when I don't feel like being around other people, even family  (so I spend most of my time in my bedroom).  And not being talkative is something I would have a problem with too.  Half the time, I make no attempt to hold a conversation with anyone, unless it's about something I'm interested in.  As for the paranoid delusions you mentioned, if it's something like hearing voices, that would be another issue that I could relate to.  But in all honesty, I wouldn't pin all your judgement on the opinion of one psychologist.  I've had one or two psychologists talk to me and they never understood me at all.  I would try and get a second opinion if I were you, maybe from a doctor who knows much more about Asperger's Syndrome, just to be sure.  If it turns out that your son does have Asperger's Syndrome, it's really nothing to worry about.  Although I myself never had any qualifications in school, I do some things that are good.  I've been able to read well since the age of 3 and write good poems and stories since I was 8.  My dream was to be an author, like Roald Dahl and JK Rowling, who are only some of my role-models.  It took a long time, but even without help or qualifications, I've had my very first children's book published and put online for sale in February 2010, which means I've achieved my dream.  Hopefully this will inspire others with Asperger's Syndrome to achieve their dreams and show them that it really is possible.  Anyway, good luck with you and your son and I hope you find all the answers you're looking for.  =o)

        My 4 year old son was diagnosed with pddnos which is on the Autism Spectrum... He also only loved playing with cars but he would do a lot of mimickink ( forgive my spelling) things he would hear on TV even though it was in the right timing. We were concerned because his speech seemed delayed but we could understand what he was trying to say. We had him evaluated by a group and we are here in Texas. It is called ECI- Early Child Intervention. He was then diagnosed and we started him in a program at our local elementary school and has been in it ever since. I am hoping that your kido does not have any of these issues but please know if he does there is help and my son has made huge improvements and the goal is for him to be integrated into a regular Kindergarten class and be out of special needs. Good Luck but I would get him checked out if you have any concerns!

        I was much the same from the age of 7, although I wasn't diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome until I was 11 (and it was my teacher who first noticed that I was different).  I've never liked noisy surroundings and crowded areas, which would either frustrate me or make me really nervous (making me want to just go somewhere away from all the fuss) and often, I'd get so nervous that concentrating on people talking seems almost impossible.  I would also start biting my nails (to the point where they'd almost bleed) when I get into situations like that.  And I don't think I've ever been comfortable giving people eye contact.  But from what I've found out or been told about it, those are just some of the classic signs of Asperger's Syndrome.  The one thing about GPs it seems, a lot of the time they don't suggest such conditions unless a: it's highly obvious and/or causes somewhat violent behavioral problems, unexplained mood swings etc. or b: they prefer someone else to suggest the idea first (whether a teacher, parent, etc).  At least that's the way it is with many of the GPs I've ever met.  Possibly because some parents may be in denial or get angry at such suggestions.  So, a GP may notice, but may be worried about saying anything in case you react badly to it.  But that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't help you.  The best thing to do is to mention your concerns about it and see if they can work on making a diagnosis for your son's condition.  And if they simply try to dismiss the suggestion, you can either go and get a second opinion or just keep insisting that they help you and your son (and don't take no for an answer).  Sometimes you have to get pushy to get the help you need.  Anyway, good luck for you and your son and I hope you get the help you're looking for.  =o)

        If you have read about autism it is a marked impairment in social, communication and the presence of a repetitive behavior.  How is his speech, is he talking?  It appears the onset of his seizures were when he was one year old.  Did anyone at the hospital back in 2009 refer you to a neurologist for the seizures? What does your pediatrician say?  You should look at some of the screening tests like the m-chat to see if there red flags for autism.  I am not a doctor but assuming the side effects of NOT taking the meds is ""not eating"" and ""temper tantrums"" is an assumption i wouldn't make.  I would take him to a professional.  If you are worried, you need to act and not sit and take the wait and see approach.  There are good professionals who can help you get intervention services he may need even if he doesn't have an autism diagnosis.  He sounds like he has sensory issues with food and there are OT professionals who that as well.
Hope this helps a little.  I know this is a worriesome time but get the right help and you will get the right answers. Listening to others thoughts are ok but you need to seek out the professionals who are experienced and qualified & trust your motherly instincts.

        I would formerly have him diagnosed.  It sounds like the suggestion has been made and the signs and symptoms are compelling.  My son is 11 and has PDD-NOS (also part of the autism spectrum).  He was diagnosed when he was 8.  I have been doing a lot of research recently and am now advocating for autism and my son.  Based upon the delay in speech, spinning to ground himself, his solitary classroom involvement, and his above average intelligence I think there are enough signs for a possible diagnosis.  

Go with your instinct.  Stop second guessing yourselves.  I did that too which is why my son didn't get diagnosed until he was 8 and becoming harmful to himself and others.  It's because I was being told that I just needed to be more consistent and it was because he had the run of the house as a toddler and he was the boss of my husband and I, which really wasn't so.  

There are no two children alike on the spectrum.  It's very hard to get an accurate diagnosis.  For more information and a great resource check out www.autismspeaks.org

        This is exactly what we have gone through.  I always find it funny that when she is in one of her ""spells"", they seem open to listening.  We have a wonderful doctor and psychologist who have listened from the very beginning and agreed that something was not right.  However, we are in a small town and there is only so much they can do.  I am to the point that I will do whatever or take her wherever she needs to go.  I am absolutely tired of people blowing me off or saying her case is too complicated!  
Does your son make eye contact or play with any other children in his class?  My daughter has two friends that she will make eye contact with and play with and talk to.  However, she will not initiate talk or play with the others.  (Although, I think she may eventually would.)  She also only makes eye contact with people she is familiar with.  During her speech eval. at the hospital, she made 0 eye contact with the pathologist.
Thanks for your post.

        How old is your daughter? I can see why you might think autism, given the social aspects but autism is usually a range of behaviors and delays. There is no set test for autism, your daughter would have to evaluated by an expert. My daughter was diagnosed by a child psychologist. You may want to start there. Good Luck.

        Thank you for answering my question, as far as being concerned with her development, we have been concerned since she was about 2 months old (10 weeks) when she slept for over an entire week and was hospitalized (later learning that she had a liver infection-whether it was from that or something else, they don't know). At the age of 6 months she still wasn't smiling or laughing and had generalized hypotonia. It took us until she was almost 1 before we could get some help for her, it orginally was for dysphia when her speech therapist noticed that she might have SPD. It was 2 weeks later an OT agreed and she started intense therapy for SPD. She is a very hypersensitive child with all 7 of her senses. She doesn't understand social cues from other people, when I am upset with her I have to show her my face and ask if I look happy at her-and tell her that I am not, doesn't have the traditional imaginative play others her age do. For example, she ""plays"" with her dolls but instead of talking to them and acting like a mom she would rather carry them around in their carrier or in the backpack, nothing more. She also has an adult like humor that other children don't seem to understand, not that she would talk to them. She doesn't like to spin, but she likes to watch other things spin. When she was a baby, it was the ceiling fan and now it's anything that spins from ice skating to chairs to car wheels. She has a fascination with red cars, no other type-just red. She does like to have her schedule the same as much as possible and when it's way off, she is not comfortable and will cry and refuse to do anything else but stay at home. She also likes to watch her movies over and over again and can recite one of them word for word -even before the character says it. 

When it comes to the anxiety and OCD-she washes her hands for hours at a time if I let her. She has to get in the car a certain way, be buckled a certain way, go to bed a certain way, get dressed the same way, go up and down stairs a certain way, milk has to be made a certain way, scared to ""go fast"" in the car since she believes we are going to ""run over a car"", scared to sleep alone-afraid of the ""niner"" (a make believe character that comes at 9 o'clock) and of the dark because of it. Scared of ""the guy""-any man besides her father. We have no idea why, she can't even explain it. Clothing has to match and knows when it's not and will undress herself and refuse to wear it until it matches -including her hairbows or even the rubber bands and her socks. Can only wear one brand of diapers (she is not even close to being potty trained as of yet).
I hope that gives you a little more insight to my daughter.

You also should post this question to the genetics forum. I believe that they have not indentified all the genes that might cause autism.

        Hi
I have a four year old daughter with autism.  I know exactly what you are going through. Although you're freaking out right now, and rightfully so, it will get better.  To help you I need to know where you live, what country because it's different everywhere.
First thing...don't yell at him or punish him.  I think the first thing you need to do is to learn about him.  He's still your boy whom you always knew, but there's a completely other level to him you need to learn about.  You need to understand autism.  What kinds of things is he doing that you feel you need to punish him for?  I may be able to help a bit and let you know if this is a characteristic of autism or just typical three year old behavior.  I still have a hard time figuring that one out too and we've had our diagnoses for a year.  I read a lot about Autism and go to as many classes, workshops, or seminars as I can and or afford.  Note though, if it is tantrums don't punish him.  He's doing them for a reason and usually it's because they can't communicate with you or understand what's going on around them.  Our world is very scary to these guys.
You need to remember that he doesn't perceive the world as we do.  Where is he on the spectrum?  He is in a totally different world than you and it's up to you to get into his world and bring him out.  I know that sounds trippy and really scary but I can explain this more if you tell me more about your son.  I have lots of info and suggestions as to where you can learn more if you are interested.  Remember you're not alone and neither is he.  These children are gifts to the world and will teach you so much and will humble you.  Every little achievement my daughter makes I go nuts over.  I was so proud of her when she finally understood the concept of yes at three or learned to play patty cake at three.  You'll appreciate so much more.  All the best :)  I hope I can help you out.

        I worked with a girl that had Asperger's and as time went on with lots of patience she learned to adapt to society and was even in the jr high then high school band- percussion. Anything memorized could be expected high scores on school work but as she got older, more complex ideas and higher level thinking skills showed to be frustrating for her. You can still have the work modified- She learned to read easily using phonics since she could learn all the phonics rules.
We used lots of modeling to show her different reactions to things so she could memorize those- for instance when she was old enough- around age 10-we told her spelling words for her tests sometimes would be out of order - not always the way she had studied them in sequence..... something that always sent her into a meltdown.... We taught her to say things like- ""oh it's ok"" and ""maybe next time"". She saw a child psychiatrist for several visits who prescribed anti anxiety meds which helped A LOT. (Zoloft) Her family doctor then took over prescribing these and of course had to increase the meds and monitor as she aged.
You can also teach social skills by modeling - we taught her to ask ""how are you today?"" and TRY to listen to the answer to play into a conversation. write me if you need to chat

        Hello, My name is Melanie, and our 3yr old son was diagnosed with autism right before he turned 2. I suggest you take your son to a neurologist and a pediatric specialist who might be able to diagnose him if anything is wrong..being he is young, it might be hard to tell yet.  But EI (early intervention) is great but as you may know it must be done before he is 3yrs old.  I'm hoping that your son is completely fine, and doing typical behavior at his age.  But if he does happen to be on the autism spectrum then I seriously suggest you treat him with RDI (relationship development intervention).  I try to pass this on to as many families as i can, as this seems to be the best for autistic children.  You can see if there are any special instruction teachers in EI who specialize in autism and RDI.  Any other doctor or SI teacher will probably tell you to do ABA or VBA..which trains your child like a robot,and will teach them skills..but do NOT help with autism, on the contrary it will only push them further toward the autism path rather than away from it.  Unfortunatly RDI is not well known, so that is why you will be told to do speech, ABA, VBA..etc, because that is all they know.  Trust me on this.  Our son has almost fully recovered from autism with the use of RDI.

        Oh my..I am reading about your 4yr old boy Andrew, and this is the same thing we went through with our son  Andrew who is now 31/2.  He was born typical and healthy, almost advanced. He was almost 2 when he got his MMR shot, and everything went downhill from there.  He stopped talking, making eye contact, started lining things up like blocks or cars ( long lines ) and hardly ever responded to his name anymore.  He also would make strange noises when playing on his own, and if we had our young cousins or his friends over he acted as if they were invisible.  We were devestated to learn from a pediatric specialist that he was indeed on the autism spectrum diagnosed with PDD.  Of course he recommended ABA, and VBA which we definitly did not do..and we had him evaluated with early intervention and he got that for a yr. since he was 2..and now he goes to a special preschool.  The preschools for special needs are okay..but will not help him if he is autistic...so what we are also doing is RDI on the side which we pay for (not very expensive).  When Andrew was in EI his special intruction teacher happened to specialize in autism and RDI..and we learned sooooo much from her, and I will pass this on to as many families as I can.  RDI is relationship development intervention and seems to me to be the only option that can greatly improve and in most cases help children recover from autism.  The schools will teach him skills, help him go to the potty, etc, but it will not help his autism.  Basically the only thing my son gets out of preschool is he goes to the potty now, and loves the guy who comes in with his guitar and sings, and likes to play with the children..but the social interaction piece was gained back with our work at home and using RDI.  I don't know if your son will still line things up, or get mad if you move them..but if so you know in autism other things come with that like ocd.  RDI will also help with that, we were constantly changing things up because autistic children are afraid of the unknown, and don't know what people expect of them and therefore only want things the way they want them, and usually has to have it the same way all of the time.

        I'm certainly not qualified to answer, but I wanted to respond to you & just send you some love & support.  My son is autistic, so I'm at least aware of diagnoses a bit.  It doesn't sound like Aspergers to me.  Is he receiving good medical care?  Are his seizures being managed?  Seizure activity and violent mood swings would seem to indicate some psychopharmacological intervention. The fact that he responds so well to music & had difficulty with math makes it seem to be left hemisphere related.  I would get him to as many top medical facilities as possible, those with a state of the art neurology group.  I don't know what state you're in, but you should (even with the budget cuts) be able to receive disability for him, which would allow you to bring some caregivers into the home.  Blessings to you.

        I can't comment about the delays but I have a 2 year old also.  The rapid mood swings are typical of what I saw in both my boys and in other normal 2 year old children we play with.  The question is does he have the behavior problems (biting hitting etc) in all situations or is he normally better with someone in particular.  I've discovered my 2 year old never hits or bites at preschool but at home he feels its a way to get my attention when I'm working with my other child or he does it when he doesn't get his way with his brother.  

I hope that helps a bit.

To: lotti82
I recommend that you take your child to your pediatrician and provide him with the information you have listed here (I am sure that your pediatrician will have additional questions for you as well).  What you describe is not typical of children with Asperger’s Disorder, per se, but certainly constitute serious challenging behavior by any child.  If you already have a referral in to your medical and social professionals, you have done the best you can for the time being (you should also continue to work with them for a differential diagnosis if that would aid in accessing services).  Once the behavior support team is involved, I strongly recommend that you work closely with them to develop some behavior plans to increase the appropriate behaviors that you can then reinforce as alternative to the list you have above.  They will no doubt be recommending ways for you to change your child’s behavior for the better.  Although it may be difficult at first, try your best to follow their recommendations and “stick with it”.  Please note: I am not saying follow the advice blindly.  Ask lots of questions, but if the team gives you recommendations for specific procedures that are based on solid principles of applied behavior analysis, it is likely your best option for helping your son.   

i have filled a caf form in and the school nurse is working with them to help they have offered the 10 week triple p course to help but i dont feel 10 weeks will resolve the issue do you have any idea what it sounds like and what i can do in the mean time or what steps to take next

        Hi,
I totally understand your concerns.  You didn't mention his age? As you have probably have read, autism spectrum disorders involve more than just stimming (repetitive behavior).  It sounds like you read up on how to diagnosis and he sounds social, and he is communicating and imitating which is great.  Hard to tell how delayed in communication since we don't know his age.  

My son who just turned 2 likes to follow vertical lines from the corner of his eyes while running past things and is speech delayed- with 15 words.  He is in early intervention because of this weird behavior and delay and speech.  The EI team came and they were saying no to autism but i was not so sure.  I actually video taped it and took him to a neurologist.  Since my son was easily distracted from the activity and he didn't do it alot, she wasn't too concerned.  Actually i can't remember when he did it last and it appears it comes and goes.  She asked me a lot of questions about his ""social"" abilities, had him do some activities, watched his eye contact which was good and said b/c he doesn't do that activity alot meaning --what is his normal play activity?  Does he play with toys appropriately and engage in other play activites?  Is the stimming your son does alot, obsessive, can you interrupt him without a tantrum? 

To ease your mind i would contact your doctor for a referral to the early intervention team (if he is under 3 yrs old). In NY you don't need a referral from your pediatrician but they can give you the number.   They are absolutely wonderful.  They see alot of kids and they can guide you with your concerns. 

Hope this helps.  Everything with your son will be ok just seek out some help from the professionals and you will feel better.

        I have an Aspie 12 year old daughter who acted the same way toward me as your son to you.  She would say mean things to me, too, but deep down, I always knew it was the AS talking.  I'm not going to say it doesn't hurt emotinally, but try to logically acknowledge that due to his AS he is not capable of showing those emotions.  Luckily, once my daugther hit puberty emotions started gushing out of her and she will often now tell me how much she loves me.  This just confirmed to me that I was right all along--they feel it, but do not know how to express it, and quite possibly their ""logic"" overrides their feelings.  Good luck to you and your son.

I know there are programs in ABA that adress compliance, but both OT and Speech therapist beleived that it may very well make him more defiant and less willing to learn


We did have ABA therapist come to our house, she did some training with us, but she sis not beleive he needs one-on-one therapy......

        I have a 24 mth old who sounds exactly like your son, except more delayed in speech with only like 7 words.  The doctors advice is so correct that with the increase in awareness of autism, we mom's, get very concerned and rightly so.  I am starting speech and special ed in a week and am very excited to see what progress will be made since his speech and comprehension is significantly delayed. Even though the early intervention team is saying NO to autism i still am wondering since i have read everything on the topic.  You are doing the right thing with Early intervention to help him with his Developmental delays.  I'll share a funny story about my paranoia.  I went so far as to buy blocks and more cars & animals to see if he would be stuck on stacking them or lining them.  Guess what?  My 4 year old started to stack the blocks and line up his animals all around the tub not my 2 year old.  My 4 yr old is clearly not autistic.  It was God's way of saying to me, that normally developing children can exhibit some of the same traits as autistic kids and not be autistic.

Hope this helped.

        One of his goals is to stop taking the medicine for awhile.  There is sometimes slight improvement in behavior or so in the next week (decreased lethargy, seemingly reduced depression, etc.), but in all of the attempts he has tried, was always followed by a much worse bout of mania or extreme anxiety that necessitated more hospitalization and the need to go back onto the medicine.

As a child, he was slightly weird (showed his penis to random people in the playground in elementary school, banged his head against the wall sometimes during junior high school [and did it a few times recently, really hard]).  However, we never suspected he had autistic spectrum disorder.

He was always a good artist and drew extremely well when he was younger, but hasn't drawn much at all in the past few years.

Over the past few years he has been in and out of the hospital for reasons such as the above.  At the hospital, he has had conflicts with the staff (showed his genitals to the nurses, sleeps outside on the field even though he has a bed, ran away from the hospital [necessitating helicopter searches], etc.).

He sometimes have bouts where he moves his arms and legs in weird ways and seems to have little control over keeping them still, during which he cannot communicate well (we ask him ""what are you doing?"" he says ""i ... can't ... "" and has a lot of trouble completing the sentence, often swearing).

We have tried therapy but he did not communicate with the therapists, so they gave up.  We have tried counselling -- same result.  We have tried many types of medication, none of which seem to be perfect for bringing him back to his old self. 

What we have considered him having (** = certain, ? = unlikely):
Asperger's Syndrome
Autistic Spectrum Disorder
Bipolar Disorder
Depression **
Rett's Syndrome? (seems like something that occurs since childhood)
ADD
Tourette's
Schizophrenia
Delusional Disorder
Insanity

Please help; we have tried for the past few years and we still don't know exactly what he has; the doctors don't know either (they have labelled him as having autistic spectrum disorder but nothing beyond that).  It is starting to drive us insane as well, especially with recent behavior.  Thank you...

        Hi
I also work with a young adult with severe Autism whom smeres feces as well.  I am not sure of the age range that your speaking with or what type of setting that your in.  We are a community  residential setting.  The guys that we work with have access to helping us do chores even if they are prompted or hand over hand.  When our guy smeres we have him help clean it up hand over hand.  It is not pleasent for neither.  He hates the gloves he has to wear and also hates to help. Then we get him to put the soiled clothes towels etc in the laundry. But, within a couple weeks he is no longer smereing.  We do still get the odd time.  But if this is a school setting it would be not a great place to work on the behaviour.  

When he was in school and he did  this we would do a round of sensory activities before toileting him.  This seemed to help a bit.  We made up a bunch of containers with lids.  In the containers we a variety of different scents.  Anything from coffee to vanilla to materials to spices.  This seems to satisfy the need to smell anything innapropiate.

This also worked with my own two children who have Autism.

        I did mention to my son's pediatrician about how he can repeat words but not really use them and how he identified objects in his book but since then occasionally does.  She said mimicking was normal.  I guess I am most worried about the pointing, he doesn't follow the direction of my pointing when I try to point out something, he will look at my hand, or sometimes will, but only when very close to the object.  I also mentioned to her that he has never really slept through the night, he wakes up 1hr-3hrs after he first falls to sleep by me rocking him to sleep.  I then either rock him back to sleep or put him in the bed with us, as I am still nursing, he then goes back to sleep but with about 4 more wakings with nursing.  To this she said it sounded like it was a learned behavior and that I need to let him cry it out- which I am opposed to right now.  I also must confess he probably watches more TV than he should, which are all children's programming, while I cook or clean. Could this have an effect on the some of these behaviors?

        My 20 month old son has some similar characteristics and I am just now looking into possible Autism. He does look us in the eye but does not maintain that eye contact. He will respond to his name most of the time, but when asked to do something, he usually stares off into ""space"" and won't follow through. He seems to be in his own little world, however he does play socially with others. He has no words other than da-da and ma-ma sometimes. He says buh-buh for just about everything and will say uh-oh sometimes. We are in the process of having him evaluated for speech/OT for food/oral aversions. He will only eat crunchy food and nothing with any type of soft/wet textures. We've been told that he quite likely has a sensory disorder, but I'm wondering if it could be more, possibly on the Autism spectrum. Any thoughts/suggestions?

        Thank you for your comments.  The psychiatrist is supposed to be an autism specialist, and there are not too many in our city who claim that.  My daughter is getting her masters in Pub Admin and is researching insurance coverage for autism--it is such a fight between insurers and schools as to who should pay for services, and meanwhile our kids are the ones suffering.

Saw a special about Risperdol and how boys are growing breasts; my grandson is on that medication and it scares the heck out of me.  We want to wean him from this drug--he is not psychotic--why on earth would one prescribe this med for autism and Clonidine to help him sleep (isn't this med for adults?)?  We don't want to keep him medicated just so it is easier on everyone else--he has to come first. Can you shed some light on these topics?  Thank you.

        Well, I'm not a doctor but I don't think any 11 year old should be talking like that. Have you notified the school board about the child's actions? If you haven't yet you should immediately. And the parents should definitely be concerned about their child's actions. It doesn't sound like they're very good parents if they let him run around like a psycho threatening kids half his age. Like I said, I'd make sure the school knows about this and are monitoring that child.

        Thanks for the reply.  It helps to know someone else understands. Regarding having Steve tested...The school counselor thinks he's fine.  He is not a trouble maker or loud or disruptive so they don't see a problem.  I consulted a pediatrician with these problems last year.  He tested Steve for ADD Inattentive.  Nothing there.  People think Steve is lazy or shy or stupid or just not paying attention.  He is not trying to be any of these things.  He just doesn't know how to talk to people or stand up for himself.  You mention the McDonalds incident.  I can definitely see that happening.  Steve thinks he is a very good kid and doesn't understand why we punish him at times for his lack of effort around the house.  I feel bad punishing his because I don't think he can help it, but I'm trying to teach him life skills.  Do you have any idea where I could have him evaluated.  Even if he is diagnosed with something, I don't think there is any cure.  But maybe I could educate teachers and others about his condition.  Maybe it would help Steve if he knew why people were mean to him.  Not sure...

        My son was suspected to have Asperger's at the age of 2, but where we live it was difficult to get the actual diagnosis until he was 5.  He was still treated for it w/o the diagnosis.  His eyes do that as well, but not a lot.  I have only noticed a couple of times.  Best advice I can give you is appreciate your son.  Autism is not a horrible thing.  My son is wonderful.  He had early intervention....he started a special ed class at a regular public school at the age of 3....he only went 3 days a week at first and went full time at age 4.  He is now 7 and is smarter than most 10 yr olds.  He is in 1st grade and is on a 2nd and 3rd grade regular ed academic level without any problems.  His teacher feels he could probably get on a 5th grade level without it even being challenging but chooses to try to keep him at the same level as most of the kids his age since it's the social aspect that is most challenging in this case.  If the high functioning autism your son has is Asperger's....keep in mind he is hyper sensitive.  He hears things louder so he will talk louder ( and oh, he will talk...sometimes way too much....and very proper).  He tastes more, so foods are a big issue b/c of texture and flavor ( you don't like too much salt on your food do you?).  Remember that what ever you put in his food he will taste at least double what you taste.  Loud noises are a problem so if hair cuts are an issue find someone who has silent clippers or buy some yourself and have the hair dresser use those.  My son has improved in his ability to handle these situations or maybe he is just becoming accustomed to them, but cutting his nails is still a work out for me.  If your son shows signs of Attention Deficit Disorder....that is common....Concerta is the best med for that.  Also, any aggression is common in Asperger's kids.  My son takes Risperdol at night to help with that.  He is just very easily frustrated if things don't go perfectly for him and this also helps him sleep better at night.  With the combination of the two....wow, he is a calm, smart, loving little boy that is crazy about his baby sister (they don't tend to be very jealous because they crave less attention and affection, although, my son has never pulled away from me...he has never begged me to hold him, either).  He is just cleaner.  He hates to have anything messy on him.  He also doesn't like to go outside and play much because he is terrified of bugs...all bugs, flies, gnats, etc!

        Hello,
I'm not a doctor but I do have three sons who are on the autism spectrum.  My firstborn, who is now 17 years old, was first diagnosed with ADHD at the age of five.  I knew there was something more to that diagnosis because he would do things that even as a first time parent I knew it wasn't right.  He had incredible fears of flying insects and would run and hide under tables or complete run off from his classroom, he would never make eye contact, he responded to situations literally all the time, etc.  This was in 1995 when the dx of Asperger's was not that common.  I finally pushed enough and was sent to a psychiatrist with my son who knew immediately that he had Asperger's. 
To answer your question directly, you can have more than one diagnosis.  I believe the term to use is co-morbid (again I could be wrong but I believe that it is).  It means that you can have more than one dx.  That's the thing with autism (or lots of other dx's), you can have autism but have epilepsy (very true) or you can have autism and have ADHD (the hyper activity part especially for my sons).  My oldest, for example, has Asperger's Syndrome, epilepsy, ADHD (he's still on two meds for that), ODD (he picks his scalp to the point he has a hole in it), depression (very common in autism, as well as many other life altering dx), and finally insomnia (all three of my sons need meds to SLEEP).

As for the more services with the PDD-NOS dx, I don't know about that, my school district doesn't recognize that dx so my youngest (who b/c of many of dx - mainly he was born with a cleft lip and palate - has been given that dx b/c they don't know where exactly to place him on the spectrum) has not received more services because of that dx.  His dr gave him that dx for the same reason yours did - the only difference being we know he's on the spectrum, just don't know where.

Anyway sorry for my rambling reply - the bottom line is they can have more than one dx (in my humble opinion).

All the best,
Chezbug

        just stopping by to send my sympathy towards your situation. my son is almost 18mos old and we've been wondering about autism as well. i really don’t have any suggestions since I’m new to this all, but his pediatrician did mention the hearing thing once (which is not a problem for my son), so as you mentioned that could have a lot to do with some problems your son is experiencing. Also, my son's dr mentioned that most times in autism the children aren't very emotional, etc. Which, from what you say you're son is a cuddle bug like mine (don't you love that?!) and smiles a lot. My son clapped his hands for a while, then stopped and wouldn't do it no matter what we did to try to get him to do it, then all of a sudden people were clapping on the radio and he started clapping! He also did this with high5's... he'd do it on command for a while, then decided he wouldn't do it anymore but sometimes decides to demand someone give him a high5. Also, you can yell my son's name a million time but he wont acknowledge you until he's good and ready... seems like he can't hear you or something, then all of a sudden I’ll get his attention...that i have heard is a good symptom of autism. I'd hang in there with going to a ton of specialists yet. Maybe your son is just a little later to develop with some stuff? (I know you probably hate hearing that, that's what everyone always tells me about my son and his speech). Children's behavior is so mysterious sometimes, I def know it can be stressful and worrisome. Sorry I don't have any advice, just letting you know I can relate to the worry something like this causes. Hang in there! And good luck! 

Also, have you taken any of the ""quizzes"" for autism? I found this one online, which is actually very similar to the test my son's pediatrician uses at pt's 18mo & 24mo exams routinely..... the MCHAT.....the site is.....

        I am the mother of an 8 year old boy on the autistic spectrum.  He is high functioning and goes to a school that is a mixture of those on the spectrum and mainstream children.  He went to a mainstream only school to begin with and he wasn't diagnosed until he was 6, although I had raised a number of concerns from about age 3.
I've also gone over onto YouTube and have looked at your videos.
In my opinion she is showing autistic characteristics and also alot of sensory issues.
From your post I presume she has a diagnosis of PDD NOS?  What part of the diagnostic criteria for an autistic spectrum disorder did she fail on?
I am in the UK, and the definition of 'education' in the UK is not limited to just reading and writing.  It includes social interaction and play skills, life skills, emotional regulation and anxiety regulation etc.  
So, in short, I disagree with the school.
Is she in a mainstream school?
Just because a child is not showing inappropriate or disruptive behaviours, does not mean they don't have needs.  If your child cannot play with other children she has a need in that area that should be met with a programme from a speech and language therapist.  She should be going to a Social Skills Group, she should have adult support during playtimes and dinnertimes and she should be being taught how to initiate social interaction (as a starter) and play and the adult on the playground should be helping her to use the skills she has learnt on how to initiate from the SALT.  Those targets and how they will be met should be in her IEP, and it should be monitored and recorded how she is doing with this skills.  And that is just one aspect.
She is showing alot of sensory behaviour.  Covering her ears in the bathroom, making sure it doesn't involve a shower (many have tactile problems and showers may actually hurt them).  The bathroom has a different acoustics.  She vomits easily.  She flaps and spins.  She has a body movement she does rhythmically using her upper torso.  She should be assessed by an Occupational Therapist and a programme put into place on how to help her with these issues and what kind of environmental adaptation she needs to cope in school.  It maybe that in school she has less problems.  But she needs to be assessed for that to be certain and to ascertain what it is in the home or school environment that she likes or cannot cope with.
I would also recommend a book by a woman called Olga Bogdashina called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  There is a caregivers questionnaire at the back of it that you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.
As children typically find visual information helps them understand, you could make up a daily timetable for home which shows in picture form what she is going to do on that day.  As she is verbal start to ask her about what is upsetting her.  For example, in the bathroom, ask her ""is the noise from the water hurting your ears"", or ""does it hurt your skins when you have a shower"".  Whatever she tries to avoid ask her a direct question, not an open ended one.  Don't ask her 'why', she's too young and may not even know why herself.  She appears not to like soap, ask her ""does the smell of the soap bother you.""  ""does the soap make your skin feel itchy"". etc.  You might get some surprising answers.  But just believe whatever she says is a true experience for her.  I have sensory issues myself, and I am not on the spectrum.  But I have auditory processing difficulties, CAPD, touch oversensitivities (If someone touches me I can still feel it for minutes afterwards, some touch hurts), I cannot wear tags in clothes or wear man made fibres, I cannot bear certain smells to the extent that I will vomit or have to leave the building or bus.

        You can ask your GP for a referal to a multi disciplinary team that has experience of diagnosing Aspergers.  But for Aspergers he must have had typical language development.  You can also google DSM IV for the diagnostic criteria and see if that sounds relevant.
Alot of what you describe is Sensory Integration Disorder.  That can be a diagnosis in itself, but also accompanies autistic spectrum disorders including aspergers.  
A book that I found very useful was by a woman called Olga Bogdashina called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  This will explain more about how they perceive sensory information differently.  Alot of people recommend Tony Attwood books regarding Aspergers because they are easy to read.
I'm not sure about him being afraid of the neighbours boys.  Have they bullied him or teased him in the past?  Or he might have been anxious about this unexpected meeting in the streets and tried to avoid it.

        If you google Temple Grandin (you probably have heard of her), and read her experiences of sensory perceptual difficulties, you will see that she says that she believes all those on the spectrum have sensory perceptual differences ranging from mild to severe.
These difficulties are ususally called Sensory Integration Disorder and it is an OT who would assess and put together a programme.  However OTs understanding of what is going on is somewhat limited.  There are autistic and aspergers people writing about it themselves eg. www. donnawilliams.net.  And there are professionals working with them to discuss these difficulties ie. Olga Bogdashina.  
These types of sensory issues are not new.  They were raised back in the 1960's by Delacatto who did a number of studies into how sensory information was perceived.
It is possible to have Sensory Integration Disorder without autism or aspergers.  But I haven't met anyone on the spectrum who didn't have some sensory issues.
I have some sensory processing difficulties, but I am not autistic.  My difficulties are around tactile (clothes, tags, fabrics etc - and feeling touch as painful), over sensitive smell, auditory processing problems (CAPD), poor balance.  But it fluctuates.  So I have good days and bad days.
Why would school think she cannot have aspergers because she is ahead of her peers academically?  There is a whole range of intelligence levels for those on the spectrum as in the typical population.  Even Einstein is suspected of having autistic traits.
You can also google the DSM IV diagnostic criteria for autism and aspergers and see yourself what the characteristics are.
I presume she does have a diagnosis?  It is always better to get a diagnosis through Health rather than through just school, and you need a multi disciplinary team to assess her that has experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders, including aspergers.  This should involve a Speech and Language Therapist (to assess language and social interaction and play skills), and an Educational/Clinical Psychologist as well as a Paediatrician.
The only real difference between ASD and Aspergers appears to be the requirement that the child acquited typical language development in Aspergers.  However even if they do have typical language (expressive), they still need to be assessed because their receptive language may be at a totally different level.  They may have problems with processing language or CAPD, or auditory or working memory problems.  They sometimes have Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder (literal and concrete thinking).

        I completely understand. My 12 yr old son was diagnosed 5 mths ago with Asperger's Syndrome. It had been suggested to me over the years to get him tested but I thought my son was fine and would grow out of his odd behaviors. It wasnt until last year when I went back to school to be a nurse that I really started to realize through my training that my son had an autistic spectrum disorder. The treatment that seems to work the best for Aspie kids usually envolves a behavior analyst. The best thing you can do for your soon is to have him get an actual diagnosis rather than just a self diagnosis. With a diagnosis it will open up doors for him to recieve additional services from schools and medical professionals such as special schools and more intense interventions. It is our job as parents to be our childs advocate. If you get your son a diagnosis the school will be required to pay for the services he needs to succeed in school.

        This is just an idea.  But you could try seeing a nutricianist so that they can firstly look at what she is eating and drinking to make sure it is balanced.  They would then be able to advise you on some vitamins and minerals that might aid her immune systems and also help to keep detoxing.  Nothing drastic, just good common sense stuff ie. remove all caffine and stimulants and sugar from the diet, lots of water, herbal teas with nettle extract (I find blackberry and nettle good), vitamin B complex and vitamin C complex etc.  But take advice, because she is only 7 and you don't want to overdose her on any vitamins as too many can be as bad as too little.  Goats milk soap is very good for the skin, I have heard that epsom salts baths can also be good.
Organic food if you can afford it - or grow your own.  Exercise is also good.
Do you think she might have an allergy to any pets?  If you suspect dust mites you can replace carpets with wooden floors and only keep a few stuffed toys which you wash at above 60 degrees or which you freeze overnight to kill mites.  
You can also buy air filters that can take allergens out of the air in the house.  
Make sure all washing materials in the house are all organic, or make your own - it is easy to do and more effective than the stuff you buy.

If you also google to find similar characteristics between those on the autistic spectrum and those with hearing difficulties you will see that there are some similar difficulties.  But those with only hearing loss do go on to learn the skills that those on the spectrum always have difficulty with (however children on the spectrum can be affected in this, or any area, severely or mildly).  This is just my own opinion, but the reason I think that the two types of children develop similar speech and social characteristics is because many on the autistic spectrum have language processing difficulties to such an extent that they are getting about the same amount of auditory information as a child with hearing difficulties.  So although they aren't deaf and can 'hear' they can't actually process alot of what is said at the time it is being said, which maybe similar to how some children with hearing difficulties pick up certain aspects of a word or a sentence, but maybe not enough of it to get the full picture.
So get him into a programme with an experienced SALT as above and ask them to also teach you how to communicate with him and also how to interact socially.
Your post is showing that he is showing an interest in other people eg. asking where mummy is, and he is also wanting to interact eg. asking if you want to go outside with him.  Children on the spectrum tend to come across as very self sufficient and don't tend to seek interaction and play to the extent that their peers do.  Many can be quite content in their own company for most of the day or they can go to the other extreme and always want someone with them, but only to follow their instructions or meet the child's needs eg. I want a drink, I'm hungry, turn on the TV, and not interacting and chatting with them as other children do.
But I would also mention to the SALT about characteristics similar in children with autism and hearing difficulties so that she can explain that to you.
If you persist in having these concerns then you can ask for your child to have a full assessment by a team of professionals that are experienced in diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders in children who also have hearing difficulties.

        I am a mum of an 8 year old boy with high functioning autism.  You can google DSM IV Aspergers and read the diagnostic criteria for that.  
As  you say, many of the behaviours and traits can be seen as strengths.  However in our social world I think you can see that his language and social interaction difficulties are going to cause him some problems as well as he need to keep to routines.  His need for rules and inflexibility is going to cause him stress and anxiety.  He also sounds like he may have some sensory issues.  
My son also appears very independent.  Unfortunately it is not that they are 'independent', it is because they don't get social interaction, otherwise they would ask for things or help to get things rather than attempt to do stuff themselves.  
Infact tonight, I was upstairs doing homework with my daughter, when my son came into the bedroom to apologise to me.  I asked him ""what are you saying sorry for"", and he said ""for losing the dog, but don't worry I found him now"".  I always keep our house doors/windows locked, so I asked him ""what have you done""?  And he told me that he had wanted to go next door to say hello to the neighbours.  But because the front door and side gate was locked, he went down the garden, climbed over the wall into their garden and went and knocked on their door.  When he went into the garden the dog got out through the hedge and was on the road.  He called it to come back in and it did, and he returned back over the wall and into the house.  And I missed all that in 20 min!!!  Now, on the one hand, he was trying to be social.  But everything was inappropriate.  He is 8 and he should not leave the house without telling me.  He shouldn't climb over walls into other people's property.  He let the dog escape.  He didn't come to get help he tried to solve it himself.  Then he thought about what he had done, decided he had made a bad call and came to apologise.  
Your son will have some similar issues.  He may tend to talk at people rather than hold a two way conversation.  At the moment he is 4 and children can be quite forgiving at that age (they can also be nasty too), but I would advise you to find the right educational environment for him, which ideally would be in a school that has other pupils with Aspergers and has experience and expertise in teaching them academically and socially as well as teaching them life skills.  That maybe in a mainstream school, or it maybe in a mixtured environment.  
I don't think his difficulties are down to being an only child.

Teenage years for me and many other Aspergers people are very difficult.  Acceptance by our peers, understanding of gender issues, relationships and rejection are overwhelming.  I was always fighting bullies, saying the wrong thing, getting over stimulated around other children and going down in my grades.

Have you considered social skill development, coping strategies, awareness/understanding of his Aspergers with a psychologist that specialises in Aspergers.  Sex education is understated as an issue for aspergers teenagers and there some books on the market to assist parents.  Try googling for these books.

In some instances medication is essential for well-being, I personally found medical Doctors preescribe what they do not understand.  Actually that is their amin function, to medicate.  Try counselling for your son first.

BTW stimulant meds like Adderall  can cause increased anxiety, irrritability/aggression and sleep problems.  Seek out a Clinical psychologist who specialises in Aspergers, my experience with meds is negative and many other aspergers people state the same.  Our disorder is neurological, not mental health.  We can develop mental health disorder from continuous social rejection and trying to understand this world.

        I am not a professional, I am a mother of an 8 year old boy with high functioning autism.  Finding the right educational setting is crucial for both their education and self esteem.  What I did, which you could consider, is I had a private report done by a Speech and Language Therapist who had experience of autistic spectrum disorders and speech disorders.  You need to find an independent professional not tied to the health or education service (because if they are independent they are more inclined to tell you what the child needs, as opposed to what the system provides).  They assessed his receptive and expressive speech, working memory, auditory memory, assessed him for auditory processing disorder and semantic pragmatic speech disorder.  She assessed his comprehension skills and information gaining skills using inference etc.  And she also assessed his social interaction skills.  That will give you a good idea of his areas of strength and weakness.  
Then we had a private Educational Psychologists report (independent as above), and they assessed his emotional understanding and response, his cognitive abilities (again using non-verbal assessments as he is autistic).  This gave us a very clear idea of his IQ.  You say your grandson's IQ is 90, but was that using non-verbal assessments, because if he has difficulties with language or language processing or meaning that will automatically bring his scores down and is not a true reflection of his intellectual level.  The EP was also experienced with autistic spectrum disorders and made a number of recommendations about teaching approaches etc.
These two reports should help give you a better idea of what type of schooling would best suit him.  The EP can actually be asked to visit the school to assess if she thinks the environment (ie. classroom structure/size, teaching strategies, experience etc) is going to be appropriate.
Although holding him back a year might make him fit in more at the beginning.  If he has social interaction difficulties they will remain unless they are addressed and he is taught (by teachers experienced with those on the spectrum) and supported during playtimes/dinnertimes.

Make sure that you don't agree to any procedures at home or any environment that you feel your child cannot cope with.  If sedation during any treatment is the only option take it and make sure that medical staff are aware of the reasons why that is the only option.  Make sure any consultants regarding the kidney issue are in contact with the a professional who knows your child well so that they can explain the issues around both autism and sensory difficulties.

        I would get a professional involved who is a going to put together an approach that all the family sticks to.  The most important thing is routine and consistency, so everyone has to be on board 100% of the time.  The consistency needs to be down to everything as very small changes to the environment, routine, words spoken as prompts etc can render it a whole new experience for him and he won't recognise it as the same thing.  An example of this is that about a year ago I went to have lunch with my son in a cafe.  He wanted fish fingers, but the waitress said ""they're not called fish fingers anymore they are called fish nuggets"".  That really upset him because he didn't know what ""fish nuggets"" were, eventhough he knows what chicken nuggets are, he couldn't use that information to guess what a fish nugget might be like.  He got very upset and was lying down on the floor screaming, whilst I was waiting at the checkout!!  And my son is high functioning autistic who goes to a mainstream school and was potty trained when he was 3.  So, if that small difference in language upset him so much, you can imagine how other changes you three adults make could upset him so much that he doesn't understand what he is expected to be doing.  Does that make sense?
I think the professional you need is a behavioural analyst and one who has experience of autism.  But all three of you need to sit down and agree on how you are going to do this.  It might be that only one person initially works on the programme and once he has learnt it it is then generalised out to the other adults.  That might make it easier and quicker for him to initially learn rather than having three different adults.  But obviously that is going to mean alot of work for that one person.  I would discuss your options with the BA.

        I am not an expert, I am a mum of an 8 year old boy on the autistic spectrum.
A multi disciplinary team assessment carried out by health professionals is usually the best way of getting a diagnosis because it is more indepth than through education for example.  There are lots of different characteristics of autism and a child only has to have enough of them to get a diagnosis.  No two children are the same.  My son also doesn't flap or spin (although he did spin sometimes as a toddler - but even then not so much that I thought it was an issue).
Your son is just at that age when he should be beginning to develop his social side.  If he is on the spectrum he will start to have difficulties with social interaction which may look like he is simply delayed because his peers will be developing these skills and he won't be, or he won't have the same level of skills.
Once you have a diagnosis you start to think about what educational setting will be appropriate.  In my experience I resulted to getting private reports done because I couldn't get anyone to test my son so that I knew what his strengths and weaknesses were.  I was repeatedly told that ""children on the spectrum typically have difficulties with x y and z"".  But, for example, if a child has difficulties with social interaction is that because of (a) language difficulties  (ai) problems with receptive language; (aii) problems with auditory processing; (aiii) problems with comprehension or inference, (b) sensory or environmental difficulties, (c) executive function difficulties etc.  And depending on what is the 'root' problem the approach, strategy or therapy will be different.  Does that make sense??
So typically a private report by a Speech and Language Therapist and Educational Psychologist should give you a very clear idea of what his difficulties are.  The Ed Psych should also be able to tell you what kind of educational environment is going to best suit him as they assess for cognitive ability.  If you do go for private reports make sure that they are independent professionals ie. not employed by the health or educational service and that they have experience of being expert witnesses at educational tribunals.  The reason for this is that they will be impartial and will give a true reflection of his needs.  Someone employed by the health or education system will assess knowing what their department is able to provide - and that will be at a much lower level.  
In the UK if you have evidence of need (through professionals reports), the school has to provide that support regardless of whether they have the staffing level to do so.  If they don't the educational authority has to provide additional funding to meet that level of support.  That is why independent professionals are needed.
At the state you are at, I would have thought a paediatrician who specialises in childhood development and who has experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  Or if they don't have that experience that they can refer you to a multi disciplinary team that does have.
Once you have the diagnosis, you need to find out how your educational system works and what you will need to access certain schools.  Everyone country is different, and I don't know where you are.  If you feel you are hitting your head against a brick wall and getting no answers you can always find a legal advocate who specialises in special educational needs law and get some advice from them.  If you are in the UK you can contact the National Autistic Society as they have alot of helplines and educational advisors as well as a educational tribunal service.

        I think the key is the fact that this is a new school for your son.  Those on the spectrum have great difficulties with change in general and changes to routine.  A new school means that everything has changed.  All the teachers/pupils are different, taught in different classrooms, with a different timetable and different curriculum subjects, with different food at dinnertime, with different supports or strategies (or none at all) being used.  Infact you couldn't change his situation any more if you tried!
I presume he is in a special school?  
It maybe that he will need visual supports and a very high amount of structure and explicit teaching to help him adjust to this change in routine.  Once it is at a level where he is coping, with time, they can gradually reduce the level of support - but for now it may mean supporting him at a level that he required when he was much younger.  By that I don't mean they do everything for him.  I mean that everything is highly structured and visually presented and broken down into small manageable chunks, and that he has one key nominated worker so that the person helping him is not changing all the time.  If he is finding the new school environment difficult to cope with the school needs to look at it to make sure it is low arousal.  He might benefit from a booket with a picture of each classroom and the teacher/teaching assistants in that class.  He may need alot of extra input from the Speech Therapist to help him learn the names of his teacher and some of the pupils.  He may need alot of extra support during playtimes and dinnertimes.
From his point of view, it must be like he has just been dropped onto an alien planet.  Everything he knew at his previous school no longer applies.  He is starting from ground zero again because he doesn't have the language or social skills that we have that help us adapt to a new environment such as a change in school or workplace.
And follow the advice of the expert as above.

        There seems to be a couple of explanations.
The first one is that it is uncomfortable, even painful for them.  We don't understand that, but we just have to accept that that is how it makes them feel.
The second is that they have difficulties multi-tasking from a sensory point of view.  So, if they look at you they become focused on 'looking' and therefore don't hearing what is said to them or what is going on in the wider environment.  So they avoid making eye contact so that they actually get an understanding of what is being said.  A child like this in the classroom may get easily distracted by visual stimuli or other sensory stimuli and therefore 'miss' what is actually being taught because they cannot look, listen, write, think etc at the same time.
The third reason is down to attention and focus.  This is explained rather like wiring.  Our brains are wired up differently to theirs and we can therefore pay attention to a number of things at the same time eg. talk whilst listening and looking and being aware of what is in the wider environment.  Someone with this type of diffculty will only be able to put their attention into one thing at a time.  Therefore they may be able to talk at someone, but not be able to talk, wait and listen to the response of the other person.  If you think of social interaction rather like a tennis match with it passing between the two players like the tennis ball being hit back and forth.  Someone with attention and focus (and sensory) difficulties can either keep hitting the ball, or keep receiving the ball, but cannot do both at the same time.  Therefore information is either coming in or going out.  So in a social interaction they might talk at someone, or listen to what is being said but be unable to gather their thoughts and give a response at that time.  Avoiding eye contact helps them keep their focus as it is one less thing to be trying to do.
I have heard many times of children coming out of school having been given a message to give to their parents.  However, if they have been made to 'look at the teacher' whilst they were given the message there is a very good chance that the child will not have heard anything.
Infact most successful interaction with children or adults who have great difficulty with this is to avoid eye contact, and don't even expect them to be facing you.  When you are in the same room say their name until they acknowledge they are listening, and then 'talk to the wall'.  By talking, and not demanding their attention in the way we expect (ie. looking at us and facing us), they appear to be able to take in what is said because that is what they are concentrating on.
A woman called Olga Bogdashina has written several good books called ""Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers"", ""View From the Bridge"", (I can't remember all their names).  She gives a very good insight into how those on the spectrum 'perceive' information.  It is different to ours, and how we receive sensory information affects our perception, affects our world picture.  
Does that make any sense at all?
Google Sensory Integration Disorder as well as Auditory Processing Disorder - these conditions frequently accompany a spectrum disorder, and by reading about them you might get a better idea of the kinds of difficulties they experience.
And it also has to be remembered that these children do develop, and difficulties they have at 2 might be totally different at age 5.  My son had alot of sensory issues as a toddler.  Now he is 8 and has learnt alot of coping strategies himself.  Sensory Issues are not a major barrier for him now.  Now he is becoming more social and social interaction difficulties are causing him more problems along with his speech difficulties (he is diagnosed with Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder).  And, if his speech develops significantly, as an adult it might become harder to 'identify' that he is on the spectrum.

        There seems to be a couple of explanations.
The first one is that it is uncomfortable, even painful for them.  We don't understand that, but we just have to accept that that is how it makes them feel.
The second is that they have difficulties multi-tasking from a sensory point of view.  So,"

        My now 12 year old son was diagnosed with Asperger's approximately a year and a half ago.  I had never heard of such a thing until his teacher talked to me and shared her suspicions that he may have it.  I was very sceptical at first as well as slightly offended.  I decided to research it however.  I was astonished to see a list of signs/symptoms of Asperger's....they described my son completely.  I then took him to see a psychiatrist who confirmed the diagnosis.  He was also diagnosed with ADD.
My son is INCREDIBLY SMART and very adult-like.  He always has been.  The things that you have described sounds a great deal like my son.  I would encourage you to research Asperger's as much as possible.  There is a wealth of information online, as well as many books that are available at large bookstores.
My son has also learned a lot about Asperger's.  He's actually quite proud that he has it!  There are a lot of famous and well-respected individuals that share his same syndrome.  It actually has a lot of benefits :-)

        You can google DSM IV Aspergers for the diagnostic criteria the professionals are looking at to see if a child has enough of the behaviours to get a diagnosis.  I am a parent of a high functioning autistic and your son is showing difficulties and behaviours that are common in people with a diagnosis.
As he has sensory issues google Sensory Integration Disorder.  Also google the name Olga Bogdashina and read an article by her printed in Autism Today.
Your son also notices 'changes in the routine' eg. commenting on everyones dinner and a higher number that is usual.  Do changes in routine or expectations upset him?
When your son gets upset when the teacher yells at the whole class, he may not be able to understand or distinguish that the children is shouting at the children who have been naughty.  When my son was younger, if I told his older sister off he would go and sit on the naughty step!
Taking things literally is common.  Also concrete thinking where things can only be done in a certain way or in a certain sequence.  This can also lead to rigid behaviours or routines.
Anxiety and stress is common.  When confronted with situations they don't know how to cope with.  So he will need to be told and taught that it is okay not to know the answers, or not to understand what you have to do, and that in those situations you ask for help.  If he finds it hard to initiate conversation to ask for help, he should be given a card with a help symbol on it and he needs to be taught how to use it.  Eg. Get up and give the help symbol to the classroom teacher/assistant etc.  That should reduce the anxiety.  Try to imagine how you used to feel in school when you didn't know what to do.  That is how many of these children feel all day long.
Being clumsy etc is also down to poor balance or proprioception (these are also senses) - an Occupational Therapist should assess him - and also assess handwriting skills and motor planning skills.  This should also rule in/out dyspraxia.
Problems with smells/tastes/textures/sound/visual (eg. bright sunlight) - difficulties in these areas are due to sensory issues.  My son also does the same thing about having to open the window of the car.  If I try to stop him he says it stinks and it makes him feel sick.  If I don't allow him to open the window he will frequently vomit.
Having a limited range of interests/obsessions is typical.  So is talking about it regardless of whether the other person is even interested.  That is a social interaction difficulty.  He hasn't learnt the art of conversation or to recognise how to alter or stop his interactions depending on the response of the other person.  How does he respond to people when they interact with him?  Can he play with his peers?
Google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder to see if that is relevant.
Not having empathy is common.  However this is usually down to not understanding the situation and the implications of it, rather than not feeling.  You say your son crys when the younger sibling is hurt - so he does get that - unless it is a learnt rigid response.  Can he watch TV eg. something like 'Lassie Come Home' and understand why the boy is sad?  If so he maybe able to understanding things in some circumstances - but not be able to use that learnt information and apply it to another situation.  This is called problems with generalisation.

        The difficulties he has with speech you should mention to his Speech and Language Therapist.  Google echolalia and delayed echolalia and perseverant speech to see if any of those is what he does.  Remember it varies, some one child might do it all the time, whilst another might do it occasionally.
He is now nearly 5 and he isn't able to hold a two way conversation, preferring to talk about his interests and I presume takes no note of whether you are interested in what you are saying or whether you contribute to the conversation.  So he almost delivers a statement and doesn't 'chat' with you?  That shows a lack of awareness of other people and problems with social interaction - because in the same way that his speech is restricted to his own interests and he cannot adapt his conversation or include other people, his play skills will most likely show similar problems.
Google Executive Function Disorder as he isn't able to follow directions well and see if that sounds relevant (that is also probably tied up with his speech - I presume his speech therapist has assessed his receptive speech skills, auditory memory and working memory skills?
Does he need to keep to routines or does he get upset is something he expected doesn't happen or changes?  Is he okay with transitions ie. being told to turn off the TV to go and down something else or does he get upset when told to stop something and insist that he finishes it?
Could the holding his breath be anything to do with transitions ie. when demands are made of him he holds his breath?  My son used to vomit if I asked him to do something that was different to what he was doing at that time.
I am not a professional, I am a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum.  And the things I have mentioned I do see in my own son.  You can google the diagnostic criteria under DSM IV autism and see what the characteristics are.  
At 5 he is going to have difficulties in school with the things he is struggling with.  Is he at nursery now, and how is that going?
I think it would be advisable to go to his paediatrician or your GP and ask for a multi disciplinary team assessment of your child by professionals who have experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  If he isn't autistic he won't get a diagnosis.  And it is called the autistic spectrum because it affects every child differently from severe to mild and each child has different 'behaviours' that fit the criteria.
Screaming and throwing tantrums when frustrated and in situations of change or anxiety etc are also common amongst children on the spectrum.

        Have you looked at the diagnostic criteria for Aspergers?  You can google DSM IV Aspergers and see what the characteristics are.  It is also common for child to have bits and pieces of different disorders.  For example my son's main diagnosis is autistic spectrum disorder and he is considered high functioning because he has above average cognitive ability.  But he can also be impulsive sometimes and have problems with focus and attenton which may be down to ADD.
As those with Aspergers tend to also have Sensory Integration Disorder - google that to see if it sounds like your son.  This means any or all of his senses will be over or under senstiive.  So he may have problems with bright sunlight, noise, smells, touch, taste, balance and co-ordination.
They also tend to have difficulties with Executive Functions - google that too.
I don't know about medications.
But I do know that having the right amount of support and the right approaches/strategies at school are going to lessen any behaviours considerably.  
What is he taking the medication for?  Tantrums (known as meltdowns) are very typical of being on the spectrum - it usually happens when they are over stimulated or when there is a change or something unpredictable happens.
You are entitled to another opinion.  You can go to your GP and say that you think your son has Aspergers and ask for them to refer your son to a team of professionals that have experience in diagnosising this disorder.

        Have you looked at the diagnostic criteria for Aspergers?  You can google DSM IV Aspergers and see what the characteristics are.  It is also common for child to have bits and pieces of different disorders.  For example my son's main diagnosis is autistic spectrum disorder and he is consider"

        Home is familiar to him and he can spend his time as he chooses.  In school demands are made on him all day long and he has to comply whether he understands or not or likes it or not.
Is he in a school that specifically has experience of teaching children on the spectrum?
The more structure and routine he has the better in school.  I presume he has things like visual timetables and his work is given orally/visually/symbolically etc.  I presume his work is broken down into smaller chunks so that he can work on one section at a time and isn't expected to do things that are beyond his ability.
I presume language is kept short and simple.
I presume he has plenty of breaks and is allowed to choose things as rewards which are built into his timetable eg. he does he literacy work for 10 mins and then is allowed to do a jigsaw puzzle of his choosing (and he knows that that is going to happen because it is shown in symbols on his daily timetable.
I presume his classroom and work area is adapted to take into account any of his sensory issues.
You say he sniffs his fingers and blinks alot.  Do you think he is oversensitive visually or in his sense of smell, or do you think he is undersensitive.  What about his other senses of touch, taste, sound, balance and co-ordination.  
If any of his senses are affected what is the impact that will have in a classroom or learning environment.  
What is causing the blinking.  Are their fluorescent lights in the classroom - these can be very distracting to children on the spectrum.  Does he avoid bright sunlight?  You could have him assessed for Irlen Syndrome.  This is a visual perceptual problem.  It can range from mild to severe.  Some people have problems with things like sunlight/florescent lights - depth perception etc - others have problems with reading because the print moves on the paper.  My son is mildly affected but wearing the glasses help him cope and reduce his sensory stimulation.
Could the blinking be a tic.
I would look to his school to see if they can make his day and lessons much more predictable for him.  I would also check that he is supported during playtimes and dinnertimes and not just left to his own devices.  They can find unstructured free time very hard to deal with.  My son goes to dinnertime clubs such as lego, art, drum club etc.  He is also supported by an aide in the playground.

        Lack of eye contact is common in autistic spectrum disorders (including aspergers).  My son's eye contact is variable.  I don't think he has a uncomfortable feeling whilst looking, I think it is down to not being able to multi-task from a sensory point of view.  So when he speaks to you he is concentrating so much on what he is trying to say that he doesn't look at you.  If I make him look at me whilst I am speaking, often he cannot tell me what I have said.
Appearing deaf, not responding to name etc is also down to sensory issues.  That also happens to me and I am not on the spectrum, but I do have sensory issues and central auditory processing disorder.  When my ears are effectively turned off, my husband has to repeat my name a number of times or even touch me to make my ears begin working again.  I have no idea why it happens.
Does she have other sensory issues eg. what is she like having her hair washed/brushed/cut - or nails cut - socks and shoes put on - do tags have to be removed from clothes - does she complain of smells or tastes/textures of food - is her balance and co-ordination okay.
Did she ever repeat what you said back to you or does she use words/phrases you say or from TV/DVDs.  Does she have an unusual tone of voice or put the emphasis on the wrong part of words.  Does she pronounce words correctly.
Doe she every answer a question with something totally unrelated to the question.  Does she understand pronouns such as I, me, you, she, him, her etc.
You say she plays okay with other children her age.  Keep an eye on that.  Can she initiate play and join in with what the other children are playing.  Does she play with them or alongside them.  Can she sustain play or does she join in for a short time and then wander off, or if the other children move somewhere else to play would she go with them or stay behind? - I know she's quite young for this, but in comparison to her peers.
Children on the spectrum also have a need for routine, to have their expectations met, some have rigid repetitive behaviours.  It is very variable.  My son rarely flaps - only if watching an exciting part of a DVD and then its over in 2 seconds.  He doesn't need routine or need things to be done in a certain way.  However he does need his timetable at school, and he resists leaving the house when at home unless I tell him what the schedule is eg. you can watch TV until this programme is finished and then we have to leave to go shopping.  He likes to wrap himself up in clothes eg. even in summer he likes his coat hood up and fully fastened.  So your daughter expecting the same thing to happen when you walk through the door, or expecting you to get dressed is a rigid way of thinking and you may see it move into other aspects of daily life.  This way of thinking can also affect learning because the child is learning 'chunks' of information rather than analysing things and putting pieces together.  Eg. with the clothes, instead of using her imagination and understanding that mum has just got up and is wearing her dressing gown, she thinks immediately that you need to be properly dressed.  That approach to learning can make it difficult for them to learn concepts.  Teaching is usually giving out bits of information for the children to put that together.  Children on the spectrum can tend to work the other way around ie. they need to see the finished product and then take it to pieces to see how it works.
And 'autism' can be very subtle and you need experienced professionals who are used to diagnosing this disorder to see your daughter.  I would recommend you go back to your paediatrician and ask to be referred to a team of professionals who have expertise in diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  Your daughter is 2 now.  It will take some months (usually) to be referred.  Usually it is the Speech and Language Therapist that assesses all aspects of receptive and expressive speech as well as auditory processing and working memory and social interaction skills.  Depending on their results they recommend other professionals see the child.  In my case that took a further 6 months waiting and on top of that 18 months of observations and assessments.  My son finally got a diagnosis of high functioning autism with sensory integration disorder (he has recently been diagnosed with Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder).  He may have dyslexia and dyscalculia.  Yet he was able to put the numbers 0-10 in order from the age of 1.  But he did that because many children on the spectrum are brilliant with visual memory and pattern construction.  So he could put them in order and tell you what each number was in the line, but couldn't identify any number out of the sequence.  He is assessed as high average intelligence.  We started to have concerns around 3+ years old because he hated nursery and wouldn't join in.  But I was fobbed off until he started school - then 6 months later they called me into school with their concerns.  With hindsight I wish I had pushed for an answer earlier because all professionals agree that the earlier you start interventions, therapies and supports the better the outcome.  And you need your daughter to have those supports (if she needs them) before she starts nursery/school otherwise it will be a very stressful and negative experience for her.
I recently moved him to a school that is a mixture of mainstream children and those on the spectrum.  All the teachers and TAs have experience and expertise in teaching children with these types of difficulties.  He has shown alot of improvement.  This morning he spelt three words correctly.  He is also starting to read rather than just memorise all the words in his reading book.  
So, some of the things you mention in your post I would recognise as being on the spectrum.  Whether or not she has enough of them in all the areas required to get a diagnosis you won't know unless she is assessed.  And she is 2.  There is alot that can be done to help her learn skills.  She sounds like she is probably high functioning.  You can google DSM IV autism to see what the diagnostic criteria is.

        Lack of eye contact is common in autistic spectrum disorders (including aspergers).  My son's eye contact is variable.  I don't think he has a uncomfortable feeling whilst looking, I think it is down to not being able to multi-task from a sensory point of view.  So when he speaks to you he "

        You can google DSM IV Aspergers to read the diagnostic criteria.
Your post includes the following information that could be interpreted as being on the spectrum:
He needs routine.  Changes upset him considerably.
He needs to stick to rules rigidly and is very upset if he finds out he has broken the rules in some way.
He has alot of anxiety around social environments such as the bus, school, playdates.
He takes language literally.  He can't put it into context, or understanding teasing, or humour.
He has difficulties around social interaction and avoids them.
He obsesses about things - who said what.
He has sensory issues - he covers his ears at certain sudden unpredictable noise.

That is quite a list in your short post.  
What concerns me about your post is his level of anxiety.  Your child that doesn't have the 'freedom' of thought and response that a typical child would have becuase his understanding of language and social interaction is down to a literal interpretation of language.  And he has to stick to that rigid way to try to do things right.  I presume he gets very upset when he finds out that eventhough he tried to do/say the right thing, he still did it wrong!  That will be very confusing and frightening to him.  
I presume his language development was typical.  He didn't repeat words or phrases said by people to him or from TV.  I presume he never had difficulties with pronouns eg mixing up I, you, he, she, her etc.
Google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder and see if that sounds like your son.
Google Sensory Integration Disorder and see if that sounds relevant.
He is obviously struggling at school.  Or it might be just the transition from home to school that he struggles with and once he is there he copes better.  What does his teacher say?  He will definately find playtimes and dinnertime difficult because it is unstructured social time.  My son has an aide work with him to support him during playtimes.  He also goes to a Social Skills Club that is overseen by a Speech and Language Therapist.  He also goes to some dinnertime clubs.
Does his school have any experience of children with autism or aspergers?  Is he able to cope academically in the classroom?  Are they having to give him extra support?  Does he have tantrums or get very upset - and if he does how does the school deal with that?
My son goes to a school that is a mixture of mainstream children and those on the spectrum.  There is around 5 children per class on the spectrum.  As my son is also suspected to have dyslexia and dyscalculia he is in a class with other children who are struggling academically - yet his cognitive ability has been assessed as higher than average.  
But I cannot emphasis how important the right school is.  I moved my son to his current school.  
Your son is now 7.  It will become harder when he hits the teenage years because children can be very cruel to anyone who is different.  
If you want a diagnosis I would advise you go to your doctor and ask for a referal to professionals who have experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders including Aspergers.  I would also ask for a referal to an Occupational Therapist (for the sensory issues).  What are his other senses like: sight, sound, smell, taste, texture, touch, balance and co-ordination.  
Does he have any obsessions?  These can be anything he is very interested in.  If he does try to see if there is any kind of club that involves that type of thing.  My son is very interested in wars and fighting some he has just begun foil fencing lessons.  Usually team games are a no-no due to the social side of things and having to work as a team is something alien to them.  Try for small group or one to one stuff eg. trampoline, fishing, martial arts, rock climbing etc.  If his anxiety is such an issue also mention that to the doctor.  But it maybe that if he has a much more structured environment in a school that understands what these children need (usually alot of visual support eg. visual timetables, work given visually as well as verbally - structured playtimes etc - then his anxiety should reduce.  His anxiety is fueled by not being able to predict outcomes or understand anything other than the literal interpretation of language and rules.  Without that rigid interpretation it all appears like chaos to him and he literally doesn't know what to do.
You can also start with talking to him about things like 'everyone makes mistakes sometimes', 'we all try to be good but sometimes things can make us angry/upset but we can make things right by saying sorry'.  All these types of things will help him rectify things when he finds out he has broken a rule etc.  Does that make sense.  You need to teach him these things because he won't pick it up automatically like the rest of the children do.  For ages my son wouldn't attempt to draw/colour/write because he was so anxious about getting it wrong.  We had to explain to him for a long time that not getting it right is okay.  That people practice for a long time to get things right etc.  Now he will attempt things and he isn't so upset when things don't turn out to plan.

        I am a parent of a child on the spectrum, not a professional.
The interesting thing I saw in your post was that the SP thought he performed okay when participating in something he was interested in.  Sometimes that is how those on the spectrum are.  My son will engage and make eye contact and take turns etc if you are doing something he is interested in.  He also was assessed by a SP as having age appropriate expressive language.  I disagreed with this because I knew that my son was using alot of language he had lifted from other people/TV/DVDs etc but uses them appropriately, and he does have a good vocabularly in his areas of interest.  In the end I paid a private SP who had experience of autistic spectrum disorders as well as attending Educational Tribunals.  I told her all my concerns and she carried out extensive assessments on my son.  Her results confirmed my suspicions.  For example can your son listen to verbal instructions and carry them out; can he listen to a story and deduce information from it; does he have any Auditory Processing or Processing Delays; does he understand humour; can he multi-task from a sensory point of view eg. can he listen and look; does he ever appear deaf when you call his name.
Google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder and see if that sounds relevant to your son.  If I were you I would also want a SP with experience of speech disorders as well as speech disorders associated with autistic spectrum disorders.
Does your son socialise generally on the same level as his peers?
Does he have interests or obsessions?
Does he have any sensory issues?
Does he throw tantrums?
Does he get upset at changes in routine or doing things in a different way.
It is quite possible he is gifted.
My son had a range of percentiles ie. 93% in areas such as spatial awareness and pattern recognition against a 2% for understanding verbal instructions.  Most of his other scores were around average, but again he got much better results on other tests that were carried out which did not depend on language - however my son is High Functioning Autistic and not Aspergers.
Can you give some details about the behavioural issues?
You can also google DSM IV for the diagnostic criteria for Aspergers to see what it is.

        It is worth checking wether your grandson needs a diagnosis to get input in school from people like a Speech and Language Therapist.  These are the professionals who look at social interaction skills in the UK, if you are somewhere else check to see if it is part of their job.  He will need to be taught the difference between family, friends and strangers and taught different ways of saying hello to them.  At 6 it is not too bad - maybe just starting to look a little inappropriate - but the SALT should put together a programme for this in school.  My son goes to a Social Skills Club that is overseen by a SALT.  My son also has an adult to support him with play and social interaction during playtimes and dinnertimes.  My son is diagnosed with high functioning autisim.   I think the difficulty alot of children with 'Aspergers' have is that they are just considered too capable.  But as you see for yourself, they do not pick up social communication and behaviour automatically by interacting with other children.  They need it to be taught to them like it is a lesson and once they have learnt it in one environment eg. school they have to be taught to transfer that skills into other environments eg. home etc.
Google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder.  See if that sounds like your grandson.  If it does then maybe that as a diagnosis might be more acceptable to the family, and, as it is a speech disorder (closely associated with being on the spectrum), in the UK it means the child will have access to a SALT throughout his school years because it is a 'disorder' and therefore will be with the child for life.
You can also find out about Social Stories.  This is a way of giving information to children.  His school or an Educational Psychologist should be able to show you how these work.
You could also consider Play Therapy, but you would need to find a PT who has experience of working with children on the spectrum and who uses a system similar to Greenspan floor time where she will get down with the child (and eventually introduce other children) and can model back behaviour and talk through emotions and thought processes of social interaction and playing as it is happening.
There are also games you can buy about these types of issues.  I know my son's school has some, but I don't know where they got them from.  So there would be a scenario and the child has to pick a card that is an appropriate reaction or behaviour to the scenario and also explain their reasoning for choosing that card.
If you are in the USA contact a national autism organisation and ask them to put you in the right direction.
You can also find out about local support groups.  It might be helpful for all the family to meet other families in similar situations especially if they do social stuff together so that their children and siblings can meet and play together.
Does your grandson have any awareness that he doesn't do things or react as his peers do?  Keep an eye out for that, although he has no diagnosis, he may need his difficulties explaining to him so that he doesn't start to get a negative image of himself.  Knowing that their is a reason can be positive because otherwise the child will label themselves as being stupid or weird.  And whether or not a child is diagnosed they will get labeled by those they come into contact with because they do stick out because of their behaviours or language or sensory issues etc.  There are many strengths and positives to being on the spectrum which are also worth knowing about as well.

Thanks for the reply I have to say reading through your post yes is the answer to a lot of what you have listed.  to respond, no sharing is a no no at the moment but it is improving and taking turns is hard work for him to comply with but again is improving.  in relation to playing with toys he mainly plays with his cars.  He likes the movement of the wheels and can notice if the wheels do not move in unison, you know the way you have cheap cars where the bar is thin the wheels move up and down as well as around and he will keep telling you that it is broken.  he doesnt spin or flap.  He does chat, actually he yaps all the time.  Yes to the question of do you talk and he appears not to understand a lot of the time he will do that and repeat back what he last said to you as opposed to what you asked him.  he doesnt like change and is very particular about his clothing as in if there is a string hanging off anything you have to cut it off, the seam on his socks has to go across his toes.  his coat must be zipped up or buttons closed.  His balance is not great he is very cautious when he moves but coordination wise he's not bad.  His hearing seems fine and yes he does feel pain.  based on this what do you think???

        I am a parent of a 7 year old high functioning autistic child and I would disagree with the expert when she says the repeating of dialogue is inappropriate for the situation.  That is not true.  Indeed the higher the cognitive level of the child the more appropriate it is and in some circumstances it can fool professionals into thinking that they have advanced verbal skills.  An experienced Speech and Language Therapist who has experience of autistic spectrum disorders as well as speech impairments should be able to assess his speech and communication and social interaction skills.
Out of interest, also google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder to see if that is relevant.
Other indications are speaking with an accent.  For example my son is English but speaks with an American accent.  Also strange voice intonation or inflextion or emphasis or how words are pronounced. 
Echolalia is also an indication of a top down learning style rather than a bottom up learning style.  It means they learn things whole or in chunks rather than putting pieces of information together and analysing it.  If that is the case then his school work needs to be differentiated to take this different learning style into account.

        I would want a second opinion.  I would go back to your GP/Paediatrician and tell them you want referring to a multi-disciplinary team that has experience of diagnosing autism and aspergers.  Have you googled DSM IV Aspergers/Autism/PDD NOS to get the clinical criteria the professionals are looking for?  As you will see any child only has to get some of the behaviours in the areas mentioned.  I would then begin making a daily diary of behaviours he shows that meets the criteria.
When my son was being assessed he was seen at home and school on a number of occasions by various professionals for the very reason that these children do tend to behave differently in different environments.  We were also asked to video him at home for them to look at.
I think you need to be referred to a centre that has deals exclusively with speech and communication disorders such as those on the autistic spectrum.  Other professionls simply dont always see the autism in the behaviours and it leaves the parents with no answers.  
Of course it maybe that your son does have a mixture of ASD and ADHD.  But again it takes time and numerous observations to make that decision.  It took over 18 months for my son to get a diagnosis and he was seen by around 5 professionals and each one saw him at least twice.

        Go onto the Autism forum and click on the Health Page icon on the top right hand corner of the page.  Click on ""Bhavioural Characteristics Behind a Diagnosis of Autism (ASDs).  I am a parent of a 7 year old child on the spectrum.  I have posted the DSM IV criteria for getting a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder, and parents have posted examples of their child's behaviour that meets the criteria.  That might help you recognise your own son in those behaviours.  You will see that any child only has to have a certain amount of the characteristics out of each section.  So no child will have all of the characteristics and every child will be different.
Regarding repeating questions, words etc - google Echolalia and Autism and also Perseverant Speech and Autism and see if that sounds like what he is doing.  If it is then he probably has a speech disorder that needs to be assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist.  She should assess his expressive and receptive speech as well as assess for Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder.  Difficulties with language and communication can cause many behavioural problems because they are struggling with something we do so naturally.
Also google Sensory Integration Disorder to see if that sounds relevant.  Is your son over or under sensitive in any of his senses?
Sometimes not caring about consequences is really that they cannot see the consequences of their actions - there is a difference.  Problems with predicting outcomes can be associated with poor Theory of Mind - google that to see if it is relevant.  If it is then poor TOM is associated with autistic spectrum disorders, as are the above disorders mentioned.
Tantrums, getting violent, very emotional, sudden outbursts etc are also typical of autistic spectrum disorders.  If there is a lack of control of emotions then triggers can cause them to be totally overwhelmed with emotions that they cannot stop or bring under control.  Alot of work has to be done to get your son to recognise his emotional state and to teach him appropriate ways of calming down and coping strategies.  Again a Speech and Language Therapist and Educational Psychologist should be working with you on this.  
If you have a gut feeling that there is something else, then that may well be the case.  My son has an ASD and I suspect he also has aspects of ADD.  All of my other gut feelings relating to his speech problems, dyslexia, visual problems etc have all turned out to be true.  
So look into the above mentioned disorders, as having any one of them will lead to enormous amounts of frustration and behavioural difficulties.  And then go to your GP and say although my son has a diagnosis of ADHD I believe he also has XXXX and I want him referred to professionals who have experience of diagnosing this disorder.
What is your son like off meds?  If taking them makes him worse, and there is no noticeable benefit to him being on meds, then I would speak with his GP about gradually weaning him off them for a time to see how he is.
As you probably know, disorders such as ADHD or ADS can also have anxiety and depression/bi-polar with them as well, so you will need to keep a very close eye on him when he is coming off meds.
Regarding meds, many people on the spectrum have posted saying that normal doses of medications can be too powerful for them.  So when trying anything new it might be worth discussions starting on a very very low dose and gradually increase over time if it is beneficial.
As he is verbal what is his reason for wanting to hurt himself and others?

        You don't say how old the student is.
If she was toilet trained up until 3 years ago, something must have happened for her to regress.  It might have been to do with generalisation.  Those with autism can learn how to do things in one environment, with the same person, with the same prompts.  But if the environment, person or prompts change then they don't recognise the situation as being the same.  So, for example, a child may learn to tie their shoelaces at home, but be unable to do the same task at school.  
However she is now in the routine of wearing diapers.  But I would suggest that however you approach it that she first learns the process explicitly with one person and that once it is learnt that it is slowly generalised out to other people or prompts or environments otherwise she could easily lose the skill again.
Is there any reason to suspect her medications (if any), could be behind this?
Does she have sensory issues?  Could she becoming too stimulated or too focused on something that she doesn't recognise the need for the toilet?

        My son is suspected of Asperger's and we're going through the diagnosis right now so different from your son. However he has the sensory issues and this was one of them when he was that age. 
Here's what I did:
Daily I used to let him play naked with his favourite toy (animals) in an empty bath. Then after a few weeks we let the water trickle in. Eventually he would have a bath if he went in naked first, empty with the water then turned on slowly. He was then screaming if the water ran too fast or if I showered him so once he was comfortable in the bath daily for a few weeks I would run a shower into it for a short time, extending the period and eventually filling up the bath that way instead of with the taps. The water from the shower falling on the bath water fascinated him and he was calm.

It took me well over a year but it paid off. He is now 8 and will have a bath although he is anxious before he gets in and often climbs in before I run the tap. He now has a shower every morning and he doesn't actually wash but the water just hits his back and it's on the trickle setting not a power shower, he can't do it any other way.

I'm hoping that by the time he is a teen he will be able to wash properly but what was a distressing time for him and for me is now part of his routine and push him a tiny bit further every now and then, today it was shower gel. I found that he couldn't use a wash cloth but my hand instead, probably less irritating.

My son could communicate although not when he was this distressed but I know you have a more difficult task at hand. I hope this helps, hang in there.

        Those on the spectrum think in a very literal black and white way.  If he does something he knows is naughty he will feel bad about it because he knows it was wrong.  He may also feel guilty if he is impulsive because he couldn't control himself or stop himself doing something he knew he shouldn't.  He may then obsess about what he has done and he may also literally believe that 'we have to tell the truth'.  He won't understand about white lies, or not telling so you don't get into trouble.  He will believe that once he has done wrong he needs to tell someone to pass over the responsibility and let go of the guilt.  Is he telling about things he has been naughty or impulsive about, or is he telling about other things as well.  My son went through a phase that even when his sister had been naught, if she had to go to timeout he wanted to go to time out too because 'something naughty had happened'.  It took him a long time to understand that time out was only for the person who did the naughty thing.
The fact that he knows when he has done something he shouldn't is very positive because it shows a high level of self awareness.  However you need to keep an eye on this because he will understand he is different and that he has difficulties and that could lead to low self esteem and even depression.  Try to get him involved in any clubs or activities that is around his interests or obsessions to keep him occupied and motivated. You may also need to explain to your son that 'everyone does things wrong sometimes'.  You may also need to explain to him that some people tell lies etc.  If he believes everything that is said to him he maybe gullable and his peers may get him to do things that get him into trouble at school.
He may also have difficulties letting go of feelings.  If my son gets upset he says he cannot control the emotions or stop them.  So he can be upset, angry for long periods of time.  Even when he has recovered, if he remembers what happened, he will again become upset or angry.  At school they will need to work on emotions so that he recognises these emotions in himself and in others and he will need to be taught how to cope with emotions.  All these things will need to be taught explicitly because they wont come naturally to him.

        Your doctor should be able to refer you to a multi disciplinary team that specialises in autistic spectrum disorders such as autism/aspergers etc.  They should be able to assess you and give you some insight into your condition.  You really need help to find out what your strengths and weaknesses are.  Do you have difficulties with social interaction for example?
As you mention colour linking into number associations etc it might be worth you googling synesthia to see if that sounds like what is happening to you.  This is when sensory information can get mixed up and associated with other senses.  For example you talk about numbers being related to colours.  Other people might have colours that relate to smells.  It might be that you have synesthesia and some autistic traits, but not enough for a diagnosis.  
I am not a doctor, I am a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum.  But I think you are right to be looking for answers to your experiences.

        Is your son verbal?  If so, ask him does it hurt down there.  My son, and many other autistic children, do not volunteer information even when they are in pain.  You need to ask the specific question 'is it hurting you' and then he might reply 'yes'.  I have many examples of this, but the most recent was when one side of my sons face swelled up and I took him to the doctors.  He had a bad ear infection.  When I asked my son 'does your ear hurt you', he said 'yes I can't get to sleep at night'.  But he must have had that infection for a long time and hadn't uttered a word about being in pain to anyone.
I would also recommend you to go your GP and have his urine tested for any infection and his penus swobbed for thrush.  Depending on those results the GP will prescribe something.
Is he drinking plenty of fluids?
Is there anything else you can think of that could be causing this, or why he might be doing this?  Is his sensory system over sensitive, or under sensitive or does it fluctuate between the two?

        It must be very frustrating, but this type of problem is very common - if that helps!!!
As he seems to have a routine of going before bedtime, could you work with that and get him on a potty he is comfortable with.  My son hated being looked at, so maybe if you stayed in the room with your back to him?
Does he have difficulties keeping his clothes, shoes or socks on?  If he does then he maybe tactile sensitive and certain types of sensation/fabrics may irritate and hurt him hence the continual removal of the offending item.  I am over sensitive to touch (but am not autistic), and I have a 7 year old son on the spectrum.  I cannot bear anything next to my skin apart from cotton.  No manmade fibres, and definately no wool or lace.  Tags also  have to be removed.  If I don't remove a tag it initially irriates, but after about 1 minute the sensation has turned to a stabbing pain (like being pricked by a thorn).  
I just mention these things incase there is a sensory explanation behind it.
Do you think your son can actually feel when he needs to go to the toilet?  Some people with autism find it hard to recognise internal sensations like this.  If he can recognise it, then would it be possible to teach him to use the 'toilet' PECS symbol to show you when he needs the toilet, so that you are ready for it?  Although my son is verbal he has some PECS symbols clipped onto his trousers with something that looks like a plastic coil spring.  If he cannot 'say' what he needs or wants, he can go to an adult and show them the picture.
If he really doesn't like to 'sit' on the potty, there are some inflatable toilet seats you can buy.  Or you could teach him to crouch over the potty, but not sit on it.
Is your son verbal?  Can you explain things to him and he understands?  If so you could show him why we use the toilet and what happens to the poop afterwards.  I know these types of videos are available, but I don't know where you get them from.  Some children find it useful to visually see the whole process before they know what they need to do.

        Playing with parts of toys and especially spinning wheels etc is characteristic of being on the autistic spectrum, but obviously there is alot more to a diagnosis than that.  Also many children on the spectrum want and try to be social but don't really know how to do it as they either lack the language or social skills to be successful.  Some autistic children like alot of noise and visual distractions which can appear as if they like to socialise, when it is really the sensory stimulos of the social environment that they enjoy.
If you have concerns, the only way to address that is for your son to be assessed.  If he is on the autistic spectrum the earlier interventions begin the better the prognosis.

        For a child to be on the autistic spectrum they have to have enough characteristics in each area to get a diagnosis.  So a child would be observed and assessed by professionals such as a Speech and Language Therapist, Educational/Clinical Psychologist, Occupational Therapist, Clinical Paediatrician etc.
The areas of difficulty (usually called the triad of impairments), is (a) speech (any language delays or disorders), (b) social interaction (problems with interacting with peers, appears to not know how to play or join in), and (c) rigid repeitive behaviours, lack of imagination, need for routines etc (this can show itself in demanding things are always done in the same way, throwing tantrums at changes in routine, not appearing to have flexibility of thought etc).
If your grandson has these types of difficulties then please post again.  If he doesn't it is possible to have some traits of autism, but not enough to get a full diagnosis.
The part of your post I recognise as 'possible' (ie. I notice in my own son), is the detail orientated and the need for things to happen as he wants them to.  
What is his interaction like with his peers?
Does he have any sensory issues eg. appears over or under sensitive.  For example a child might cover their ears at certain noise and then appear deaf when someone calls their name.  Does he complain that soft touch hurts him and then appears not to feel pain if he hurts himself.  Is he sensitive to smells, tastes, textures of food.  Can he wear clothes with tags in?
Is it just the flapping that is concerning you?
Do you feel that his need to adhere to 'his plans' cause difficulties with family arrangements or playing with his peers?

        I am not a professional, I am a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum.  My son hardly flaps at all.  It is only if he gets very excited for example watching a DVD and it is at the most exciting part of the film and then he might bounce up and down on the sofa and flap his hands.  Or he might do it if he got extremely frustrated.  So flapping is not a big issue with my son eventhough he is on the spectrum.  He used to spin when he was a toddler and he still regulates his sensory system by using movement.
Have you looked at the DSM IV criteria for aspergers/autistic spectrum disorders?
To get a diagnosis your child has to get a certain level of the characteristics out of each section.  You may find your son doesn't have enough of them or in all sections to get a diagnosis.
But if you look at the DSM IV criteria you will see that they fall in sections eg. speech and communication, social interaction, imagination/rigid routines/obsessions etc.  Are you happy that your son does not have any difficulties in these areas?  Sometimes it is hard to see the difficulties, especially at that age.  For example my son also likes to play with other children, but as he has grown (he is now 7+), it became clear that although he wanted to play he found it difficult to join in imaginary games or to alter his role within a game.  He tends to want to play rigidly usually relating to things he has seen on TV (and all children do that to some extent).  So I was told that although he does want to play his social interaction is compromised because of his 'quality' of play. 
You have posted about the hand flapping.  My understanding is that this is mainly a sensory issue.  Does your son have any other sensory behaviour eg. what is his response to sound, touch, taste, smell, visual stimulus?  Also what is his balance and co-ordination like.  Does he ever fluctuate with perception eg. appear deaf sometimes and then complain of noise or cover his ears at other times.  Is he fussy about clothes/shoes/socks and having tags removed and yet at other times appears not to feel pain?  Does he complain about tastes/textures of food or about smells?
You don't mention having tantrums, especially around change of routine or expectations, so I presume that isn't a problem.  Is he okay with transitions eg. having to stop doing something to move onto something else, or would he get upset and insist that he finishes what he is doing?
Have a look at Sensory Integration Disorder and see if that sounds relevant?
But the only way to know for sure is for your son to be assessed by a multi disciplinary team that has experience of autism and aspergers.  This will involve them talking with you, his nursery, and also observing him to see his behaviours and also assessing him to see what his abilities are.  This usually involves a Speech and Language Therapist to assess receptive and expressive language as well as semantics/pragmatics of language, a Clinical Psychologist, Clinical Paediatrician and maybe a Neurologist and Occupational Therapist.  These assessments can take some time from a referal point of view and then assessments are carried out over a period of time.  From the age of 3 I began to have concerns with my son, and when he started school they called me in because of the avoidance behaviours he was showing.  The assessment process started when he was 4+ years old and it is only now at 7+ years old that he is in the right educational environment (still mainstream), and professionals are BEGINNING to put programmes of therapy into place.  So that took 3+ years!  So, if you do have any real concerns I would say start the process of assessments, because if he isn't on the spectrum he won't get a diagnosis, but if he is on the spectrum you need those supports and therapies in place asap.

        thanks for your insight I have tried to get him into other things they stick for a little while but the zelda  seems  to be his main focus no matter how i try to encourage him to get interested in other things plus i tried to get him to play soft ball but he did not care for it at all. my husband family thinks i'm over reacting to my son's  obession of zelda  and thinks he a normal kid ( i want him to be normal to but when health professional says they feel they his behavior is odd and to get him tested I just think we should listen to their advice.) I have tried to explain to his family about our son's odd behavior and all they say is he all right your just looking for problems but i'm not. I try really hard to set up play dates too but they always seem not to work cause of personality clashes he some times has with kids his own age they just dont seem to understand where he is coming from , and i have to explain it.

but I also hear this alot to he is an only child and that is why he acts the way he does but i know other only kids and they dont act this way and i work really hard to keep involed in actives, I'm always finding events to take him to meet other kids, he is involed at his church he goes wed. and sun. they just make me feel that i dont try hard enough but i know i do. sorry dont mean to vent.
I always have to keep him happy it seems just the smallest things upset him like today I took him to his asthma doc. cause he had a bad cough and the doc told him that he had a virus and he started to cry and the list can go on , i always feel like a cheerleader lol

        Google DSM IV and look at the diagnostic criteria for Aspergers.  You have to have difficulties in all the areas mentioned to get a diagnosis.
I would also consider whether a formal diagnosis will be a positive thing for you.  Try to find out if it will affect your insurance premiums etc, or it may give you access to certain benefits you don't currently qualify for.
As well as difficulties with social interaction those on the spectrum usually have difficulties with language and may take things very literally and not understand certain types of humour such as sarcasm.  With Aspergers there is also usually interests and obsessions that are not usually typical.  There is also alot of anxiety as well as difficulties with 'theory of mind' and imagination or predicting outcomes etc.
As you are interested and willing to improve your social skills there is every chance that you will be successful.  But that may mean that you have to rote learn a mental list/procedure to go through to try to help you at times when things are not obvious to you.  
If you think a diagnosis would be useful to you, then you could talk with the professionals involved with your children and tell them you think that you too may be on the spectrum and would like to be assessed and ask them how you would go about it in your area.  
It maybe that you have some traits, but not enough to get a formal diagnosis.  I have some sensory issues, auditory processing problems and tend to be quite solitary - although I can enjoy myself in large social settings if I'm in the mood for it.  I think it is quite common for traits of autism/aspergers to be in family members when there is a child with a full diagnosis.
But, although you may struggle with some things, you are in an ideal position to understand how your children are perceiving things and what kinds of supports would be helpful.  
I think it is brilliant that more and more adults on the spectrum are beginning to work in schools/adult employment to help others understand what is behind the difficulties.  And as well as causing you some difficulties, autism/aspergers also has some very positive aspects to it eg. total concentration and endurance in areas of interest, original approaches to problem solving etc.  
If you don't think a formal diagnosis would be helpful, it might still be useful when seeking help or advice about your anxiety/panic attacks to mention that you have children on the spectrum and think you might have aspects of it as well.  That should help professionals give you a more suitable approach to helping you with your difficulties as the basis of them may be completely different from other people who are not on the spectrum.

        The only way that your son will get a diagnosis is if he is assessed and observed by a multi disciplinary team who have experience and expertise in diagnosing autism and aspergers.  You should go to your doctor and request he refers you to the relevant professionals or clinic.  Your son will need to have enough characteristics out of each section for him to get a diagnosis.  Google DSM IV for Aspergers and see what the criteria is.  However, as you mention you cannot understand what he is saying, that sounds more like autism as those with Aspergers have normal language development - so google DSM IV for autism as well.
I don't think the things you mention are down to behaviour because you say he is uncoordinated, and that he seems unable to follow simple verbal instructions and that you cannot understand what he is saying to you.  They all indicate a problem, not behaviour, although frustration at not being able to communicate or get his needs met may lead to frustration and behavioural issues.
He needs to be assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist for his language and social interaction skills and an Occupational Therapist to assess his balance/coordination and other sensory functions.
When you see the doctor also mention that he doesn't seem interested in interacting with his peers, that you cannot understand what he is saying to you and that he cannot tolerate changes to his routine and say that you suspect he maybe on the autistic spectrum.
You need to start this process because if you cannot understand him and he is 4, he is going to have alot of difficulties when he starts school, and everyone needs to know what his strengths and weaknesses are prior to school so that supports are in place by then.

Unless you see any regression in your son - let them be friends. 

Provide some interaction opportunities - other than video games - offer them activities. Try to play sports with them. 

I always made friends with unpopular children - I felt bad about them being bullied by ""popular children""........I helped them to study and socialize, as I was fairly popular and straight ""A"" student, but the person who got the most of these relationships is me.

Try to talk to your son for starters - it maybe that he is introverted by nature and does not mix well with all the jocks.

        I think the only way to find out for sure is to have him assessed by a speech and language therapist.  I think that hearing different languages can sometimes make them later to start talking (but having said that my daughter was bi-lingual from 9 months onwards).  My son was only saying 2 word combinations at 2+ years and he began repeating words and phrases he heard people say or from the TV.  He went on to get a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder.  I am not suggesting that that is definately what it is, but you have your concerns, and if this boy is on the spectrum then the sooner he receives input from professionals the better the outcome.
I would also like to point out that being on the autistic spectrum does not mean a child cannot hug, kiss or show affection.  Those on the milder end are able to do this to varying degress (along with show imagination and have some theory of mind), although they may have other social interaction difficulties.

        I am a parent of a child (age 7-8) who has high functioning autism.  I am not a professional.  Your son does have some typical characteristics of Aspergers.
And he is having such difficulties with social interaction I can understand why you are homeschooling him.  However, social interaction is part of the Speech and Language Therapists responsibility.  She should be putting together a programme to improve his social skills because unfortunately he will not be able to remove himself from the world and he will need to interact with other people.
Please don't think i'm being judgemental, because I am not.  But when you are no longer around the professionals who will have contact with him will need to know exactly what his disorder is, otherwise they may think he is being awkward, or spoilt or rude, when infact it is Aspergers.  
My son also finds social interaction difficult.  He simply does not know what to do or say.  They have to be taught specific rote learnt phrases to help them initiate conversation, and they have to be taught to time themselves and stop talking after a number of minutes to let the other person speak.  They also have to be taught to listen to what the other person says!  And this is just one thing that we think is so simple, just having a chat with someone.  He has to learn everything.
My son is in a mainstream school, but it also has experience and expertise in autism.  He goes to dinner time clubs and is supported in his play by it being structured eg. he chooses what activitiy to do at play time and he choose who he will do it with and a Teaching Assistant keeps an eye on proceedings.  
I am going to an Educational Tribunal at the end of January 2009 to get the provision in school that my son needs.  I have had private reports from an Occupational Therapist, Speech and Language Therapist and Educational Psychologist.  Some of the things I have asked for have already been agreed.  My son will get a greater level of support that any other child in that school.  Unfortunately everything is down to budgets.  The more 'needs' your child has the more it costs the educational system.  However there are educational laws that state that your son's 'needs' must be met.
If I were homeschooling my son I would still want input from a Speech and Language Therapist about how to improve his social skills.
Regarding Sensory stuff.  I found a book by Olga Bogdashina called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers very useful.  She has a daughter with aspergers and a son with autism.  This book helped me reduce my sons sensory behaviour because it showed me 'what' he was experiencing.  There is a questionnaire at the back of the book that you can complete to get a sensory profile.  This questionnaire is reputable as the autism outreach department in my city uses it.  You may find that there are other senses also affected and that is causing additional stress on his sense of smell and taste/texture.  If those other senses are helped, then it may lesson the oversensitivity on the other senses.  Google Irlen Syndrome as alot of those on the autistic spectrum can have this visual perceptual problem.  My son wears the glasses for sensitivity to sunlight and depth perception.  It has helped reduce his auditory sensitivity.
Would your son consider tasting things on the promise that he doesn't have to swallow them?
Do you think it is the taste or the texture of the food that is the problem.
Does your son also have oversensitive smell?
If he is refusing food because it is a rigid way of thinking then you need to teach him the idea of 'change' or 'surprise'.  An Educational Psychologist/SALT should be able to show you how to do this.  This helps them realise that 'change' is not always bad.  They stick rigidly to things because their sensory world changes constantly and they cannot predict outcomes.  If noise hurts your ears one day, but not the next you will automatically begin to avoid noise 'incase' it hurts you.  And that way of thinking may apply to all his sensory systems.  It took my son a while to accept that 'chicken nuggets' are the same as 'chicken chunks' are the same as 'pieces of fried chicken with breadcrumbs'.  Prior to that he would tantrum if a word changed.  Now he is better - not perfect - but alot better with change. 
Regarding getting a diagnosis.  Is it going to be beneficial to your son or in getting the supports and provisions he needs?  If it will help then it might be worth getting it.
Regarding narrow interests.  That is how they are.  However you can teach them many things through their interests.  There is no point trying to make them interested insomething they aren't interested in.  They just won't have any attention or focus for it.  It might be an idea to try and extend his interests to make the box bigger.  For example if he likes trains you might get him interested in the cities that the trains visit, and then move it to cities around the world etc etc.

        If any child has allergies or food intolerances then removing them from the diet should make them feel better.  If you feel better you are more likely to cope with things that would normally upset you or overwhelm you.  Children with autism tend to communicate their feelings through behaviours rather than language, so it is obvious that their behaviours may improve if they feel better.  There is alot of debate about food intolerances.  
However, autism is not due to allergies or intolerances, although some parents do report some improvements with diet changes.  Many other parents, including myself, don't have improvements.  I do have food intolerances and I do have improvements when I remove those foods.
Autism is neurological.  That means it is part of 'who' they are.  It is how they are wired up.  It is chemical reactions (and we are all made up of chemical reactions).  
Children with autism can sometimes have very restricted diets, so removing something from their diet should really be checked with a nutricianist to make sure their diet is still balanced.
I found more improvement in my son's autistic behaviours by moving him to a school that had experience of teaching children on the autistic spectrum.  Addressing his sensory needs (google sensory integration disorder and also Olga Bogdashina and read an article by her in autism today).  Getting the right support in school by having a private Speech and Language Therapist assess all areas of his speech and social interaction so that school knew exactly what kind of supports would help him.  
There are lots of things that will help your son grow and develop.  And there are also alot of treatments out there that have no validation at all.  
So if you want to try it and see if there is an improvement okay.  Casein leaves the system quicker than glutein.  So it might be easier to remove diary foods first and if there is no noticeable improvement in a couple of months put him back onto diary.  Then a couple of months after that remove glutein.  I think you need much longer to see if glutein is having any affect.
Always make sure you go to reputable/qualified and registered doctors and professionals.

        Google DSM IV and look at the diagnostic criteria for autism and aspergers.  There isn't a huge amount of difference and it can be even harder to fit the diagnosis to a child/adult because there can be alot of borderline charteristics that fit both diagnosis.  But generally those with Aspergers tend to develop language normally.  However every parent I know with a child with a diagnosis of Aspergers says that they still have huge problems with language and social interaction.  They tend to have language processing problems, Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder, Literal interpretation of language etc.  Those with Aspergers tend (but not always), to do better ie average to above average academically.  They also tend to have obsessions and interests.
Those with autism tend to have much greater difficulty with language and tend not to develop language at the usual age.  They may not be verbal at all or may be delayed or have disordered speech.  My son is HFA and is verbal, but is also echolalic (again both those with autism and aspergers can be echolalic, which is an indication of their language difficulties because this demonstrates they don't learn language in the same way that we do.)  They also tend not to have obsessions in the same way or extent as those with aspergers.
Many would say that aspergers is on the autistic spectrum with severely autistic children being at one end and HFA and aspergers at the other.
Both groups have difficulties with change in general, changes in routine or expectations not being met.  Both groups of sensory difficulties.

        From my experience, and speaking with other parents, I have come to the conclusion that once you have a diagnosis it is extremely difficult to get anyone interested in assessing for anything else.  They tend to use phrases like 'children with ADHD tend to have these types of difficulties'.  But, as you say, that doesn't help you or your son.  As you probably know already every child with any diagnosis is different.  No two children with ADHD will be the same, and neither are any two children with autism/aspergers.  It is very common for children to have traits of both (and other) disorders.
As he is sound sensitive I would suggest you google Sensory Integration Disorder.  This should be assessed by an Occupational Therapist.  They can then put together a sensory diet to help reduce sensitivities.  I sould a book by Olga Bogdashina called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers very useful because it also explained alot of the behaviours.  For example his 'appearing deaf' is probably not down to any hearing loss.  It is because when he is focused on something else his 'hearing' effectively shuts down.  Or as his hearing can be hypersensitive at times the only way he can control that is to block out all sound.  He may/maynot do that intentionally, and his ability to tolerate different sounds and quantities of different sound sources will vary throughout the day and day to day.  But hearing is just one of the senses.  The rest are sight, smell, taste, touch, balance and co-ordination.  They may all be affected.  The book I mentioned has a sensory profile questionnaire at the back which our autism outreach department uses to get a sensory profile of each child.  You can also google Olgas name and read articles by her printed in Autism Today.
If he has Sensory Integration Disorder, it might also be worth screening him for Irlen Syndrome.  This is a visual perceptual problem that many with autism and dyslexia have.  It is corrected just by wearing glasses with tinted lenses.  
Concepts such as team games will be difficult for him to grasp if he also has autistic traits.  My son cannot play football.  
You can also google Executive Function Disorder, to see if any of that sounds relevant.
My son also has difficulties with Auditory Processing Disorder and Auditory Memory.  A Speech and Language Therapist should assess for this as well as Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder.
The SALT and an EP can assess for Dyslexia.  He may need access to a special teacher using multi sensory learning to help with those concepts.
The OT should also access his hand writing skills as it may be a motor co-ordination problem or a motor planning problem.
I find it is always helpful to put my concerns in writing and to get written replies.  That is your evidence if you ever have to go to an educational tribunal about your son's education.
The reluctance to assess is also down to budgets.  If they assess and find that your son has other needs, then they have to provide the supports in school to meet those needs.  That costs money.  I would go to the doctor/paediatrician and tell them your concerns and ask that you want him to be assessed by a multi disciplinary team that have experience of diagnosing autism because of the reasons stated above.  I would also ask for him to be referred to Occupational Therapy because you suspect he has Sensory Integration Disorder.
When you know who will be assessing your child, write them a letter with your concerns and list all the above disorders that you want him assessed for that you think may be part of his difficulties.
If that fails, get a private report done.  There are laws (find out what they are in your State) about how the school is legally bound to meet the needs of children with special educational needs.

        From my experience, and speaking with other parents, I have come to the conclusion that once you have a diagnosis it is extremely difficult to get anyone interested in assessing for anything else.  They tend to use phrases like 'children with ADHD tend to have these types of difficulties'. "

        You need to go to your doctor and ask for a referal to professionals that are experienced in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders including Aspergers.
The first professional to assess a child is usually the Speech and Language Therapist.  Your child does sound like they are having problems with language development.
He also sounds like he has sensory issues which maybe Sensory Integration Disorder.  This can affect any or all of the senses eg. vision, sound, touch, taste, smell, balance and co-ordination.  This maybe responsible for the difficulties you have mentioned of rocking constantly, tactile and auditory issues (covering his ears), bright lights, only eat dry foods etc etc.  
As he has these sensory difficulties it might also be worth googling Irlen Syndrome and seeing if that is relevant to your son.  It can be helped enormously just by wearing tinted lenses in glasses.  It is a recognised condition that affects a considerable amount of autistic and dyslexic children/adults.
An Occupational Therapist should assess for sensory difficulties and they should have experience of SID as well as autistim.  Your doctor should refer you to an OT.
Your child will also usually be seen by a clinical paediatrician and clinical psychologist.
You might also want to google Carl Delacato and Olga Bogdashina for more information about sensory differences and how they affect behaviour and perception.
Is his violence around changes in routines or expectations or with being expected to take turns or share things.  What is he like with transitions ie. having to turn off the TV or computer or being asked to do something.
You can also google DSM IV (this is the diagnostic criteria for autism/aspergers).  Look at the criteria for autism and aspergers, make notes about how it seems relevant to your son (do the same for Sensory Integratiion Disorder) and go and see your doctor again.

        She may/may not be on the spectrum, only assessments and observations can decide that.  
If she is repeating things said to her, or is repeating things from TV/DVDs etc whether it is words or songs or sounds then she might be echolalic.  Google echolalia and autism and see if that sounds similar.
Covering her ears at sound could be Sensory Integration Disorder.  Many, if not all, individuals on the autistic spectrum have sensory differences which range from mild to severe (quote by Temple Grandin).  An Occupational Therapist should assess for this and put together a programme.
The sooner any therapies are started the better the outcome.
Rather than bringing up 'autism' would it be possible to mention echolalia or sensory integration disorder as something you came across whilst on the internet and thought it reminded you of this child?  It is a very difficult subject, and it does depend on how close you are to your 'friend'.  Has the child been for regular check-ups with the paediatrician to make sure she is meeting her developmental milestones?
Usually the first professional to assess any child is the Speech and Language Therapist because most of these children have difficulties with speech and social interaction.  If her speech is poor then that could be an avenue you could bring up because all children need sufficient communication and language skills for nursery and school otherwise they won't be able to communicate or understand what is being asked of them.

        Hello Rachel,
        In response to your answer, There is no internet or any other games in his bedroom. Never has been.  He does play it in the living room with family members around. Sometimes he sneaks to the living room during the night. We have tried board games where there is interaction with others but this doesn't last long. He has shown interest in wanting to study Astronomy,earth sciences, or genetics, We have encouraged using the internet to read about these topics instead playing the games. We have also gone to the library for information on the same but he gets other books that are fiction.He even thought Walt Disney World was boring.
He does not mix well with others, He is more of a loner, nosies upset him.He is very strong minded. His social skills are lacking. If he feels anyone is wrong in any conversation he hears he promptly correct you. When he was in the school system he would correct any teacher that he thought was making  an error.
He was tested in first grade & results were astounding. His math at age 6 was of a 16 year old. School subjects at this present time are beyond high school level, but not doing well because they are boring.
His IQ is so high he can accomplish anything if we could just get him interested in a subject. To force him just makes him more angry.

        The first step would be to go to your GP and ask for a multi disciplinary team assessment by professionals who have experience of diagnosising autism and aspergers.  The first professional to go in is usually the Speech and Language Therapist.  Alot of the difficulties you have mentioned could be down to communication and speech disorders.
It is totally unacceptable that the teacher refused to work with you on your son's difficulties.  She is being more 'autistic' then your son!!!
If you feel that this school is not able to deal with his very real difficulties that are not down to him being spoilt, naughty, or rude, then it might be better to look for another school that does have other pupils on the spectrum and which has experience of teaching children with autism or aspergers.  These don't have to be special schools, although that too must be considered IF you think that is the environment that would suit him best.
Your son might have Disordered Speech; Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder, differences in his Receptive and Expressive speech (receptive speech is usually much weaker, delayed, or disordered); Auditory Processing Disorder or Delayed Auditory Processing.  When you google those and read them, if any sound relevant ask the SALT to assess your son for them.
Does your son ever repeat things he has heard on TV or in films, or does he repeat things you have said to him?
My son also did not ask for help in school.  This is down to a concept called 'generalisation' where those on the spectrum learning to do a certain skills in one environment or with one person (eg. at home with mum), but cannot use that same skill in a different environment or with a different person (eg. at school with a teacher).  This will apply to everything he learns and the teachers need to be working with you so that he learns things in many different environments and also with different people.

        For a child that is severely affected it is difficult because you are a carer 24/7.  Over the years that really takes it toll on your physical and mental health.
Have you ever had respite care?
If he is capable of moving into group home then that can be something positive, as he will need to be prepared in a place for when you are not around any longer.
I have an older sister who has learning difficulties.  She doesn't sound as severe as your son.  She works in a special factory for disabled people.  She moved into a warden controlled housing association when she was in her late forties.  She is doing okay there.  Both my parents and my sister needed this to happen as they were unhappy living together.  Sometimes there can be very different personalities.  For example my mother is obsessed with cleaning.  My sister could not care less about that side of things.  The continual fights and arguments about that one subject were draining.
Regarding his behaviours, have you looked at Sensory Integration Disorder?  If any of his senses are over or under sensitive that can sometimes account for alot of autistic behaviour.  Google the name Olga Bogdashina and read an article by her printed in Autism Today.  If that sounds like your son then you can find a book by her called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  That might give you an insight into what his sensory perception is and therefore where his behaviours are coming from and what you can do to reduce them.
Regarding talking all the time.  Is he repeating things he has seen on TV or films, or things that have been said to him?  Or is he trying to talk to you about his interests all the time?

        Unfortunately the answers are not out there.
Some children diagnosed with autism do acquite some speech and then regress and lose it.  My son just didn't get that explosion of vocabulary at the age of 3+ that other children do.  Instead he started repeating things he heard from TV.  
There are many disorders that are not present at birth, but become active in childhood or even adulthood, especially the mucle wasting diseases.
I personally don't think vaccines are responsible, because my son was showing signs of autism before he had his MMR vaccination.  
I think there may be a genetic weakness or mutuation, but no-one has identified it yet.
Where are all these autistic children coming from?  Again no-one knows, but something is definately happening because diagnosis rates are going up and if that had always been happening then where are all the autistic adults??
Do not waste your time or energy on bizarre therapies that promise the earth.  There is no cure or recovery.  There are ways to help them improve and develop and some children do so well that they are considered to be outside of the diagnostic criteria.  But that is for a few, not for all (although all do develop and improve and gain skills as they get older).
As your son likes to look at the chandelier and likes to spin, I would suggest he is assessed by an Occupational Therapist who has experience of Sensory Integration Disorder as well as autism.  Many (if not all) those on the autistic spectrum have sensory differences meaning they do not perceive things as we do.  Some noises, smells/tastes/textures/touch can be too much for them to tolerate.  Or, if they are undersensitive they may spin, or stare at visual stimulus, or appear deaf, or appear not to feel pain etc.  It is important that you begin to get a understanding of this and how this will affect your childs development and social interaction because it will help you make the right choices about the kinds of supports he needs.  
When he is a bit older I would suggest he is screened for Irlen Syndrome (google that to see what it is).  This affects the visual sense and can be rectified just by wearing Irlen tinted lenses in glasses.  Those with problems with visual perception sometimes do not see things as we do.
Balance and co-ordination are also senses.  Some children might appear to have poor balance, or be clumsy or they may be almost like untaught gymnasts.  I know a boy who joined the county trampoline team having never had a lesson in his life, but he can do all the movements immediately, it is amazing to watch.
As he is so young I would also ask the OT to give you advice about the kinds of activities that can improve brain development.  These will be things like crawling eg. buy those fabric tubes and play hide and seek with him.
As he is not verbal you need the Speech Therapist to show you how to use symbols and for you to use them to show your son the daily routine.  This will be something like a timetable, but the structure and routine should help him understand and cope better with change.
As your child grows try to get him involved in as much one to one stuff as you can.  Anything he is interested in get him to do it with something eg. lego, swimming, drum lessons, fishing etc etc.  They tend to do much better in one to one situations and really struggle in group or team work.  Use any interests or obsessions to teach concepts and to encourage social interaction.
I know it is a bombshell to get a diagnosis.  And you will need time to grieve for the child you thought you had and for the future you thought was infront of them.  That is natural.  You will have some really dark days, but it will pass and it does get better.  
My son is at a mainstream school that has experience and expertise in autism.  He is in a class with 20 other children.  He can talk and communicate.  He can make jokes and tease me and even lie convincingly!  He likes to play (although he needs adult support sometimes or structure to do this).  He is assessed as being above average intelligence.  
If I were you I would be wanting him assessed by an OT and a psychologist.  I would also be looking around at nurserys and infant schools that have experience of teaching those with autism.
I would also recommend joining a parent support group because you will get lots of information and advice from other parents who have already been through what you are going through now.

        You really need your child to be seen by a number of professionals including Speech and Lanaguage Therapist, Clinical Psychologist and Occupational Therapist.
She may have autism, which can range from mild to severe.  My son is on the autistic spectrum and some of the things you mention sound familiar.  But I am a parent, not a professional.
It sounds like she may have sensory issues which an OT should be able to help with.  Google DSM IV for autism and look at the criteria to see if it sounds like your child.  Also google Sensory Integration Disorder to see if that applies.  But appearing over and under sensitive through the senses is classic.  So she might appear deaf at one time and then appear to hear the smallest sound at another time.  She might have difficulties with how her clothes feel.  She might cover hear ears at noise, she might have balance and co-ordination problems, or her balance and co-ordination might be better than other children.  She might have problems with the taste, texture and smell of food.  
If she has problems chewing she might have dyspraxia, which might also affect her ability to speak.  
Being fascinated by certain visual stimuli is also classic of both autism and sensory integration disorder.  That may also indicate she may have Irlen Syndrome which is something you could test for later, but which is rectified by wearing glasses with tinted irlen lenses.  Google Irlen Syndrome to see about that.
The fact that she doesn't play with toys and gets frustrated and hits and bites herself is also classic to autism.  That is due to a lack of imagination and flexibility of thought that can make it hard for them to know how to play.
Regarding waiting for assessments.  Some universities specialise in diagnosising autism and you might be able to get an assessment sooner and for free.  In the USA you could try contacting the Autistic Society of America for advise with that.
I would also recommend you repeat this post in the autism forum as there may be other parents in your area/country that could give you some advice.

        Yes those on the autistic spectrum can show affection.  But you have to remember that sometimes it is inappropriate or it is not generalised.  That means that some children might be totally uninterested in other children whilst others might be overly friendly and touching and hugging them all the time.  Both extremes are inappropriate.  In your case your daughter is affection with you but not with other people because she hasn't learnt 'who' she should be affection with ie. familiar people vs strangers, and she hasn't learn't 'how' to do it.  Ie. you might just give a friendly greeting to someone you know slightly, but might hug another family member.  These difficulties with social interaction and social communication will be lifelong.  A Speech and Language Therapist should assess these skills and a programme should be put into place to teach her.

        A lot of what you describe falls into the autism/asperger's spectrum but the only way to know is to have him evaluated by a professional with experience with autism and asperger's. I think that it would be beneficial for you to take a look at some of the information about and resources for asperger's and autism because they will give you tips that will help regardless of your son's diagnosis. If he is socially inept, regardless of what it ends up being called, programs to teach social awareness will benefit him. If he is very resistant to eye contact then a desensitization program might help. (Have him look you in the eye and count to five using ""one, one thousand, two, one thousand and gradually increase the time up to about ten seconds. I actually taught myself eye contact using that method and most people don't realize I have Asperger's through casual contact with me.)

        He is just at the age when he should be starting to get more social, so you need to keep a watch on that.
If you think he is delayed in his speech then having him assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist won't do him any harm, and if he does need some extra help then he will be getting it from a very early age, which is also good because the earlier any therapies start they have a better chance of making good progress.
Children with autism do throw tantrums like you mention, but so do other 2/3 year olds.  The thing that is more noticeable is that, obviously it becomes age inappropriate when they are still doing it as they get older.  But it is usually around change or stopping/ starting things ie. if I had to turn off the TV to go out my son would get very upset, because he needs to see the TV programme to the end.  Their tantrums also 'seem' out of proportion to the thing that upset them.  So it appears like an over reaction.
Changes in routine can upset them or changes in expectations ie. if you said you were going to the supermarket, but then remembered you needed petrol and went to the petrol station first, then a child with autism might get upset by that.
There are also alot of sensory issues.  So, as you say they can appear deaf when you call their name, yet at other times they demonstrate acute hearing, or they may cover their ears at sudden unpredictable noise, or if you put the vaccum cleaner on.  They can be touch sensitive and complain that they have been hurt when they have only been touched or they can appear to feel no pain.  They may prefer certain types of fabrics, with tags removed, because otherwise it hurts their skin.  They can have problems around putting on socks and shoes.  They may complain about smells or tastes or textures, or appear to be unable to smell or like to taste non-food items.  They may also have problems with balance and co-ordination.  These sensory differences fluctuate between hyper and hypo sensitive throughout the day and day to day.  
Socially they may appear uninterested in other children, or they may appear to want to join in but don't seem to know how.  Or if they do join in they can't understand the rules of the game or what is expected of them.
They can have some imagination, but certain types of imagination may be poor or missing.  Google theory of mind to see what that is, as most children on the spectrum have difficulties with that. 
There can also be certain repetitive behaviours of mannerisms such as flapping (which is suspected of being a sensory thing), or spinning round, walking on tip toes, following lines on the floor, walking up and down or round in circles.
The only way that a diagnosis can be given is through observations and assessments.  So if you are really concerned, then the first stage would be to go to your GP and express your concerns and ask for him to be referred to a Speech and Language Therapist.

If he is having such problems with food I suspect he has sensory issues with either the taste, texture or smell of food.  Or he has rigid behaviours and routines that allow him to only eat certain foods and only when they are presented in a certain way.
What are his other senses like?  Is he okay with sound or does he cover his ears or appear deaf.  Is he touch sensitive or does he appear not to feel pain.  Does he have to wear certain types of clothes and have tags removed etc.  Is his balance and co-ordination okay?
If he does have sensory issues these can fluctuate between being over and under sensitive throughout the day.

        HI,

It would be really useful if triggers to these aggressive behaviours can be established as this way, you will be able identify the causes and try to deal with them more effectively.

If he is verbal, then you could perhaps start with teaching him very simply negotiation vocab. e.g. stop it, i don't like it, no, etc.  

Ensure that you are not reinforcing any tantrum behaviour and try to re-direct the behaviours to something more appropritate wherever possible.

Does your son mix up his pronouns eg. I, me, you, yours, mine, us etc.
What is your son's social interaction skills like?
Are there things that your son is good at eg. puzzles, lego, pattern recognition etc.
Are the people/professionals, who have seen him so far, experienced in diagnosising autistic spectrum disorders such as PDD/NOS, Autism, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Aspergers, High Funtioning Autism etc.  If not I would be specifically asking for a referal to a centre/unit that does.
Google DSM IV for autism and read through the diagnositic criteria.  Does your child have diffficulties in the three areas it mentions?
What type of school does your son go to and what country are you in?

        It might be.  Have you looked at the diagnostic criteria for Aspergers.  Google 'DSM IV Aspergers' and read through the list of characteristics.  Remember a person only has to get a couple of the characteristics out of each list.
A need to control could be down to a need for predictable outcomes and also a lack of imagination.  Does he tend to re-enact things he has seen on TV or in films.
What is his language like and his tone of voice.  He seems to be unaware of how to hold a conversation properly which is very common.  He isn't being rude, he just doesn't realise that conversation is a two way process.  At the moment he seems to be giving dialogues and is talking at other people, again this is typical of Aspergers.
He might also have some rigid rituals or routines which could also include the need for certain foods to be served together and anything else considered to be wrong or unacceptable.
My son is high functioning autistic and he also comes across almost like a 'director' , especially in play.  He will tell you what you are, and what you should do.  You cannot deviate from this toryline.  If you tried he would curtail that route or he might start to get upset or angry with me.  That is because they need things to be predictable and therefore already know in their own mind what they want to happen.  If you use your imagination to change the play it completely throws them.
My son also accuses me of making him 'lose his place'.  That is usually when he is doing or saying something and I interrupt to ask him something or to clarify.  And it is true we have made them lose their place and usually they have to go back to the beginning and start again whether it is something they were thinking, saying or doing.
It is possible to talkative and bright and still be on the autistic spectrum.  Even Einstein was thought to have traits of autism!
His rituals at bedtime could be classed as repetitive rituals and routines under the diagnostic criteria.  
I think if it is becoming more noticeable that something is not quite right and if it is starting to impact on his ability to socialise with his peers then it might be time to raise concerns because he may need supports in school especially during breaktimes and dinnertimes so that he isn't bullied for being awkward or 'different'.
It might be a good starting point to say that you suspect that he may have Aspergers and ask for a Speech and Language Therapist with experience of Aspergers to assess both his speech and social communication abilities.

        she might be on the autistic spectrum at the 'gifted' end.  Or she might have some autistic traits, but not enough to get her a diagnosis.  These are a couple of things she might have difficulties with.  I am a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum.  Your post makes me wonder about the following:-
Firstly are you sure that her comprehension of her reading is good?  I would advise that a Speech and Language Therapist assesses her comprehension skills as well as her receptive and expressive language abilities to see how she does.  Autistic children can teach themselves to read, but sometimes there isn't the understanding behind it, or the understanding comes much later than the ability to read.
I would also ask that she is assessed for Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder (Google it and see if it sounds relevant).  Does she appear to have delays understanding speech eg. does she reply to questions about 10 seconds or more after being asked?
You say she can play and socialise okay.  Google Theory of Mind to see if that sounds relevent as those on the spectrum tend to have varying difficulties with this.
But the main thing you have posted sounds like Sensory Integration Disorder.  Someone who is at the forefront of this is a woman called Olga Bogdashina.  She has written a brilliant book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  Google her name and read an article by her in Autism Today.  Her book has a caregivers questionnaire at the back that you can complete to get sensory profile of your child.
But spinning rocking, appearing deaf, appearing blind (unable to see or recognise things in certain situations eg. not seeing a pencil on top of a desk) is typical of what Olga talks about.
You might also google Irlen Syndrome as those with autism, dyslexia and sensory perceptual problems can sometimes be greatly helped by just wearing these glasses with the tinted lenses.
If she has difficulty following instructions, organising and planning, understanding time etc then I would google Executive Function Disorder to see if that is relevant.
All of the different disorders I have mentioned are common to autism.  Some you can have without autism.  I think you might find some answers in some of those disorders.  Post back and let me know what you think?

        Although you are being confused by alot of different possible diagnosis, all the variations being mentioned are still on the autistic spectrum.
Sometimes professionals can take the clinical diagnositic criteria too black and white.  For example my son can make eye contact.  But if he is trying to think about what he wants to say then no he cannot make eye contact.  
Their ability to function varies day to day and even throughout the day.  
From a sensory point of view they can appear deaf, cover their ears at noise, hear the slightest sound, or start banging on something to make noise.  This means that there is a great fluctuation in his ability to perceive and process auditory information.  All of his senses could be fluctuating in the same way.  When that is happening we cannot imagine how difficult it would be to make sense of anything.
Yes, those on the spectrum can play to some extent at some times.  You might find that alot of their play is re-enacting something they have already seen or heard.  They can also show some imagination, especially in their areas of interest.  They may express emotions and show affection to family members etc.  But they are still autistic.
It tends to become more obvious as they grow up.  A three year old might not behave differently to a family member and a stranger.  You would expect a 5 year old to know that you don't go up to a strange and touch, hug or kiss them.  So although they are showing affection and social interaction it is inappropriate and it is inappropriate because they don't understand social interaction as we do.
If he is eating non-food items that is sensory and is called Pica.
My son has only recently started lining up some toys and he is 7.  He likes to play war games using soldiers.  He doesn't have any obsessions apart from having to watch TV.  He doesn't need routines or rituals although he doesn't like change or changes to his daily timetable or if his expectations are not met.
My son also has a strange tone of voice and although we are in the UK he speaks with an American accent!
If I were you I would read up about autistic spectrum disorders.
As he has alot of sensory issues I would recommend a book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers by a woman called Olga Bogdashina.  This book has a questionnaire at the back that you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.  Our autism outreach department uses this questionnaire, so I know it is valid.
I would probably accept the diagnosis to get the therapies and supports in place and then see how your child develops and improves.  There is no way that they will continue with that diagnosis if he can demonstrate abilities that take him off the spectrum.  It is not unusual for a diagnosis to change over time or even to be removed.  My son is diagnosed as being High Functioning Autistic, but his paediatrican has said that if he develops obsessions that his diagnosis might change to Aspergers.

Autism is not a physical problem that is permanent and inflexible.  It is neurological and therefore he may appear more autistic on some days than others.

        If you google 'DSM IV Aspergers', it will bring up the clinical criteria for diagnosising Aspergers.  This is a list of behaviours that the professionals will be looking at to decide if she has enough of those behaviours to get a diagnosis.
I am a parent of a child who has High Functioning Autism.  Alot of the things you mention as being 'weird' could be down to Aspergers.  But you really need to have your daughter assessed by a multi disciplinary team experienced in diagnosing autism.  Go to your doctor and ask for her to be referred to specialists that have experience of Aspergers.
You also mention alot of sensory seeking behaviour.  The cutting of fabric and fascination with water could be sensory.  What is she like with her clothes.  Do they have to have tags removed or be of a certain material.  She rocks, which is also sensory based, with a strong sense of smell and acute hearing.  That would indicate that she is experiencing things differently to you and others.  For example a 'normal' environment for you might be so loud it hurts her ears, with smells that are too strong.  She may have difficulties with 'feeling' where her own body is and so she rocks.  To avoid all these unpleasant sensations she may hide, or the hiding maybe to get into a small place to 'feel' squashed.  The professional to do an assessment would be an Occupational Therapist and you would want one who also has experience of Sensory Integration Disorder and Aspergers.
She also has interests that are not 'typical' and which maybe classed as obsessions. 
You say she never has friends of her own age.  It is quite typical for those on the spectrum to seek company with either younger children or older adults.  This is because younger children don't question and will go along with an older child, so they are really choosing a peer group that they can socialise with.  If they prefer adults it is because adults have patience to listen to them and their interests whereas their peers don't have these skills yet.
What was your daughter's speech development like as a toddler.  Did she acquire langugae as other children.  What is her ability to communicate and also understand what is said to her.  Does she take language literally.  Does she understand humour and sarcasm.  Her speech and social communication skills should be assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist and again, one that has experience of Aspergers.
From your post it sounds like your daughter is quite high functioning.  But she is obviously having alot of difficulties and with some input from professionals she could become much more able to socialise, because she needs to be taught all these skills.  She won't learn them by watching other people.  It won't make sense to her.
The emotional side of it, is simply that she doesn't understand many situations and maybe the implications of language.  She maybe getting totally overwhelmed by incoming sensory stimulus.  She may also have big problems with changes in routine, or unpredictable outcomes or changes to things she expected to happen.

        As she might be showing some signs of Sensory Difficulties I would also suggest you google Sensory Integration Disorder to see if that sounds relevant.  Sensory Differences can be experienced by those on the autistic spectrum.
I would also suggest googling the name Olga Bogdashina and reading an article by her in Autism Today.  She has a book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers which is very useful as it has a caregivers questionnaire at the back of the book that you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.  Our Autism Outreach Department uses this questionnaire, and we have had Olga come and give seminars to us.
I found that this book explained alot of my own son's behaviours and helped me see how I could change his environment and provide supports so that sensory issues did not cause him so many difficulties.
Typical sensory problems are appearing to be deaf, or covering their ears, or getting upset at sudden unpredictable noises eg. telephone ringing, vaccum cleaner.  Problems with touch as slight touch may hurt, or appearing not to feel pain, difficulties with clothes or socks and shoes, having to remove clothes tags, problems with brushing/cutting hair or cutting nails, problems with food tastes and textures as well as smells, problems with balance or co-ordination.  
A child can have difficulties in one sense or all of them, and it can fluctuate day to day or throughout the day.  So a child may appear deaf, cover their ears, then be seeking noise by banging things all in the same day!
You can also google DSM IV for autism and see what the clinical criteria is for diagnosing autism is.  
Your daughter is very young, so if she is assessed and needs therapies then it is more likely to have a positive effect.

        autism, including aspergers is on a spectrum.  So at one end you have typical 'normal' children and at the other you might have severely autistic children.  Somewhere within that range will be those with autism, autistic spectrum disorders, aspergers, traits of autism or aspergers etc.  It is quite possible to have traits, but not enough of them to get a diagnosis.  Also, as the diagnosis relies on having enough of the behaviours to get a diagnosis there are some children who are too able in one area to get a diagnosis.  
For example my son is diagnosed as being High Functioning Autistic.  He doesn't have any rigid routines or rituals and he doesn't have any obsessions.  If he does develop obsessions or restricted areas of interest then his diagnosis may change to Aspergers.  So it is a much more fluid thing rather than a concrete yes/no.
I think you need to raise your concerns and have your son assessed because even if he doesn't receive a diagnosis of aspergers it sounds like he may need some help with social skills.

        As you know, having a diagnosis of ASD means that your child will find any changes to routine or changes in surroundings/environment or expectations will cause him alot of stress.  My son when younger used to vomit if I turned the TV off, or took a toy off him, or took him out of the house etc etc.  He is much better now (he's 7).  But I suspect that firstly, your son is at a new school.  He is at an age when children are expected to be much more independent, and maybe he needs the supports and structures for longer, or for them to be withdrawn more gradually.
It is also worth considering anything before you tell him.  So having to move into another group is bound to be very stressful for him.  So it needs to be thought about and planned before it is even mentioned to him.  So a gradual cross over might be easier to achieve as well as talking to him about growing up and how people need to move into groups of a similar ability as they get better at something.  Use Social Stories etc.  He may find transitions very stressful and probably the vomiting is related to the 'fight or flight' reflex showing that he is in an high state of anxious arousal. 
As he is also verbal talk to him about his fears and take things a step at a time.  By taking small steps he will reach the same goal.  It doesn't have to be an immediate change if that upsets him.
His behaviour is a true reflection of his level of stress so just go with that.  Lower the expectations and slow down any transitions with step by step changes that are fully discussed and understood before they happen.
I know it is hard when you have other children.  Maybe you could involve them in the process as they will probably have a greater insight into his difficulties being of the same age.

I have taken him to many specialists and leave confused and with no answers. Because of this his Pediatrician is not willing to help me much further. I was just hoping to get some ideas and take those to him. I have advocated for him since he was little. I hate seeing him like this. Unexplained rashes, not sleeping through the night, and difficulty communicating with others. Very frustrating. He even avoids foods and liquids that he knows will make him feel worse. He can't tell me what they do to him he just refuses them when presented to him. I have an apointment with an ENT next week and hopefully get the tongue issue looked at. Again thank you for responding.

        The only thing I would add to what has already been advised is that her behaviour, although inappropriate, is an indication of the level of emotion she is feeling.  My son is on the spectrum and is verbal.  Through talking with him he has explained to me that when something upsets or angers him he gets totally flooded and overwhelmed with those feelings.  So his emotional reaction is out of proportion to the incident (in our point of view), and he cannot stop it or bring it under control.  I went to a seminar where they explained this by saying to imagine a shower curtain around a bath.  When we experience emotional activity the water (emotional feelings), are restrained and contained by the shower curtain.  In autistic individuals they think this restriction is weaker with no shower curtain, so the water goes all over the place.  This means that greater parts of their brains are flooded with activity and they cannot stop it or bring it quickly under control.
So your daughter does need professionals who will help her monitor her emotions and learn to express them appropriately.  Also any improvements in communication as well as a highly structured and low sensory environment are going to bring huge improvements.  But in general these tantrums and emotional outbursts remain even in adulthood.

        I know you've posted for an expert, but I wanted to tell you that for a long time I was thinking along the same lines as yourself.  BUT, after a couple of years, I am now aware that eventhough my son is very capable at some things in certain situations, his abilities are not generalised across the whole of his development and in many situations he is unable to give a 'normal' response.  
It may become more evident as your daughter gets older as to what her social strengths and weaknesses are.  That is the hard part to get to grips with.  It isn't that an autistic child 'can't' or 'doesn't' want to socialise.  It is that they will again show a 'spiky profile'.  So they may socialise brilliantly with some people, in some environments or situations - but be totally unable to socialise, or appear disinterested in other environments or with other people.  So a child with Aspergers may be able to socialise by talking to someone about his interests, but although that is socialising that child does not have an 'appropriate' way of interacting.  He is talking at the other person with no understanding or interest of whether the other person is even interested in what he is saying.  And he may also not be interested in what the other person wants to say to him, so the conversation can be very one sided.
Their need to socialise seems to be driven only by 'what they are getting out of it'.  It is very egocentric.  They don't socialise for the sake of it.  They aren't interested in (or aware of) the social do's and don'ts.  
They also have poor 'theory of mind', which plays a big part on how they interact.
Having a spiky profile means that certain skills will develop and may develop way ahead of her peers.  But these skills seem to be good because they are associated with their interests and therefore they are motivated to do them and improve these skills.  But they can totally neglect other areas of development because there isn't the motivation or the ability there.  
My son can tease me, and trick me.  He can lie convincingly.  He can blame his sister for something he has done.  Alot of it he has seen on TV, but he is beginning to use that learnt information and manipulate it into a new/different event, which is very encouraging.  But no matter how good he gets, I still don't think he will be off the spectrum because there are other skills that he simply cannot do.  
Does any of that make any sense?

        Although alot of children with Aspergers tend to acquire speech, they do tend to have problems with social interactions and don't automatically know what behaviour is appropriate and how to behave to different people in different situations.  In the UK it would be the Speech and Language Therapist who would look at this and put together a programme.  For example some children may not know how to end a conversation and therefore may say what they want to say, and then walk away leaving the other person confused and angry at their rude behaviour.  
So, first, I would say don't assume he is being rude to you or anyone.  Assume he doesn't know how to behave appropriately.  
Or he may have learnt his social behaviour from things he has seen on TV or films.  
My son is high functioning autistic and he certainly takes alot of his social cues and language from TV and films.  
What kind of school does your son attend.  If it is one that has experience and expertise in autism then they should have some sort of Social Skills group where they work on these skills.
The school learning environment is very important to those on the spectrum because they tend to have alot of sensory problems and so noises, smells, visual things can be a distraction and all this incoming sensory information can overwhelm them.  
The school might have been trying to introduce him to the Science lesson because it is an area that he does well in.  But it maybe that something about that class, or the level of support your son receives that is causing him problems which he will undoubtedly bring home.
If he is self aware, as my son is, then he may be becoming very negative because he can see that he is not at the same level as his peers.  He can see that he is continually failing and is not able to do what the other children can.  This is largely down to the school.  Either the school is not particularly good at meeting the needs of those on the spectrum, or they are not supporting him sufficiently or giving him achieveable targets.  Have you discussed his diagnosis with him?  Does he understand he has Aspergers and he isn't stupid or bad.  No-one likes to fail.  If we were in a job where we continually got things wrong and didn't understand what we should be doing or why and everyone seemed to think we were rude or stupid and that happened day after day, then we too would behave in a negative, rude, disruptive way.
My son is also dyslexic and has dyscalculia as well.  He is also very self aware and assessed as being above 75% on a cognitive ability scale as long as it doesn't involve verbal instructions.  It is hard to challenge academically them whilst also meeting their very specific needs.
I am a very firm believer that there is a 'reason' for any behaviour.  As he is verbal try asking him what he likes/dislikes about school.  Ask him if he is happy there.  Ask him if he has any friends, or would like to have friends etc etc.  But make sure you do this when he is calm and not when he is upset.  You might get some very open and honest answers.

        You don't have to agree to anything you are not happy with and that includes medications.
If you have concerns about autism you can ask your paediatrician for an evaluation by a multi disciplinary team that specialises in diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  You might also want to consider asking or getting an assessment from an Occupational therapist because his behaviour around being touched may be down to a tactile sensory issue and if one sense if out, then the chances are that others are also.  
He is over or under sensitive to light or bright objects, noise, smell, touch, taste, appears clumsy or unco-ordinated?

        My post was so long, I put it in two parts!

We have just completed my son's IEP.  He is 7.5 years and is at a mainstream school which has alot of experience of autism and also has an autism unit.
My son is verbal, but tends not to initiate conversations or ask for help etc.  On his IEP they have set targets whereby he has been given some picture symbols that he has been taught how to use.  The teaching staff are going to set up situations where he will need to ask for help to make sure that he is able to either ask for it verbally or use the card to request help.  Once they are sure he can do this to one nominated adult, they will generalise that learnt skill to other adults so that he can ask help of any teacher or adult within the school.  
They are going to help him to learn to initiate social interaction by sending him at least twice a day to give a simple message to another teacher, or they may send him to another teacher to ask them a simple question such as 'what is your name'.  
Later on they will need to teach him how to hold a two way conversation.  How to understand if the person you are talking to is interested in what you are saying.  How to listen to someone else even if you think what they are saying is boring.  How to take turns in conversation etc.
These are all very basic skills that children pick up very early in life.  But if your child does not have them, he has to be taught them.  Does that make sense?

Does she have IEP? Do they beleive that her behavior is the direct result of her condition? Do you live in the US? If your daughter has IEP and her behavior is the direct result of her Aspergers', they cannot expel, but rather to change IEP goals and write some behavior modification goals into it.

        It is very tough. My son now will not go to the bathroom at school, although that is not good, it is the best we have at the moment. The UnderJams Night Wear absorbent underwear work really well. They are designed to hold more then the standard pull up. There is another brand as well but I don't have the name available. I would not do this at home as if he is going to the washroom it is not good to get him off the path but for school and night time (night time training should be separate) it should be okay. You can rent the video's for the library as well. 'I can go potty', is a good one. If reinforcers work for you, you can try to set up a sticker, token or chocolate chip schedule for the good days as a treat for success. The only other thought I have is do you know if he has ever gone to the washroom at school? It is not uncommon for many children not wanting to go in a strange place and he is just to young to hold it. We have had no assitance with doctors, however it is good to speak to them to eliminate any medical challenges. I have looked into a behavioral therpist however they are very $$$$.

        Good Morning,
My son has been diagnosed for 2 years now with Aspergers syndrom- this is a form of high functioning autism- and he to is social with family and friends, will make eye contact and can follow instructions etc. Yet in other areas he has  ""swiss cheese"" like abilities for his age. loves to make noises, reptative motions, lines up toys does not play, has difficulty understanding abstract ideas and most of the time plays parallel to other kids but not with them. There are other things also that started showing up this year,like high anxiety. I have learned that just because your child does not fit the criteria to a T does not mean that your instincts as a mom are wrong. My advice is if you feel something is not right just keep persuing it till you get an answer. Ours took 5 years!

        I feel for you so much as I have a son, he is a little older but no matter how old he gets he will always be 5 years old.  I have seen drs since he was 4 years old.  They tell me he has global cognative impairment, which is just a fancy way of saying that he is mentally retarded.  I am not really sure why they say this bc he speaks four languages, yet he cannot read nor write his name.   Nor does he try.  He goes poop and wipes it all over the bathroom, he refuses to take a shower and when he does he stands in there for an hour and never once washes his hair nor his body.  When I asked what to do about this, I was told that I was not allowed to bathe him due to his age, bc I could go to jail for child molestation.  My son has just been arrested for this, he is 19, and we are at our wit's end.  No matter what I have tried to do, everyone involved in his life has told me he needs to be home with me, now he will either go to prison or he will go to a mental institution.  They told me that children like him could go one way or the other, very affectionate and sexual or very mean, I got one that is both.  He has hit me, tried to throw his sister down the stairs, hurt others, he makes up stories that are not only horrific and grusome, but they are sure to get someone into trouble real soon.  I urge you to find a child psychologist that deals only with these types of cases and follow your heart.  There are a lot of doctors that work for Social Services that work with children with these problems, alos there is a community place, it is called different names in different places, I am not sure where you are from, but here it is called Monadnock Family Services, MDS, in Hillsborough it is called Community Bridges.  Good Luck and God Bless You, I know I have had to have the patience of a Saint, but there is always a breaking point and for sure you do not want him to be where my child is.  KB

        I had to cut my post in two.  This is the second part.

To be more interested in learning, he has to be interested in the subject matter.  For example if he is interested in Starwars you can teach alot using that one subject.  
Progressing socially is going to be difficult.  Try to always use things he is interested in.  For example joining clubs that he likes.  Typical things that children on the spectrum enjoy is trampolining, swimming, rock climbing, scouts, fishing, art, music etc.  All of these involve social interaction.  But if he struggles with something like football it is useless trying to get him to play in a team.  He may find the concept of team games difficult.  He may not be able to tolerate unpredictable physical contact etc.
I have found Play Therapy very useful, but you have to find a Play Therapist who has experience of children on the spectrum and one that doesn't just use Play Therapy for children who are emotionally disturbed.

A possibility you might like to rule out is Irlen Syndrome.  Alot of children/adults with autism and dyslexia have this.  It is a visual perceptual problem which is easily helped by wearing tinted glasses or by using tinted overlays for written work.
If you google Irlen Syndrome, it should give you alot of information about it.  It is a recognised medical condition.

        Your baby sounds terribly brite!  They all mature at differant speeds and mature in one area faster than others.  I knew something was not right with my boy and know one would hear me.  They would all say the same thing I just said.  If you feel something is not right do not second guess yourself!
Be confident with what your views are.  Document everything that you see her do or hear her say.  Keep a jurnal and write down things as they occur with dates.  They will not test until 3 years old- that is the age when kids are gradually coming together in there stage of maturity. 

On an upscale note, I have a neighbor that had a little girl that did not speak until three when she did though it was in complete sentenses.  Turns out she is just extremely shy.

My advise to you would be to tell her to ""use her big girl words"" and make her use 3 word sentences.  It will be hard but instead of excepting ""Drink"" from her tell her to say ""want drink please"" Try this as well...  When asking her about her colors avoid ""wh"" questions like when, where, what and why.  instead of asking ""what color is this?"" as your said above ask instead ""Is this color blue?"" when infact the color is red she may surprise you and answer you by correcting you with saying ""Red"".  Then ask ""Am I Daddy?""  and see if you can make communication that way.  Try to keep the questions ones that are not yes and no answers

Hope I helped some.

        I am a parent not a professional.
Google echolalia and see if that is relevant to how your son uses speech.  If it is then you need to go to your doctor and ask for a referal to a Speech and Language Therapist.  If you suspect autism, tell your doctor that and you should ask for a SALT with experience of this diagnosis.
As well as a SALT a paediatrician and physcologist should observe and assess your son before you get any kind of diagnosis.
If you go onto the Autism forum, at the top right hand corner of the page click on the Health Page icon and go into the Behaviourial Characteritics behind a Diagnosis of Autism.  That gives the DSM IV clinical diagnostic criteria.  This is the criteria the doctors look at to decide if your child is autistic (on the spectrum) or not.  Parents have also posted examples of their childs behaviour that meets the criteria, so that should help you see what behaviours the doctors are looking for.

        A book I found very useful about sensory issues is by Olga Bogdashina called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  If you google her name you can read an article by her in Autism Today.
In that book there is a caregivers questionnaire that you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.  Our Autism Department uses this questionnaire and asks all parents to complete it.
From reading the book my understanding is that all information and learning about our environment comes in through all our senses.  If any of them are not functioning properly and are not able to receive or interpret that information, or if there is a problem with the communication between the senses, then a child/adult may rely on other senses to discover its environment.
Trying to address these differences means that you have to use ways such as Ridina mentions to keep the child safe.  But I would also suggest looking at the other senses to see if any improvements in them could lead to a reduction in the chewing.  The abovementioned book should help you get a better picture of your child's sensory profile so that you know what areas to start working on.

        It is possible that your son has Asperger's or ASD.  This is NOT ADHD but if undiagnosed can lead to lots of frustration on the part of the child, parents and teachers.  One symptom is the inability to pick up on escalation of social interactions, and the child lashing out"" out of frustration when he is unable to communicate and/or feels he is being atacked for no reason.  Quite often this reaction will be out of scale with the apparent initial causes, since the child is not able to figure out what is going on in that social situation.

Educate yourself about Asperger's and autism spectrum disorders to see if other aspects of his behavior fit the above picture.  Then pursue interventions that can help your child become more aware of social situations and better able to ask for help when feeling overwhelmed or frustrated

        I'm not an expert, just a parent with a child on the autistic spectrum and with sensory integration disorder.
From reading your post the thing that springs to mind is tics or tourettes.  You don't say if he has a diagnosis of anything else.  If he is on the spectrum, and temper tantrums can be part of this because of their frustration and our not keeping to their rigid routines/rituals or expections; then tourettes is one of those disorders that can also occur with autism.
But to find out for sure you will need to go to your GP or your child's paediatrician and ask for an assessment.  
If it is tics or tourettes then these are usually worse if the child is anxious or stressed, so it would help to look at any ways you can reduce his stress and anxiety levels by using structured systems so that he knows what is going to happen in what order throughout the day.

It is just so ironic that so many people post on the forums fearing a diagnosis, when those of us who have one fear it being taken away!

I can't answer your question as to whether delay is always autism, as I am not a medical professional.  I don't think it always is.  But delay is one of the criteria for a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder.
He is 2, and is just at that age when he should be becoming more social.  If he appears to not be interested in other toddlers, or is frightened of them, that would indicate a problem with social interaction.  But at 2 years old you would have to wait to see if that social side improves.
Does he has have sensory problems you are aware of.  Does he like to be hugged and touched, what is he like having his hair brushed, or cut, or his nails trimmed.  Is he okay wearing different types of fabrics, does he need tags removing from clothes.  Is he very active all the time, or is he always sitting down quietly.
I have started a Health Page, which you can assess through the autism forum page and click on the icon on the top right hand side of the page.  I have put the diagnostic criteria for autism in there and have asked parents to put examples of their own children's behaviour so that others will have an idea of what kinds of things the professionals are looking for when they observe the child or speak to the parents.  That may give you some help to know what you are looking for.

        There are a number of conditions/disorders that can tend to cluster together sometimes in one person or within the family.  These are things like autism/aspergers, OCD, touretts, Bi-polar, Dyspraxia, Sensory Integration Disorder, Learning Difficulty etc etc.
My understanding of OCD is that it is usually anxiety driven and the person usually feels that if they don't do the ritual/routine that something bad will happen to them or family members.  That is different to how someone with Aspergers may need a ritual or routine because it makes the situation familiar and predictable.  If your son is talking about a bad taste in his mouth making him want to spit that sounds like it could be a sensory thing because it is the 'bad taste' driving him to spit, not anxiety or a need for a predictable outcome.  It is quite possible that he does indeed have a 'bad' taste in his mouth because he is oversensitive to something.  Taste is also closely connected to smell.  Does he ever complain about smells or like to smell things?
If you are able to pay for a private Psychologist report then it could be very useful, especially if there are co-morbid conditions (ie. not just one diagnosis going on).  Make sure it is someone with expertise in autism/aspergers.  You should also try to find out about any parent support/advocates in your area.  This will help you find out what your rights are by law.  Anyone who assess your son through Education or Health will have a 'budget' they are working with and the idea is to provide the least amount they can get away with.
So you need a specialist evaluation that will show you what your sons strengths and weaknesses are and how Aspergers affects him from a language, social interaction, imagination, cognitive, behavioural, life skills point of view.  Then you need to know your legal rights and what you can ask for from a support point of view.  For example if it says in a report that your son needs to be in small group work, what does that mean.  You need it quantified ie. a small group of 3-5 children.  Otherwise his school could define a small group as being 15 children.  The same will apply to every recommendation they make.  Eg. he needs help to make friendships.  What specialist is going to advise school on that.  Who will they train in the daily implementation of that programme in school.  How often will it be included in his weekly timetable.  How will they monitor his progress.  How often will it be reviewed and by whom.  If that is not specified then the school may interpret that recommendation as 'he needs to play a game with another pupil' to fulfill that specification and it will only happen when they have the time to do it.  So it needs to be specific.  I've sort of gone off on a tangent, but once you get the information from reports (private ones if you can afford, and if you can't afford it aim for one private report a year), get recommendations quantified in terms of hours and staffing provision.  Otherwise if you don't get it quantified you can never prove if they are providing the support mentioned in the reports.  And they can also try to mainstream him if there are no quantified hours ie. a pupil needing 22+ hours a week support in one to one and small group work of no more than 5 children is less likely to get mainstreamed than a child whose reports state he needs 'significant' support, but who has only ever received 5 hours extra support a week if it was available.  That child will get mainstreamed first.
Try to prioritise reports from a need point of view.  If there are lots of things 'going on' that you are unclear about a private Psychologists report might be the most sensible first.  Depending on what that identifies you may need an Occupational Therapist's report next etc etc.
If there is other sensory stuff going on such as a dislike of loud/sudden noises, an aversion to certain types of clothing or tags in clothes or shoes and socks, an aversion to brushing/washing hair, problems with food texture or smells, problems with balance or proprioception (motor co-ordination), problems with recognising the samer person/environment even if there are slight changes etc then I would recommend you google the name Olga Bogdashina and read an article by her printed in Autism Today website.  She has two autistic children herself and is the principle of a school for autistic children in the Uktraine.  Her book Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Aspergers and Autism is groundbreaking stuff and gives a real insight into the strange behaviours we see (such as the spitting you mention with your son).
I'm not sure about the face pulling etc.  Could be part of anxiety due to fear through the book you said he read.  You have to remember that they don't have the imagination to recognise what is fact and fiction.  They take what they see and read literally.  You may need to explain to him that the book is not real and although it is really scary some people like that, but that he is safe because it is not real.
My son had alot of problems around stuff he saw on TV that he thought was real.  I had a touch time trying to explain to him what actors were and that they were playing out a story.  Even now he sometimes doesn't get that it is not real.  He can watch a film and get really upset with the storyline, especially if someone dies or gets hurt.  To us it is obvious that it is fiction, but to them it is real and they can get scared that it will happen to them.
Hope some of that makes sense and is helpful.

        There are a number of conditions/disorders that can tend to cluster together sometimes in one person or within the family.  These are things like autism/aspergers, OCD, touretts, Bi-polar, Dyspraxia, Sensory Integration Disorder, Learning Difficulty etc etc.

        You are bound to have some concerns if autism is already in the family.  But children can have strange interests and not be on the spectrum.
On the autism forum, if you click on the Health Page link at the top right hand corner of the forum page I have posted the diagnostic criteria under DSM IV for autism and have asked parents to post examples of their childs' behaviour that fits the criteria.  This will give you examples of the behaviours the professionals are looking for.
If he has typical speech development then that would usually rule out autism, but might mean Aspergers.  But those with Aspergers although their speech is considered 'normal' may still have problems processing language, or may have literal interpretation of language.  They can sometimes have a strange tone of voice or emphasis the wrong part of words, or they may have an accent.
But as already stated, to get a diagnosis your nephew would have to demonstrate difficulties across all the areas.  If that were not the case then he might not get a diagnosis at all, or might have some autistic traits, or could be PDD NOS.
I am not saying that I think he is on the spectrum, just giving examples of how the diagnosis process works.
I would say have a look at the Health Page.  Search DSM IV for Aspergers to see what the difference is.  Then just observe him and keep an eye on his development and how he appears in relation to his peer group.  If there are any concerns then they should be raised through the GP or Paediatrician and a full evaluation should be asked for by professionals who have experience in diagnosing children on the spectrum.

        I am a parent of a 7 year old boy with autistic spectrum disorder.  Alot of what you mention sounds familiar to me with my son who is on the spectrum.  But it all depends on the extent that he does these things.  For example I went to my GP when my son was 3 and told the doctor that he was repeating things he had seen on the TV or adverts or on DVDs, and I was told that that is typical development.  Well it is to a certain extent.  But if your child is repeating phrases over and over, or repeating long dialogues to himself and giggling along to the funny bits, or using TV dialogue to communicate (which my son was), then that isn't normal.
Some of the things you mention could be sensory based, but again all children do do these behaviours.  My son used to spin, and still walks or runs in circles repeating stuff to himself.  And my son is high functioning and goes to a mainstream school.
You also mention he is sensitive to the sound of the baby.  That can be quite a common complaint of those on the spectrum about their younger siblings.  But again at his young age it could be considered 'normal'.
What I want you to know about sensory issues is that they can fluctuate between over and under sensitive throughout the day and day by day.  So for example one of my sons sensory difficulties is auditory.  So if I get the vaccum cleaner out my son and the cat run for cover.  He complains about noises I can't even hear.  He has a pair of ear defenders that he likes to wear in school.  However he also goes to drum lessons (his choice), and he likes the sound of bursting balloons!  He also appears deaf if he is absorbed watching TV or making a lego model.  Sometimes I have to repeat his name a number of times before he hears me.  That is a huge variation, so I suppose a better way to describe sensory difficulties is that their perception of incoming sensory stimuli is inconsistent and their response to the same level of stimuli can vary enormously.
Those on the spectrum also have a huge amount of attention and focus for the things they are interested in eg. lego models, puzzles, TV, thomas etc.  But they have very little/no attention for things that don't interest them.  If they are absorbed in something and a baby is crying it will disrupt their concentration and will upset them greatly.  But an inconsistent response to the same sensory stimuli is experienced by all those on the spectrum.
If you go to the autism forum and click on the health page link on the top right hand side of the page I have posted the diagnostic criteria under DSM IV for autism and parents have posted examples of their child's behaviours that meet the criteria.  That might help you get an idea of what you should be looking for.
I am not saying I think your son is on the spectrum, but I do recognise some of the things you are saying, but again it all depends on the extent to which he is doing some of that stuff.  Only you are the best judge of how he appears with his peer group.  If you have concerns then you should ask for your paediatrician to refer him for an evaluation.  If it did turn out he was on the spectrum he does sound very capable and at the higher functioning end.  As autism/aspergers can be from severe to mild, or can be just some traits but not enough to even get a diagnosis.

        I'm a parent of a 7 year old boy with an autistic spectrum disorder.  My understanding is that 'delay' means that the child is not showing age appropriate skills in that particular area.  That being the case any autistic child could be called delayed with their speech, their social interaction, etc.  So could children with other diagnosis such as ADHD.  But to get a diagnosis of any disorder the child has to show enough of the charteristics in each category.  If they don't they might get no diagnosis, or it might mention traits of ....., or it might be PDD NOS ie. a pervasive developmental delay not otherwise specified, which basically means delays in certain areas but not enough of them or not in all the categories to get a full diagnosis.
As your son is just 3, he is just at that age when he will be becoming more social.  If there are any problems in that area then it will begin to show itself from this age onwards. If you go onto the autism forum page and click on the Health Page link at the top right hand side of the page I have posted the diagnostic criteria under DSM IV for autism, and parents have posted examples of their childrens' behaviour that fitted those criteria.  This will give you practical examples of what the professionals are looking for.
My advice would be to get as much therapy for your child as you can now whilst he is young and get supports in place for nursery and school.  It might be that your child has a few ADHD traits and maybe some autistic ones.  Sometimes it is just a case of having to wait and see how he develops.  But there are lots of things you can be doing.
You are already seeing Speech and Language Therapy.  
If your son has any sensory issues ie. over or under sensitive to certain things or seeks spinning, bouncing etc then an Occupational Therapist is the person you need to be referred to.
I was recommended by both Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy to get my child crawling eg. through tubes, under the duvet etc because certain movements improve the development of the brain.  Trampolining is also good because it helps the sensory side whilst also improving co-ordination, listening skills (because you have to listen to the instructions).  It can also help you highlight certain problems, for example my son found it very hard to copy certain movements demonstrating he has some cognitive/motor problems which will cause him difficulties in classroom environments.  But that is for later.  Now you want stuff that is age appropriate for a 3 year old.  So, if I were you, instead of just waiting to be referred you could find an OT and Physiotherapist who have experience with childhood development and autism/ADHD and either ask them to come and assess your son privately (if you have the money), or you could be cheeky and just ask for 10 minutes worth of advice over the phone.  There really is alot of physical stuff you could be doing playing with your son that will improve his brain development.
I've wandered away from your question somewhat.  But if you imagine an apply salad = a typically developing child, a banana salad = diagnosis of autism, and a pineapple salad = diagnosis of ADHD etc etc, then you will clearly see that some children are a mixed salad, or maybe apple salad with two pieces of banana.  If you look at it that way it might make it easier to understand.

        As odd as the behaviour seems to you, I would rather go with it then prescribe medication.  Try to accommodate his need if you can.  Normally a licking/tasting thing is a hypo sensitive reaction ie. not getting enough information througth the senses that they need to taste to get the information they need.  Do you have the impression that any of his other senses are not functioning eg. vision, hearing, smell, etc.  I know that from a 'normal behavioural approach' what your son is doing is going to appear weird to others.  But don't medicate just because of that!  It sounds like it is mainly down to sensation.  What about taking a bottle of water with you and letting him clean his feet. then offer him a lollipop.  Try to analyse the behaviour.  If he loves salty things his taste could by hyposensitive and he is using his taste in licking hands/feet to understand his enviornment.  Try giving him other things to mouth eg. keys, lollipops, chewy sweets etc to see if this helps.
Do you suspect any problems with his other senses.  Is his vision okay.  Does he have problems with floor colours or patterns, depth perception etc.  Is his hearing okay, or does he have problems with loud noises.
What is he like with food in general.  Is he quite restrictive.  Does he always ask for a certain kind of food and drink?
There can be OCD tendencies, but it is just as plausible that it could be rigid behaviours and routines.  So don't panic yet!  
Sometimes they have a new behaviour/obsession and it lasts a couple of months and they grow out of it.  Don't give it too much attention, but try to analysis it as much as you can.  Ask him about it and what he is doing and why.

        I presume you are a nursery care provider?  Aren't there usually procedures that educational settings should follow?  I think before you speak to the parents you should find out what the referral procedures are and maybe speak to some of the professionals eg. Speech and Language Therapist, Educational Psychologist etc about how to go about informing the parents of your concern.  In the UK the Health Visitor is usually still involved pre-school.  Once you have found out what the procedures are it might be worth arranging a meeting with the parents and another professional to talk about your concerns.  Ask them if they have any concerns about him.  There is always the possibility that one of the parents may also be Aspergers, or may have some autistic traits.  I know that my family has alot of autistic traits and therefore it was hard to see what was different with my son.  In the end it was the degree it affected him that brought him within the criteria for a diagnosis.  But I can still attribute alot of his behaviours to family members!
Try to explain to them that their child may find it harder at full time school and that it would be better to find out now and get the supports needed in place before he starts school, rather than leave it until the school calls them or their son starts to get really upset.  
It maybe that he doesn't have Aspergers, although I agree that alot of what he is doing is familiar, but the fact is it is your job as the professional to raise your concerns with the parents.  
Try to understand that this will be devastating for the parents to hear.  Afterall it is a lifelong condition that will affect all aspects of the childs life.  Getting a diagnosis is not the end of the world, but it does feel like that at the beginning.  Try to get across that you are trying to do what is best for the child and are giving your recommendations to the parents.  Try to empathise with them.  Don't take it personally if they get really upset or angry.  When I was first told that my son was probably on the autistic spectrum, I felt as if a policeman had just told me that my son was dead.  All my hopes, dreams, expectations were suddenly torn away.  I was absolutely devastated and cried and grieved for a long time.  I know that's going to scare you a little to be the messenger.  But you are the first person to notice possible problems, and in future years, they may thank you for it.  Or if they don't, maybe the second or third person to say the same thing will finally sink in that there is a problem.
Tell them your concerns.  Ask them if they are happy for you to refer your son to other professionals for them to assess him, and take it from there.
No easy answers I'm afraid.

        It is very hard when you receive a diagnosis.  It is a relief in some ways because most mothers have had concerns for quite a while beforehand that things were not quite right.  But we are still hoping for something less serious/pervasive/not life long than autism.  But how you are feeling is probably down to the fact that you will have to change your perceptions/expectations of your child.  Throughout all of this your child has not changed, they are still the same.  But the knowledge that comes with a diagnosis means we may have to 'let go and grieve' for some things.  No professional will be able to tell you the prognosis, or how your child will develop.  I found for some time that I was having to 'let go' of expectations because he wasn't developing in those areas.  Then he would suddenly progress in other areas and almost catch up.  Someone sent me a good article about how you feel when you get a diagnosis and I put in in my journal if you want to read it.  Someone else put another explanation called Arrived in Holland (I think).  But it is very early days for you, and there are lots of parents who have walked the path before you and are there to give you support and advice.
Regarding what diagnosis your son gets.  There are a number of conditions that tend to cluster together (autism/ADD/ODD/OCD/Tourettes/Anxiety/Depression/Dyslexia/ Dyspraxia/Irlen Syndrome - to name a few!).  Some children are just one diagnosis, some are more than one, some are traits from alot of conditions but not enough to get a diagnosis in any of them.  Think of it as a fruit salad (which is how it was explained to me).  A fruit salad can be made up of one kind of fruit or a mixture of fruits, but it is still a fruit salad.
I would say read up as much as you can about any condition your son is diagnosed with.  Get as much help/intervention as possible to help support your child.  Find what support groups are in your area and find one you feel comfortable with.  As your child matures, it is not unusual for diagnosis to change or even be removed.
As far as I know all children are seen by Clinical Psychologist along with others prior to getting a diagnosis.

        If you do have concerns, you should take your child to a peditration specilaized with child development. With the referal with the doctor, you can see other specialist for child development and also, you should ask public school system give your son an evaluation too. If there is nothing wrong, halilua!

        Of course there is hope, and bathtubs loads of it.  What your child is doing now is really positive stuff.  Any concerns by your pediatrician or yourself need to be followed up.  But every child is uniquely different.  Your child may be on the autistic spectrum, or they may have some developmental delay, or they may have some traits of autism or another disorder.  But he is interacting with you and that means a much more positive outcome whatever happens (even if it is autism).  Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means that the child/adult can be affected severely or mildly (or anywhere inbetween).
At the moment you are worried sick at the prospect that your child is not 'as you expected' and the implications for the future that that holds.  But with time, as you learn more about your son you will see that he too will develop and learn and achieve things, you will feel more positive about the future.
At the moment you are just at the start of a very scary journey, which as you have said also makes you angry/sad and frustrated.  But lots of other parents have done this and are doing it, so you are not alone.
If it does turn out to be 'something' I would recommend finding a parent support group because you will get lots of information and emotional suppport.

        Definitely go to an expert.  I have a team of the best psychiatrists, psychoneurologists, and psychologists looking at my son and they are a bit stumped whether he is ASD or not.  He is what they call very borderline.  He is very smart.  His IQ is in the 98% - but htat really doesn't matter when you lack social kills.  He reminds us of Sheldon on the big Bang Theory.  

Am I upset that ehre is no definitive answer - not really.  We know his executive functioning is in the toilet and he has a very rigid vieew of the world - but all the ABA therapy we have down with him has worked wonders in our ability to function as a familyy.  He is definitely improving.

And all of those big reports all those doctors wrote - got us into a school were the staff was professionally trained to dela with his persosnality both emotionally and academically.

Many of the children in his school are exceptionally bright - but many still have trouble functioning when they graduate.  In fact, his school has just set up an agreement with a college so tht the supports are still in place if they want to attend college (ASD hava high dropout rate).

After three years, no one can definitely dx my son.  Right now it is technically ADHD, ODD, tic disorder and an unspecified mood disorder.  Many of the autism doctors feel that he is a little bit autistic but not full blown criteria,.  NYU is starting to move into researching this whole borderline area of children -- she just may be one of them.

My son almost has pragmatic speech down (he is good 90% of the time), is getting better at controlling his emotions when things aren't going his way, and is learning to be more flexible - but it si a process.  Be happy that she seems relatively normal - the more normal she is the better chances at a good outcvome.  My son never qualified for any services until we sued the state - and he was struggling so bad that we were afraid he was turning suicidal.  He had a bad incidence on Prozac - leading his psychiatrist (who specializes in Asperger's but is also a pharmacologist) to start thinking along different lines (as certain conditions react badly to SRRIs).  THese are what experts can help you sort out.  He may be bipolar (too young to tell),  but these are things they can monitor.

Now he is in a place that celebrates him.  They work on his strengths and his weaknesses.  He is so happy now that his anxiety levels are way down and he has made friends.  We truly thank all the professionals at the NYU Child Development Center that built the roadmapp for us to follow.  I think that the scope of some children''s problems need a professional who sees more of it than your average pediatrician.  Our pediatricians are kept informed but they acknowledge that it is best to get expert advice.  

It truly disturbes me that so many people on these boards rely on quicly done psycho-eds at their school or a quick checklist at the doctor's office.  There are definirely waiting room diagnosis (in my son's school they abound) but I am finding the more we get into this that there are so many shades of behavioral issues or neurological disorders.  What one parent regards as autisitic my actually be the symptom of many other conditions - or it may be autism.  THe dx isn't always as important as getting the right therapies for your child.  ASD gets you alot more help than ADHD or ED - so take it as a gift.  You can always have the paper work shredded when your child ages out of the system.

        I don't know how it works in the USA, but in the UK you get in touch with your local council and ask for details of all the schools that are Special Educational Needs or have Enhanced Resources (extra staff/funding) for pupils on the autistic spectrum and also find out if there is any entrance criteria.  Then you would make appointments to look round each one to see which was the most appropriate.  As your child has a number of diagnosis, is an Educational Psychologist involved who could also advise you?

Sometimes hand flicking near the face in the line of vision can be an indication of autism.  But you haven't raised that as a concern so I assume there were no speech delays or communication problems or throwing tantrums or sensory issues?

        My understanding is that they are using that type of system at his school at the moment.  But he still isn't getting it.  Even when we use something that motivates him he doesn't seem to be able to retrieve information and he gets very upset about it.  Sometimes he gives up trying to tell us something because he cannot access the words.  He says 'they float around in my brain'.  I don't think I would be able to use the motivation of the TV (although he loves TV), because if I had to stop him every 5 minutes he would have a meltdown every time and it usually takes him a fair amount of time (over an hour) to recover.
If that is the only type of thing that works, then I suppose we'll have to continue with that.  But I wondered if there is a specific problem that some people with autism have of not being able to access information regardless of the fact that he knows it.  There are times when something triggers information he has stored.  It might be something I say or something he sees and then he is like a recording and just replays an amazing amount of information.  But when he has finished and you ask him about it, he seems as surprised as everyone else as to how he knew that!
I wondered if he really doesn't recognise things 'visually', (and he isn't a visual learner) but somehow when he is given a choice of things he is able to bring in his ability of 'pattern recognition' to help him identify the correct answer?

        I think you are right and alot of the disruptive behaviour is down to Aspergers.  But that doesn't mean it is acceptable.  What it means is that he may need structure and supports to help him behave as well as structure and support so that he has different options other than a meltdown.  But I would also say that even adults with Aspergers have meltdowns and I remember one adult had posted his fear of having a meltdown and of being approached by a policeman.  He said that if, at that point of anxiety/stress, the policeman touched him he would probably retaliate and hit him back, with the obvious consequences of that!
You are right to say that breaking routines/rituals is going to cause a meltdown.  For them the world is quite a chaotic place with no understandable connections.  That is why they like routines/rituals because it them makes them able to predict what is going to happen.  If you change it they are again thrown into turmoil of not knowing what is going to happen.
I have heard of a system called 123 magic, which alot of families have used successfully for 'normal' children and those on the spectrum and with ADD/ADHD.  It provides the structure so that they can navigate through difficulties behaving more appropriately and it concentrates on rewarding and reinforcing positive behaviour instead of just punishment for bad behaviour.  The child with Aspergers needs to know what the boundaries are and the other family members (including other siblings) need to know what are the difficulties of Aspergers.  For example if your grandson has problems with transitions he needs the structure so that he is able to accept that the TV programme he is watching has finished and now it is someone elses turn to watch it.  If he has rituals/routines/obsessions then these have to be worked with.  You cannot try to stop/remove them because that will cause anxiety/stress/meltdowns etc.  So if a sibling is playing with something involving his obsession and it is driving him up the wall, the sibling has to know that is a no go area.
My son, who is on the spectrum, also explained to me that when they get emotional about something they are totally flooded with that sensation.  We are able to experience that sensation in relation to what has happened we are not completely overwhelmed by an emotion out of proportion to what has happened.  Secondly my son says he cannot stop the feeling.  So where we can quite quickly get our feelings and behaviour under control and therefore act appropriately they cannot.  It is overwhelming and it doesn't stop for a long time.  So, any effort he makes to control himself should be praised.  He should be shown some empathy eg.  I can see you are really upset/angry about ..... and I think you need some time to calm down.  Then they can have 5/10 minutes in a quiet place.  This is a different approach to being told you are naughty and are sent to your room.  You are recognising the difficulty and showing him how to cope ie. go somewhere quiet to calm down.  Then later you can talk about it with him and can use Social Stories to explain the situation because many times what we understand automatically is not obvious to the child.
Don't get too upset about words he uses (although he should be made to understand what words are unacceptable through social stories again).  When he says he hates you he is just speaking his mind without the social/communication insight to know how hurtful that is to you.  Most other children would also think those words, but know that it is socially inappropriate to say them.  But listen to what he says to understand the depth of what he is feeling as that will be an honest expression of how he is experiencing the emotion.

        My son hardly ever hand flaps, infact I only see it about once a week.  But he did use to spin as a toddler.  Apart from hand flapping your daughter could be showing signs of echolalia.  This is when questions/phrases said to the child are repeated back by the child.  Delayed echolalia is when a child repeats DVD/TV dialogue either to themselves or uses it as a form of communication.
My son also gave answers to questions 'off topic'.  This was (a) communication disorder - he simply did not know what I was asking him but knew I was expecting an answer from him.  So if we were reading a book and I asked him 'what is the man doing' (answer: washing the car), my son would say 'it is red' (the colour of the car in the book was red).  Or he used an echolalic response to my question.
My son also has empathy, sense of humour, theory of mind, appropriate facial expressions (although maybe not to a level of a 'normal' child).
It is quite possible to have autistic traits, but not enough of them in all the areas required for a clinical diagnosis.  But I think you do need to mention your concerns to professionals.

        Wow - you have a nice school.  My ASD kid sat in the principal's unlocked bathroom (he is gluten sensitive and was having a diarhea bout - he did ask the nurse to call us before it all escalated) for 2 hours (no one called us) and they called 4 cops and an ambulance to take him away.  We got a fabulous settlement which is paying for his private Asperger's School.

What the doctor says up top is very important.  My son's dx is still up for debate.  We have had ADHD, OCD, mood disorder (NYU doesn't give out the bipolar until later teenage years), ASD and Tourette's.  Honestly I couldn't give a hoot about the dx - we just needed to ascertain the services he needed.  We still have no real idea - he is just a kid who skirts alot of spectrums but fails to make full criteria on any of them.  The new school made all the difference and we are so grateful that these trained professionals (outside his large staff at NYU) know how to bring out the very best in these kids.

        My son also used to scratch his face, hit his face, bang his head, vomit whenever he got upset about something.  This is a communication problem both ways.  They find it hard to communicate with you and they cannot understand what you are saying to them.  Encourage short one/two word phrases together with signing or pictures.  A large part of the behaviour is their frustration.  Now my son is older and verbal and can tell me what upsets him and how he feels.  Interestingly, he also says that when he feels bad/upset/anxious etc that he cannot control it and stop feeling it.  So in some way they get flooded with their feelings and find it hard to bring them under control as well do.  But they do learn to cope better as they get older.
Having a predictable routine will help.  There may be problems with transitions eg. moving from one toy/subject/room to another.  Your child may be unable to do something, cannot communicate her need for help and therefore hits herself.  Or you could be asking her to do something/stop doing something and she cannot understand/comply.
Regarding sensory stuff, google Olga Bogdashina and read her article in Autism Today.  My son also has alot of sensory stuff, we have been referred to OT.  I have had him assessed for Irlen Syndrome and he wears the glasses which help alot.  I also have a pair of DIY ear defenders which he uses to screen out noise.  The problem with noise could be that it is loud/sudden/unpredictable or noises she cannot habituate to.  The glasses/ear defenders have given my son confidence/trust to do many things eg. go shopping etc.  As he is getting older (age 7) I always ask him if he needs them, but he is quite capable of refusing them.  If there is too much sensory stimulation this too will cause meltdowns.

        I found a book called ""Sensory Perceptual Issues in Autism and Aspergers"" by a woman called Olga Bogdashina very useful.  It is quite written in language you understand, but it is complex and sometimes you have to read over what you just read.  But it all made sense of the behaviours and responses I was seeing in my child.
At the back of the book there is also a long questionnaire which you can fill in to find out your childs sensory profile.  Again this is very useful because you can then see which sense is affected the most etc.  There are a number of professionals in the UK using this profile checklist, so I am confident that it is reputable.
Your son is still very young, but I still think you would be able to get a profile.  I completed it for my son and found that all of his senses were affected, but that his main problems were auditory and tactile.  I go over it again once a year to update it as obviously children change.
As well as explaining the sensory differences and how they interact, the book also goes over some coping strategies these children use either intentionally or automatically.
Eventhough you don't say your child has a diagnosis of autism, I think this book would still be relevant to children with sensory problems and no diagnosis.
I'm afraid I have no experience of hypotonia or hyperopic.
Hope that is useful.

I also suggest giving some sort of positive reinforcement for him complying with the routine.  Look into what is motivating and enjoyable for him.  For example, if he complies with step 1 of the routine he get a sticker.  If he gets 5 stickers, the next morning he can play the x-box (or other motivating activity)  for 20 minutes.   If he does not comply, no x-box.  This is just a general idea but you would need to modify it your situation.
In terms of additional training for you, I would look into Behavior Interventions for children with autistic spectrum disorder.

        Wow.  This sounds like a tough case.  If this child's mother is not on board with what you are trying to help this child learn, then it is a no win situation. My best recommendation to you would be to get his ""team"" together to discuss what is going on with him.  If that means the case manager, mobile therapist, or whoever is involved, they need to know and discuss this.

Another idea is for you to see how his school is handling his behaviors.  It should be beneficial for both home and school to deal with this boy's issues in the same manner.  Children with autism thrive in consistency.  If his mother sees that they use a schedule in school, she may be more likely to implement that at home.  Same may go for dealing with behaviors.

        I think you do have a cause for concern.  Children with autism show impairments in speech and language skills, impairments in social skills and odd or restricted behavior and interests.  Who did you schedule an appointment with, a doctor?  Your best bet would be to contact your local school district and request an evaluation to see if your child is eligible for special education services.  In PA, the district has 60 days to complete the evaluation.  I believe the federal law is 90 days.  That would be better than waiting 6 months.  You could call the district to find out the name of the person who takes such requests for a child who is 2 years (Early Intervention?).  It is better to put your request in writing.  Make sure that there is a Psychologist, Speech Therapist, Occupational Therapist, and a Special Education Teacher submitting information for the evaluation.

        We have been seeing a behavioral psycologist for a year now who diagnosed him with AS before he was hospitalized. He is failing at school this year in the third grade. I started the procces of requesting testing for special ed services again as he was released after he completed the pre-k level. They tested him for dyslexia as per my request and found that he was. I was concerd as he turns letters and numbers around and words verbally as well as written. At home he refuses to do what he is asked without a fight and total meltdown. He tells me no all of the time, I don't want to. I get looks that could kill, and he hits himself. All of this is over small tasks like picking up toys or doing homework even if I help him. My husband thinks I should whip him for everything, I think I should chose my battels. The point is, it is causing problems all around in our home. How do we deal with his refusals to do task, fit throwing and meltdowns in a way that we can avoid those things and yet get him to do what we want and exhibit the behaviors we desire?

        Request that your school do a NESPY (you will probably need permission - we paid for it ourselves).  We have had three well known doctors and one well known Asberger's expert look at him - there is no consensus - but he sounds like my son.  He is going to a school with Asberger's kids and loves it.  He did nothing for three yers in school (he got N/A on his report cards) but he excelled in reading (he reads on a college level) and he is pretty good and math.  He is highly disorganized and can't write a good essay w/o going off topic.    Anyway, his school challenges him academically and he has made friends (though I would give him a F in social skills).  Anyway, the testing helped and the neuropsychologist gave us a lot 
of great ideas.  I also think he has a touch of Asbergers (his voice is pretty normal and he through the docs on his inferential skills -but one of them attribitutes some of the more surprising results to his IQ).  But on the executive dysfunction tests he came in around 10%.  I am glad that he is not oppositional - mine is and it can be a nightmare.

Hire a child advocate.  It ,akes all the difference in finding out what provisions can be made for your son - school social workers and IEP teams are pretty closed mouthed on your rights.

        I think pediatricians screen at 18 and 24 months for autism.  A couple web sites I found helpful were:
http://www.firstsigns.org 
http://www.info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism/pddinfo.html

Concerns many parents have about autism is if their children do not respond to their own names, cannot follow directions, have repetitive behaviors like arm flapping or rocking, walk on their toes, stack and line up their toys, play inappropriately with their toys, don't socialize with others and have limited eye contact.  Also if children don't hit developmental delays like rolling over, sitting, standing, walking, babbling, smiling and laughing, etc.  My daughter hit a lot of hers on the late side, but I was concerned at 24 months when she still didn't say any words.  At the time I didn't realize there was a difference between speaking and receptive language.  She didn't even respond to her own name, but I just thought that was part of the speech delay.  I probably should have questioned it with the pediatrician earlier, but my husband didn't say his first word until he was 2.  He is not autistic, he was just late in talking.  His first words were all numbers and he didnt' say mama or daddy until he was 3.  But then he was reading at age 3 and then caught up completely with everything, without any therapies (I don't think therapy was done earlier back in the 1970s).  He went on to college and then to grad school and has a PhD from Yale.  15 months is also a little on the early side, but personally, I'd just keep a track of it, address everything with the pediatrician, and stay on top of it, and try not to worry too much.  Plus if you stress out, your son might pick up on it and feel undo pressure to perform (i.e. speak).  Oh, and terrible twos start around 15 to 18 months, so maybe he's just starting a little early with the tantrums.  I guess with autistic children, the why of the tantrums is a clue.  My daughter had a meltdown when we rearranged the furniture in our house.  We had to move it back to original position.  She has meltdowns when anything in her routine is changed.  Autistic children generally like routines and things to be the same in their day to day activities.

Seriously, if you have concerns, address them with the pediatrician.  Especially if he's missing other milestones or is not social.  And if he's speech delayed, there is a wonderful 0 to 3 program that is government subsidized, that deals with lots of delay issues.  I think for just speech delays he probably wouldn't qualify until 24 months or so unless there are other things going on.  Also boys are generally later than girls to start talking.  Good luck.  Raising children is difficult, no matter what the issues.

For few weeks I give him Pediasure every day and those or the days I get good remarks. I gave a month break and started Pediasure again. the results are same.

        I understand your fears, because we all have them with our special needs children.  There is no way to say how much your son will improve, but he is miles ahead of others because he has you for a Mom who appears to be trying everything she can to help him!  Hats off to you.  I will never understand the people who bury their head in the sand & refuse to even consider their child may have a ""condition"" for fear of labeling them.  Good luck on your journey, and know that you are not alone.

        I have a 10 year old daugther with Asperger's, who was in trouble in preschool.  She was never violent, but wouldn't do what was asked of her, and yelled & screamed (she still does this).  It is so hard for these kids because they are so smart, & so bored with school.  Medications would work for about 2 weeks on my daugther, then she was back to her normal self.  I also didn't feel comfortable giving her the medication at such a young age.  I went to the school when she was 4 & told them she was reading at a 2nd grade level, was IQ tested at the top 1% of the population, and will not sit at a desk at school.  At that time, they really didn't know anything about Asperger's at my school, so they pooh poohed me, said I read to her a lot as a child & that is why she could read, & told me they wouldn't do anything different with her than any other kid.  Well, I knew that wasn't going to work, so I ended up homeschooling her until 3rd grade, when we finally figured out through her pediatrician that she had Asperger's.  We went back to the school & they then tested her & agreed, so she was able to receive special services then.  She is now in the 6th grade & not doing well at all (behaviorally).  Our school transferred her to another school after the Christmas break because they couldn't deal with her, & the new school, even though they have a program supposedly for Aspie's (there is only 1 other Aspie in the class), is not doing so well either.  I hate to sound like a downer here, but please know that you are not alone.  Since I was with my daughter 24/7 for the first 7 years of her life, I read every parenting book, tried every trick offered, was constantly accused of not disciplining her enough & that is why she is like she is, & was living in a constant state of extreme stress.  When I went to the school I felt that there were no answers for her.  They (the experts as they call themselves) made me feel like an insuperior idiot & they could ""fix"" her.  Now they have tried all their ""tricks"" and she is showing worse behaviors than ever.  So here I am back to where I was when I sent her to school thinking there are no answers for my daugther, & wondering what the heck we can do with her now.  I work outside of the home now & am not in a position to homeschool her again.  Sorry if I am going on & on, but I want you to know there are people out there that do know how you feel.  Unfortunately, we are far & few between.  Good luck to you.

I have Asperger's and so does my youngest daughter and your story could have been written by me when my daughter was ten.

Mine stopped bed wetting at nearly thirteen. Everything else you are saying is just like my daughter. 

Encourage her in whatever her special interest is and just remember that she will grow up one day, whether she talked and played, or just walked around at recess. 

Love her for the unique person she is and try to keep her bedroom a calm relaxing place where she can de-stress from her day of having to be with other people. Good luck.

        Dear Jennifer,

I have been at this for 4 years now.  We are a little bit closer - he may have a mild case of Asbergers - but the label is not as imortant as the treatment.  Not all children are ""waiting room diagnosis"" as one doctor likes to say.

It can be frustrating - we have spent over $25,000 ourselves.  You may want to look into participating in some studies.  We have done one or two and they tell you the test results.  Many major medical centers are involved.  We got a $4,000 celiac test done for free (he was gluten intolerant), free IQ and autism testing, and other things.  NYU was going to send ABA specialists to help him in class for feww (until the teacher shot it down).  He is going to be going to school soon - defiitely get all your doctors to write reports becuase it sounds like he is going to need an extensive IEP.  Sometimes family counseling and therapy can be added on and paid for by the state.  You are better than me - I hid my head in the sand until he was in first grade because he was quite a clever lad.  We were hoping he would grow out of it - he didn't - but it is much better now.  

Sam takes Tenex too.  It isn't always a panacea but it does help.

        Dear Jennifer,

I have been at this for 4 years now.  We are a little bit closer - he may have a mild case of Asbergers - but the label is not as imortant as the treatment.  Not all children are ""waiting room diagnosis"" as one doctor likes to say.

It can be frustrating - we have spent over"

        We live in Iowa do you have any suggestions of who to see. I had an appt. with the U of I Center for Disabilities but his child Psych doctor found out and had them refer me back to child psych at the U of I. I had a local appt. where I live and the intake social worker asked where I have been seen and I told her and then I was refused services and recommended to go back to the child psych. This is where my frustration is at right now.
He has been medicated and was so for a very long time but I was not happy that I kept getting the ADD diagnosis and that was all and that he is a typical preteen.
So if there is any doctors that you can give me their names that are in the state of Iowa I am all open. Thank you for your response!

        Hi,
i have a 4 yr old mildly autistic spectrum girl.  I remember back when she was 3, I wondered the same thing about  how she will be when she is an adult.  All I can say is that the changes from 3-4 were incredible with my daughter.  We took her off of the dialy antibiotics that she was on, and got her on some probiotics and vitamins and the change has been amazing.  i bet your son will start changing soon.  Does he also have sensory processing dysfunction?  I know that shut my daughter down completely, especially in school, she would jsut go into her own world because it was too loud at her school.
Does he have any stomach issues?

        Hi,
sounds a lot like my child who is now 4.  when she was 2 she could do 48 piece puzzles and knew the alphabet but could not stand hugs and was sort of lost.  she does not really have a speech delay, but a delay in other areas.  At 3 she was dx with PDD-NOS  ""pervasive development disorder, not otherwise specificed"" because she did not fit nicely into any category.  She did not have above normal/normal language skills which would have given her the asperger's dx i think.
I would go with your gut.  Forget those docs and go to another.  If I had it to do over again, i woudl forget the developmental pediatrician and take her straight to a DAN! doctor.  (defeat autism now)
It will work out, but do follow your gut.  You know your child better than anyone else.  And, you know that time is important here, and if you get treatment sooner than later it could make a huge difference.

I'm sure each childs condition is different but have you ever thought about adding supplements, Vit B-12, probiotic, Fisl oil, Whole food vitamins etc. Our American Food industry is loaded with chemically altered stuff which also does play a major role in these so called for neurological disorders in kids thesedays.
Three websites to look into with great info are :
www.mercola.com
www.garynull.com
www.majidali.com

        My son, now 13 years-old, has dyspraxia. The first signs were lack of speech. He was three years old and would only make nonsensical words. I was told by doctors that there was nothing wrong. To say the least, they were wrong.

After an evaluation, I was able to put him in speech therapy through the school district. It was a miracle. He slowly started with words, then sentences etc. He also received speech therapy through our medical insurance. I only wished that I had done it sooner.

The best help is therapy. Your medical insurance should be able to help.

The most important thing is to start as soon as possible.

        Hello Dr. Macdonald,
Thank you very much for  your reply.  I looked on the website and there are no BCBA doctors near us.  But, about 100 miles away there are about a half dozen, so we will try one of them.  THANKS!

So, we have one more question. The day after I posted this about her very challenging behavior, she started acting happier.  We have had about 5 days now of excellent behavior.  She is talking, listening, playing,  having fun, and just being almost a typical kid.  We have actually had outings without much screaming.  She still throws tantrums over things but it is a tolerable amount and they only last a minute. Maybe like a typical 4 year old almost.  It is like we can talk some sense to her right now.  The thing is, she cycles like this.  When we are in a bad cycle no amount of any reinforcing, sticker charts, etc does anything for her.  It is like she is just totally out of it, and screaming most of the time.  Then, it changes and she is great for a while.  This is one reason we thought maybe bi-polar?   And, the fact that a clinician that was at our house and witnessed soem of the behavior said her anger was extreme, and it could be bi-polar.  But, then we have these wonderful times like right now.  Of course, we look for anything that caused the good times, or the bad cycle and there is nothing we can think of.  recently, we started Super Nu vitamins and we are hoping they are helping.  At least that would give us some control over something and be able to help her.  However, we know logically that the bad cycle is probably coming again and we should not get our hopes up.

thanks for listening...
