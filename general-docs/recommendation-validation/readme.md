# To-do
---
- Solicit feedback from Fellows to assess quality and clarity.
- Integrate any other points that are not covered but seem to occur commonly.

# Future work
---
- For recommenders, it would be great to have a notebook or notebooks covering algorithms.  It would be great to have some non-standard options too.
