1,Inappropriate Masterbation Down Syndrome,"
        It is common for children and adolescents with Down Syndome to show many different forms of self-stimulator behavior, includig masturbation. It is important for you and the other other adults involved in your son's care to begin to help him to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate forms of stimulation and situations in which this behavior is appropriate. Allowing him to touch himself in public will limit his opportunity to be included in certain activities and settings and may limit opportunities for appropriate social interaction. If he rubs himself in public, either against an object or person, interrupt this behavior and direct him toward an appropriate activity. More importantly, try to be sure that there is some appropriate alternative easily available to him at all times. If there is nothing appropriate to do he will find some way to stimulate himself. If you have any concerns about his interactions with children please do supervise him carefully and seek in-person professional consultation.

        This sounds like an extremely challenging situation. As a disclaimer I need to note that no responsible therapist can diagnose over the internet or give you a prescription for the best course of action.  However, I would suggest you obtain immediate therapeutic assistance and insist, if you can, that this child get help.  I wouldn’t take any risks with this case.

        Your e-mail address was blocked out.   There are no other Asperger children in his school, in fact the staff never even heard of Asperger.  I have been providing them with BOOKS to educate them on Aspergers.  He lives in an area where there are no other families.  He has numerous problems riding the bus, as he is teased.   His last Suicide attempt was thwarted by the teacher on the playground; but now claims he will not be using his shoes laces for that purpose again.  But when a meltdown starts, one doesn't truly know how the child will react.   I think what they need are some outside activities, like Karate or (?) to be with other children and not have his head stuck in a video game or TV show, but learn to interact with other children his age.  But his Dad, doesn't want to be bothered with anything that requires him to leave the house. I sometimes wonder who needs the help more the child or the Dad.  Grandmother1941

        I don't know about the suicuidal tendincies but as a mother and professional educator of autistic children I find the last palce they want to be is in the playground let alone a playground where he gets bullied and teased. Perhaps the best palce for him  at school is in a computer room or the like.  Aspergers/autitis children struggle most with the friendship stuff.  and a thought to add a ""2 person""  computer game with other children  is still a version of ""friendship""...Some of the clinical pscho;ogists are now highly recommending that these children be given time in quieter areas at lunch time because they just don't cope as well as others and by lunch time tyhey are passed being ""social"" and do more harm than good to themselves and others in the playground.

8,Suicidal 8 yr. old Asperger grandson,"
        My 9 year old son was diagnosed with asperger's at age 8 when he also tried to strangle himself at school with his shoelaces. He has made at least 4 suicide attempts since last summer, with his latest one happening today during a meltdown. As soon as my son begins having a meltdown he tries to hurt himself, just like your grandson has been doing. I put my son in counseling when he was 6, and really nothing helped. The counselor kept telling me that she knew that there was something wrong but she didn't know what it was. He was diagnosed after his 3rd suicide attempt. The one thing that has seemed to help with his meltdowns are his meds. The meltdowns are much less frequent and are not as intense when he has them (except for today), however if his father does not accept the diagnosis, the meds will be impossible as well. I am not sure as to what suggestions I can give you because I am too at a loss in my own situation and was here looking for answers.

        I have a 10 year old daughter with Asperger's who talks about wanting to be dead, but never has attempted it (thankfully).  Yes, many people with Asperger's suffer from depression, too.  Can you blame him?  It sounds like you understand about Asperger's, so I'm sure you can imagine how difficult it must be for him with a Dad who does not understand him, or is even willing to try, no teachers who understand, the teasing of other kids (who really don't understand!), and the stress levels these kids are under from every day things--noise, lights, etc.  I feel for you, and your grandson, as I think you may be right--that he may succeed next time.  I would say contact Child & Protective Services, but there is no guarantee he would end up with someone who understands there, either.  Are you able to take him in?

        That sort of behavior isn't uncommon in typically developing children, so I'm not sure that you have a reason to be worried about autism.  The other piece of the disorder is a deficit in social interaction, so keep an eye out for that.  Ultimately, if you're worried, it's best to have him assessed and start getting services early.

How is he doing in day care ? do you know an inclusive school near by ? one thing is that in early age a very quiet baby can be more bad news! now to help you we need more details about like Jason said, his social skills, walking, crawling, pre speech fine motoring(ex capacity to play with small object toys) eye contact. In the mid while he like patterns so do give him regular time to eat, bath, sleep find out what activity comes him down, be open minded inventive and keep your eyes open.

        This type of behavior is sometimes connected.  I have found that in setting his routine for each day,let him play in the shower.  Support this by giving him praise because he observed the house rules.  Make sure you tell him he may only show this type of behavior in the bathroom or in private as in bed.  Each time he behaves improperly, you must tell him that he broke the house rule and take away something he loves to do...with exception of things he must use 2 hands for ;-)

19,what the chances of have two autistic childern?,"
        This is a common question in any family with someone diagnosed with autism.  The strongest causal evidence points to genetics playing a role and children with a sibling with autism are more likely to have autism than children who don't have a sibling with autism.  The actual percentage chance is unknown at this point.  I can tell you that, in the vast majority of cases, the sibling doesn't end up with an autism diagnosis and I've worked with many many families for which only a single child has autism.

21,just concerned,"
        Unfortunately, the answer to this question is unknown.  There are strong genetic correlates with autism.  People with an identical twin with autism are much more likely to also have autism than people with a fraternal twin with autism and people with a sibling with autism are more likely to have autism than the general population is.  That being said, the vast majority of children born to parents who have siblings with autism do not have autism.  There is no mathematical, exact probability that is known at this point for what you are asking.  If at any point you have concerns, seek out an evaluation.  The earlier a diagnosis is given, the better the prognosis, and a solid decision about diagnosis can often be made as early as two years of age.

        Its possible that your child may have Asperger's because it's biological uncle has it, but at the same time Asperger's could be a random gene mutation. Asperger's is interesting like that and could be misdiagnosed as ADHD. When my dad learned from my mom after getting an evaluation, that I had mild Asperger's as well as mild ADHD, my dad finally understood why I didn't learn well from him, he said that I had to have gotten the Asperger's from him, blaming himself, but it may not have been inherited. I have mild Asperger's because I had a mother who was willing to help me, and according to a Psychologist, I'm one of the few lucky ones who have kind of 'outgrown' it, thanks to my mother. But as I said, Asperger's is either inherited or just plain random in gene mutation I think. So don't worry about it too much. Everything will be OK I'm sure. Good luck with your baby! ;)

        While it's difficult to give a diagnosis from a description alone, if you have concerns, have your son assessed.  Your pediatrician should be able to refer you to a professional in your area with the expertise needed to assess your son for a diagnosis.  This is often the first step toward receiving services, so the sooner this is done, the better.

26,worried my son is autistic,"
        I try to read books with him but he is only interested for a short while before he wants to move on to something else. Same with movies/tv.

He plays with us by chasing, wrestling, tickling, and hand clap games. He likes to play catch and basket ball.

He does try to get our attention with his activity.  

 

A lot of times he brings us things like a toy car or some other object and gives it to us while ''talking''. I don't know what he wants us to do with it  usually because I have no idea what he is trying to say unless it's something obvious like a ball. He often wants to share his food with us. He takes his spoon or whaever it is he is eating and holds it to our mouths going ''ahhh'' (open). Sometimes he will go  and get food when he isn't even eating and tries to feed us, not wanting to eat himself I don't know why he does that .If we accept his offer he goes ''Mmmmm yum''

When he does something he is proud of he  looks at us and claps his hands going ''yaaay!''. If we do something he likes ( like making a basket while plaing basketball) he will either cap and say yay or gives us a high five. Mostly he just claps, though.

Are these  joint attention?


The thing is he is very hyperactive. He cannot sit still. He is constantly on the go. Running, jumping playing very loudly. He babbles to himself very loudly and is always squealing and laughing loudly while doing this. He likes to run a lot. Sometimes he will run back and forth through the living room and wont stop until he is asked to or he is out of breath. This is the only repetitive behavior he has.

He also likes to climb things. The stairs, furniture, etc. Once he used a crutch leaning against a bookshelf as a ladder to get some candy I put on the top. If he wants it he'll find a way to climb if I won't give it to him.  I have read this is a symptom...

 

 

I don't know how he is socially. His social interaction with others has been extremely limited. He doesn't know anyone his age. Except for a cousin he has been around a couple of times, he has never been around another child. He did seem to take an interest his cousin though.  He doesn't meet strangers often. I think when he had his preschool eval a few weeks ago, that was his first time meeting someone new in many many months. Or actually, seeing anyone besides me, my So and my farther in months. My S.O and I mostly keep to ourselves.  He is shy and I am also shy. It is aso hard for me to find friends because I  can't relate to most people my age ( 24 ) but  I can't relate to older mothers, either. This has led me to be very isolated and after being isolated for so long I am finding it very difficult to go out and make new friends... I am wondering if this might be aprt of our son's problem.

        I think this is less a diagnosis issue and more of an issue with seeking out help for your son in the areas in which he struggles.  There are many, many people who struggle with making and maintaining relationships or in the area of personal communication.  These are skills that can be worked on and real progress can be made.  If you are worried about this, seek out a professional with experience in this area and make it a priority.

32,Anxiety with school,"
        Certainly continue to keep in touch with your pediatrician about the issue.  We sometimes observe self-induced vomiting in children with autism, and perhaps that is the case here.  Generally speaking, the goal for treating these sorts of transition problems is to make things really great for the child during the transition and upon arriving at school (i.e., make the trip and arrival a real treat for her).  If this continues, follow up with the school, consider adding a IEP objective to address it, and pursue behavior analytic services to help.

        Unfortunately, no.  There are no shots and no medications that can improve social skills.  The issues she's facing need to be on her IEP and part of her daily educational programming.  There's no quick fix here, and no short-term solution, but kids can make real and meaningful progress with effective clinical and educational programming.

        You are right on target with focusing on the needs of your son.  If he could use some help with social interaction, make sure he gets it!  The diagnosis is often the road to an IEP and making sure that appropriate services are in place and the services themselves matter a lot more than the diagnosis.  Based on your description, I can't tell if a diagnosis is appropriate or not.  Certainly, if you feel like a diagnosis isn't appropriate, go ahead and seek a second opinion.

        No one can give you an exact probability on that.  While there are correlations within families, perhaps an increased likelihood of having multiple children with autism in a single family, it is impossible to say what the probability is.  The vast majority of children do not have autism even if other family members do.

        This escalation in behavior problems as the child ages is quite common in children diagnosed with autism.  Families often reach a point where they are unable to handle the situations by themselves.  I don't see any reason to suspect that this is a reaction to your family situation on the part of your son.  You need to seek out professional behavioral help for your son.  Continue to pursue diagnosis and seek out a board-certified behavior analyst in your area.  These behavior problems are absolutely treatable but find a professional who has the appropriate expertise to help with your situation.

        As far as a safe dose, this is a question that should be answered by your pediatrician.  Regarding the effectiveness, I'm not sure what you are looking for.  There is no empirical support for vitamin and mineral therapies for autism.  If this is addressing some medical need, that's one thing, but don't expect an improvement in the child's learning or behavior associated with an autism diagnosis.

43,My 4 year old plays with his poop!,"
        ZapCat is right about this, and you are on the right track.  Start with an autism evaluation by trained professionals.  Fecal smearing and play is behavior that is sometimes observed in both typical kids and those diagnosed with an intellectual disability like autism.  It can be effectively treated with a consistently implemented behavior management plan.  
Typically this entails special rewards the child can earn for going X amount of time (a day or week, for example) without exhibiting the behavior.  If your child is hiding it, that's actually a good sign.  It means he realizes that you don't want him doing it, which is an important step.  These sorts of treatments are often easily included in larger-scale behavior management systems.  For example, sticker charts or point systems where the child is working toward earning something valued for a variety of good behaviors.  If you aren't getting good traction with treatment, look up a board certified behavior analyst in your area.  These types of behavior problems can definitely be treated.

anyway, i do therapy with autistic children and have witnessed some of what you are describing. we call your child's poop playing ""fecal smearing"", and is something that is not exceptionally uncommon for some autistic children to exhibit. without seeing your child it isn't easy to say one way or the other, but if you are concerned i would encourage you to ask the child's pediatrician about the behaviors and see if they can recommend someone for you to talk to (psychologist/ psychiatrist) who would be able to give your child an evaluation. if your child does lie somewhere on the autism spectrum early intervention seems to help the child be successful. hope this helps.

I expressed my concerns which were the same as yours (being picked on in school) and the school nurse referred him to a paediatric doctor who gave me a routine to follow and I filled out a drink diary. The reason they saidy son was doing this was due to a small bladder. After following the doctors advice my son was completely dry within 3 months or so. 

Your situation sounds very similar my son gets so into something that he didn't realize he needed to go, it sounds strange but I was told to give him 500mls water 3 times a day and he needed to drink it all. Also I was told he had to have a drink at bedtime. This really made a difference. I hope this has helped, and I hope you get the help you need.

        My daughter was diagnosed since age 2. She is now 6. Her behavior is not going to change. It won get better until she gets to her teens. Even then she will still show signs of the condition. The ST OT AND PT are good for her to get a basic understanding of what is ok behavior. I refuse to use medication on my child. The condition is part of who she is and I wouldn't want her to be anything but herself. I have made peace with somethings that I will have to sacrifice and do. My husband is a grown man in his 30's and he has been living with it his whole life. The only bad thing is the impulse control issues. Its hard to manage. Some of his decision making is done on a whim and they are not the best choices. But he has led a fulfilling life. I watch over him like i do my daughter but it is possible for your child to live without so much worry on your part. My advise is to find something that interest her. Like my child likes to sing, draw, and watch tv but certain shows. She can't get enough of the learning shows, you know, the ones where they ask the child to participate like Dora, super why, etc. so i let her watch those as a treat fir doing homework on her own, reading, and doing her chores. Then she sings along. And i ask her to draw me something she learned about. It keeps her occupied and her behavior had improved. These activities leave very little room for her to get into something else. The problem with this condition is that people with it cannot sit still. So find something that will always keep her on her toes. My husband is a chef at a restaurant that never uses the same menu. So there us definitely hope.

we opted to go off all medication.  after years of fighting for him in 'acceptable' ways, we decided on a different approach.  we've gone to a mostly vegan diet, eliminating pretty much all processed foods (sounds weird, i know, but i now think it's less radical than life-long meds), and we've started meditating.  we sought out a local meditation group and, although it was slow- and rough-going at first, it has proven the most beneficial of all.  he's able to be quiet internally now, and it reflects externally.  his focus and drive are there, his anxiety and irritability are nearly gone and no melt downs in a long time.  also, it's given him such a sense of personal accomplishment and has really built up his self-esteem.  he's a much happier person.  there are books and research out there showing the benefit to the autistic brain... but i will say i've also benefited a great deal internally from the practice.

65,Clapping Waving Pointing,"
        Hello Ellen,
Based on your description your son's social-emotional development seems to be proceeding very well. He shows multiple signs of social engagement and relatedness to other people. It is important that he shows joint attention by looking at something that you are pointing at. This indicates that he is able and willing to share in your interest. It seems that he has not yet achieved the skill of imitating new fine-motor movements. Please keep in mind that developmental timelines vary widely from child to child. In addition, boys often develop their fine-motor skills a bit later than girls. I think there is no reason for concern right now. If these abilities do not emerge by 15-18 months, or if you notice any other delays in motor skills, its worth consulting with your pediatrician and an occupational therapist.
Good luck!

        While it is common to find psychotropic medication prescribed to children diagnosed with autism-spectrum disorders, they can have serious side effects and the data supporting their use is not overwhelmingly strong (long term prognosis for success for these medications is entirely unknown).  Because of the methodology used in these studies, we aren't able to predict ahead of time who is a good candidate for which medication.  This results in the decision making about the medications being essentially a very long trial and error process (and, in many cases, children do better off of medication altogether).  My recommendation is that you focus your energy in examining the clinical programming your grandson is receiving.  These behavior problems can reliably be treated through behavior analytic intervention.  Make sure he is receiving strong educational and behavior analytic services, where the professionals will explain the interventions to you and show you the data evaluating your grandson's progress.  It is often an excellent and reasonable long-term goal to have the child off of psychotropic medication altogether once he or she has started responding to behavioral intervention.

        Sounds to me like you are already doing a great job!  As you know, many individuals with autism have significant deficits in communication skills, both in how they express themselves, and how well they understand what is being said to them.  So, in general, when you are speaking to these friends, you might try to not speak too quickly, and not use complicated words that they may not understand.  If they seem to not understand what you are saying, you might try pairing your words with some simple gestures, as these may serve as additional cues to help them understand.  If these people sometimes engage in behaviors that are inappropriate, try to be accepting of them.  Some people with autism engage in behaviors that we might deem inappropriate, but they may actually be very adaptive for someone who has significant skill deficits.

I guess the bottom line is, treat these individuals with the same degree of respect that you would expect people to treat you with!  Thanks so much for your question, and best of luck in the future.

        You don't have to worry about vaccines (at all).  That notion has been debunked in several, multi-national studies.  It also turns out that the person who came up with the idea falsified his data and has since been universally discredited.  As a parent, you have the right to delay or refuse vaccination but the autism link is false and you end up putting your child at risk for serious diseases.  In the overwhelming majority of cases people with the family linkages to autism that you describe have typically developing children.  My advice is to relax and enjoy this period of your life.  If you end up noticing issues later, deal with them at that point, but you have no cause to be concerned right now.

        This is a study in which effects were seen for parents spending time with their children, interacting with various types of stimuli.  Generally speaking, environmental enrichment has been around for a long time.  What we know is that time with your child playing and teaching can be beneficial.  The most effective applications involve integrating play time with learning about new things.  I would advocate for doing more than merely exposing your child to an array of stimuli.  Very few studies have suggested that the exposure alone does anything, and the scientific support of sensory integration in general is extremely weak, but enriching an environment and arranging new, fun interactive and learning activities can have nice outcomes.

75,A lot of unanswered questions,"
        I don't think being patient is the right call here.  Continue actively pursuing any medical issues your son might have and make sure he is receiving high-quality educational services as well.  In a sense, his particular diagnosis (whether it be an ASD or not) is much less relevant than the particular educational challenges that he is facing.  As he transitions into school make sure that he has an IEP and that the school system is providing services to address his needs.  The physiological issues might be out of your control but making sure that he gets the help he needs to maximize his learning and potential are not.  The sooner early, intensive behavioral intervention begins the better the prognosis for long-term success.

81,Not sure about my son,"
        That's one of the things that throws us for a loop. He's not hyper-social (his sister is), but he seems fairly normal interacting with other kids. He does tend to do small-group or individual activities on the playground at school, but has a few good friends he's made and will play with them for a long time when he's with them (1st grade, btw).

He's well-liked by teachers and other other parents. Very well-behaved. Top grades, but not crazy-genius smart. Just works hard on his homework. Once he sets his mind to something, he gets good at it. Does crave order and routine - he gets more awkward the more he's in unfamiliar territory. Very cautious kid. Has color-blindness in case this is relevant. 

What kind of therapy is available? What is typical long-term prognosis? Many thanks!

        Hi Ben, I've just read your post. 
I agree with the other comment, it sounds like possible Aspergers, maybe not a severe case but it sounds like there are some symptoms of it. 
Try keeping a diary of what specifically triggers his 'melt down' usually children with Aspergers cannot cope with change, they like to know exactly what's going on and when! Regarding the name he calls a dog, that is also fairly normal in Aspergers, rather than thinking about what they're saying, they will just say it, without understanding why they've said it in the first place.
Depending on his age, his school should offer some support on this, if not, u can request that he is referred for observation. Hopefully then, he will get the addition support that is needed and you will be able to find out more info!

        Autism-spectrum disorders are diagnosable much before the onset of puberty and there is not good evidence that their presence or absence is related to puberty (i.e., there are not cases of people who are developing typically and then attain an autism-spectrum disorder during puberty).  That being said, I strongly recommend that you regularly see a behavioral or mental health professional.  It sounds like you're having some difficulties and all of them sound treatable.

89,Older fathers,"
        I think what I would recommend most, besides suggesting that you not worry about this so much, is to simply observe your child closely during the first year of life, and see if there are any signs that might suggest that he or she has autism (e.g., not making eye contact with you, never smiling at you).  If you have concerns, talk to your pediatrician and see if your child can be screened by someone with expertise in diagnosing autism in very young children.  If it turns out that your child does have autism, it is crucial that early intensive behavioral intervention be started, as the evidence is clear that the earlier and stronger you intervene (using applied behavior analysis as treatment), the outcomes are very encouraging, and some children have even lost their autism diagnosis after a number of years of intervention.  The keys, though, are starting early, and having intervention provided by someone with expertise in using applied behavior analysis with young children with autism--ideally, a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA).  You can find a registry of BCBAs in your area at www.bacb.org.

Best of luck!

        It's really not possible to tell whether the head shakes are indicative of any underlying issues - you would need to take her to see a doctor to determine the cause.  Before going to the doctor, if would probably be helpful for you to get more information on when the head shaking happens (does it happen only under specific conditions, or across lots of different activities?), how often it happens (take note of the number of times per day), whether you can interrupt it (if you call his name while he's shaking his head, does he respond?), etc.

95,Which medication is better?,"
        Every child responds differently to medication, so there is no way to definitively answer the question.  However, the two medications are of entirely different classes and might be expected to change behavior through slightly different mechanisms.  You should ask your pediatrician (or the prescribing doctor) what to expect from each medication in terms of both benefits and side effects, including how long it might take to fully evaluate whether a medication works and how to determine whether it is working (hopefully through direct evaluation of the frequency and intensity of behavior). 

It’s important to note that medication alone may not effectively manage your son’s behavior.  If you aren’t already consulting with a Behavior Analyst, I’d suggest that you do so.  A Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) can help you determine the situations that trigger this type of behavior and how to safely address the behavior in the long run.  The BACB website has a local service provider directory at: http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html.    It seems likely that if his behavior is this bad at home that he is having problems at school, too.  In this case, you should consult with your school to determine what types of services he is getting there and whether home support is an option.

It is for sure possible that autistics may have a different EEG pattern, but it does not exist enough science yet to support it and so such use and measure of EEG does not exist at a serious clinical level but may be used serious in research. For that reason only the standard and valid use of EEG was taken into account when I was tested and that standard and valid test did not have any implication for my autism diagnosis.

        Although TBI can cause a variety of behavioral changes and learning delays, it sounds like your son has a very classic presentation of autism. I think it’s very unlikely that the fall was responsible.  At this point, it’s most important to focus on his treatment – early intervention is key to achieving the best outcome.  If you haven’t already started intervention services for him, you should speak with your pediatrician to get referrals for the necessary services (hopefully, in-home or school early intervention services by a behavior analyst, and possibly a speech and language pathologist if needed).

101,is my 2years son normal or he have autism,"
        Hi! My little boy was diagnosed with autism at two and a half. He is and has always been Very loving and affectionate. He has very good eye contact when it comes to things he enjoys or wants. He definitely noticed when we leave the room, in fact at times, he cries. He has no aggression and never tantrums. At 2, he had several 2 word phrases, he could count to 20 and cite his ABC's but there were a few things about him that were very unusual. Here is a list: 

- he did not point with his index finger 
- he did not shake his head no or nod yes
- he could label every number and letter, but he could not answer yes or no questions 
- he memorized books word for word and could recite them when he saw them
- he had no pretend play 
- he seldom responded to his name 
- he communicated only to make his needs met, he never communicated to chat or share
- he lined up his toys and loved to examine objects up close
- if it came to choosing between a colourful teddy and a cellphone, he chose the cellphone. 
- he flapped his arms when he was excited. 
- he couldn't follow instruction, not even ""bring to mommy""
- there were times, I would talk to him and it was like he was deaf and couldn't hear. 

Autism can be diagnosed as early as 18 months and it is usually easily diagnosed at 2. If he does have similar symptoms as my guy, I would definitely get him checked if possible. And if you google ""Floor Time"" therapy, that's a really good technique you can use to help him while you are waiting for diagnosis. I had to wait several months for my sons assessment and by the time we went, just by using that technique for a few hours a day, he'd greatly improved.

102,Asperger's Syndrome and Gun Owner,"
        Asperger's syndrome is not a disorder that specifically makes someone more inclined toward violence.  It is, however, a learning disorder and individuals with Asperger's may have a more difficult time learning how to handle stressful situations in an appropriate manner.  There are a couple of important things to understand for someone in your situation or for anyone who has firearms in the home and an individual with disabilities who might potentially access them.  One, having firearms in the home drastically increases the likelihood of firearm related injury or death.  The owning, use of, or access to firearms is not a safe hobby or practice for anyone with an autism-spectrum disorder.  I understand that many people enjoy the sporting use of firearms but the recent tragedy highlights horrible, horrible risk that exists.  In good conscience, I can only recommend that you remove all firearms from your household.  The second thing to understand is that this does not need to be your hobby.  There are safer alternatives. I strongly recommend that you seek regular counseling and therapy with a professional who has experience helping people diagnosed with Asperger's.  Finding a new, safer outlet and means of exploring your interests is something that you can achieve and would be a worthy goal to be working toward in ongoing counseling.  I urge you to take this seriously, to let others know that you have firearms in the house, to have the firearms removed from your home, and to work toward a healthier and safer hobby.

105,Asperger's Syndrome and Gun Owner,"
        My suggestion is, at best, a very simple one, but probably the most effective way to lessen the potential fear others may have of you simply because you're ""different"" (I say that in a nice way, I don't want you to think I'm being rude!).
You shouldn't be worrying about whether or not to ask your doctor about it. As an owner of one or more firearms, you should follow all the basic rules of firearm safety....
1. Never keep your guns loaded when they are not being used immediately. This will severely lessen the chance of an accidental shot.
2. Keep your guns locked. By this I mean get the trigger locks AND a locked box, carry case, or gun cabinet. Make sure ALL of your guns are locked up when not in use.
3. MAKE SURE THE SAFETY IS ALWAYS ON! :) Emphasis on that one.
4. Keep your firearms manuals near your guns. This includes everything from the little weird booklets they sometimes include with purchases all the way to the hunter's regulation books, federal firearms regulation books, etc.
5. Keep your ammunition separated from your guns. As in, don't put a box of ammunition in the same case as the gun locked in there, unless transporting in order to hunt or target shoot, etc.
6. If you absolutely MUST keep a weapon out of lock and near you, for your own safety concerns, try to find non-lethal ammunition for it. Well, know that any projectile from a gun can kill, given the right range and circumstance, but not all of them are guaranteed to. Try cotton blanks, or perhaps a small game pellet rifle (around the 1,000 fps range is usually rated for hunting small game but uses only a large spring or sometimes compressed air to propel a pellet which has no shell, casing, powder, primer, etc.). Although any of these can, and have, killed people, they're far less likely to cause fatalities, yet the sheer pain and surprise from recieving a blow from them would scare most would-be attackers into fleeing.

Now I don't write any of this to say something obvious or act as if you didn't know it already, but you DID mention that you keep loaded guns in your home. I have nothing against guns, but really my opinion is that they should never be kept loaded outside of your own hands.
Sometimes, people just get scared because they don't understand what another person's condition means, or how mild or severe it is. Having Asperger's DOES NOT mean you're stupid, ignorant, violent, irrational, inconsiderate, thoughtless, careless, dangerous, or homicidal. Judging by your concerns, you seem to be fully and capably aware of what guns do, and you also have the presence of mind to understand that others may not like the fact that you have them. That alone makes me believe that you honestly have no reason to get rid of your guns. You sound like a responsible and mature person who is trying to ease other people's fears related to your condition, and by extension, the fact that you own firearms.
Sadly, there will always be somebody who does not agree with this. Not my viewpoint, not yours, and sometimes not with any ownership of firearms by anyone. And truly, there is nothing you can do to appease these people. They will always think that you are incapable, just because you have Asperger's and they consider it some form of blindly self-centered psychosis with a mix of idiocy and incompetence....which is not usually the case.
Anyway, the best I can say is just to be extra-safe with your guns, and make sure that YOU are the ONLY ONE with keys to your locks! Label the keys if necessary, color-code perhaps. If anyone tries to say something, tell them what you told us-you don't WANT to go shoot anyone, but you DO want to protect yourself should you need to.
Last but not least, if they still don't like it, smile and tell them to stick it where the sun don't shine, and walk off with a grin on your face. :)

113,Obsessed,"
        One of the defining characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorders (including Asperger's Syndrome) is highly stereotyped behaviors or interests.  Usually this manifests as an interest in particular items, activities, or phenomena. It may be possible that an overzealous interest in your daughter is a manifestation of this characteristic, but it seems somewhat unusual.  Only a professional doing a direct evaluation of the young man could provide a diagnosis.

However, regardless of whether the young man is diagnosed with a developmental or psychiatric disorder, I would urge you to continue to report your concerns to the proper authorities (both the school and the police, as you feel appropriate). The police and the school professionals (hopefully there is a school counselor, psychologist, or behavior analyst involved in helping to address his behavior) should have some suggestions on how to avoid worsening the situation.  Explicitly ask for, and follow, their advice on how to interact with (or not) the young man.

Also, I have always been curious if these episodes (but on a lesser level throughout the day) have anything to do with what might look like ADHD? Could it all be related somehow? BTW, he is not on any medication. He does take omega-3 and evening primrose (omega-6). 

What are some examples of those other explanations? My husband and I feel like we keep hitting a brick wall. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

        The first place to start is having your children assessed by a professional with experience diagnosing autism and other disabilities.  Your children's pediatrician should be able to provide you with a referal.  This is just step one of a long-term process of helping your children recieve the services they need, but there is hope and the possibility of improvement.  Once your children have been assessed to determine if diagnoses are appropriate, you'll have a better idea about needed services.  It sounds like your children are also in need of individualized education plans (IEPs).  These require their schools to provide needed services and structure their education in an effective manner.  In addition to that, there are a variety of in-home services available in many areas.  There is help available for you and your children.  Your job is to have them assessed and then follow up to determine services available where you live.

        this is a post I'd written on another forum.i thought I would copy and paste as it contains a bit more detail about their problems. 


I have 3 sons.my eldest is 9.he was born at term.normal delivery with no complications.i took him home 12 hours later.he was a perfect text book baby apart from being clumsy and having asthma(controlled with inhalers) until he started nursery at 3. 
     I started to notice he struggled to retain information eg recognising letters/numbers, he has poor pencil grip, his handwriting is awful and he struggles with fine motor skills.he can not ride a bike and struggles with ball skills.he is not very interested in physical activities and prefers to be in his own company or on a one to one basis with adults although he does mix with peers.he finds making friends difficult and can ramble on about a subject of intrest for long periods or time.he doesn't consider people's unwillingness to be in a conversation,their opinions or emotions and will often interrupt people already engaged in a conversation or activity.he is diagnosed with hyper mobility and dyslexia. 
    I raised concerns but was told it was early days and he would soon pick up.his memory is fantastic and he absorbs all information like a sponge especially with subjects that intrest him.maths, science and computers really are his strong points.his ability exceeds those of his peers but he is not meeting that ability on paper!he also gets confused with remembering more than one verbal instruction at a time.he has a very wide vocab but does use language very literally. 
     my middle son is 4 and has just started full time school.he was also born at term and developed really well with no indicators of any problems.he was a very alert baby and has never needed a lot of sleep to be full of beans.his physical development has always matched development milestones but his speech and language is delayed and he is having therapy for this without much real improvement.i started to be concerned by his speech and language and understanding around 12-18 months of age. 
     my son is always active from swinging his legs or playing with his fingers while sitting to jumping up and down to running in circles.he is impulsive, has a short attention span, poor appertite, restless sleep with regular waking, constant tossing and turning while asleep and has issues with not having my attention constantly.he can be destructive, desruptive, has a very short fuse and has a fiery temper.he can have violent tempers which I can't always explain.he will hurt himself and others and almost seems to gain release/pleasure from doing so.he also has issues with leaving me, does not like strangers to come into our home, can need a lot of physical contact (kisses and hugs) and verbal reassurance ( I'm your big boy arnt I? and love you are two things you hear from him very often) but is selective about times he will allow in one within his physical space. he likes to stick to routines at bedtime etc, likes to be told the next 2/3 things we are going to do,follow the same routes to school etc and can get adgetated / upset or angry if this doesn't happen.he likes to feel in control of his surroundings and people in them at all times.he always has bits of plastic, toys etc in his mouth and likes to carry small toys that fit in the palm of his hand especially when he's feeling anxiety.he shows very little if any awareness of danger or consequences. 
    school is a different matter though.he almost regresses into himself, doesn't mix with peers very well, prefers adult company, soils himself 2-3 times a week, is very tactile with adults ( needs to be hugged or touching a piece of their clothing) , is finding learning to read, write and recognise/ memorise letters/ numbers etc difficult.he displays no aggressive or disruptive behaviours at all!other than his speech and language delay the school do not see that he has problems. 
    my youngest son is 2 and was born at term with no complications.he has asthma but is otherwise healthy.he quite early on displayed signs of delays in physical development, understanding of language and intended use of toys etc and speech and language.he functions at approx 6-12 months behind in all areas.at 15 months his speech and social skills totally vanished!we are almost back to the point we were at then. 
     he has an abnormally high pain tolerance, aggressive outbursts towards himself others and physical objects when tired, scared, angry or frustrated.he never seems to feel full and will constantly eat if allowed to.he is very selective about what foods he will eat.he doesn't like the feel of grass,sand or anything slimy or sticky.he also puts small unedible objects in his mouth a lot. 
    he does not mix with children very well and does not like to be in unfamiliar surroundings or around unfamiliar people and will avert eye contact with people he doesn't know or is unsure of.he can get can get really upset/angry in this situation.he can play along side but not actually with other children.on times in his own world absorbed in a repetitive activity.he can also be extremely possessive of certain toys and belongings. he makes grunting noises as a means of communication and screams a lot. if you ask him a question he mostly just repeats it back to you or if it has options he just says the last one.if you ask him the same question straight after but swap the options around he will again repeat the last one which could be totally different! 
he has recognised delays and receives support through play therapies and is awaiting speech and language therapy. 

    I'm at my wits end and do not know where to turn for help!are my sons conditions connected and what could cause these problems?please help me!!??could they all have a type of autism?

        I read your cry for help and its brought tears to my eyes.  Many of the behaviors you describe from all three of your boys, I saw in my son.  I knew there was something wrong but  no one would listen including his pediatrician.  It became noticeable when he was 2yrs old.  Lack of speech, odd ways of playing with toys and on and on .  The doctor said, oh he will grow out of it, boys are slower than girls.  This went on for years .  I took its upon my self to study up and found out that  my son exibited many characteristics of someone with autisum.   From that point on I had to become my son's advocate for rights.  I wouldnt take no for and answer .  Even with all of my determination, her wasn't diagnoised until her was 10yrs old.   Insist that your pediatrician give you a referral for your boys to bed evaluated and then diagnoised.  Also request evaluations by the school psychologist for autisum.  I hope this helps a little.

122,Inappropriate peeing,"
        Your grandson isn’t the only child with an ASD that displays this pattern of urinating in inappropriate places. This is most difficult to treat if it happens at night while you’re sleeping. If it’s in the same place (e.g., in a clothing hamper), sometimes just removing the item that he urinates on can be helpful. I am assuming that these aren’t just accidents but sometimes it can also help to make sure that he is toileted on a regular schedule and watch his fluid intake before bed (if the issue happens overnight). If he understands contracts, placing a contingency where he can earn something special for each set period of time without any inappropriate urination can work. My recommendation is to speak to a board certified behavior analyst about the specifics of the problem.

        Based on your description, I'm not sure if an autism diagnosis would be appropriate, but it would be worth having him assessed.  The behavior issues you describe are all solvable, and can also occur in typically developing children.  Seek out a behavior analyst in your area (the BACB website has a useful directory).  The fact that your son is so bright is a very favorable sign for the liklihood of your coming up with an intervention that works for him.  Generally speaking, relatively simple contingencies using rules and reward can be very effective in cases like this.  For example, have him pick a favorite treat or activity that he can earn every hour for not talking about inappropriate things (e.g., death or medical issues).  The essence is to tell him exactly the behavior you expect and arrange consistent rewards for him.

126,8 Year old son with aspergers,"
        It would not be appropriate for me to offer any opinions about whether these behaviors may be related to medication for your child; I am not a physician, have never met your child, etc.  However, fatigue, lethargy, and irritability are potential side effect that some individuals have reported when taking this medication.

While I cannot offer a medical opinion, as a behavior analyst, I will let you know one option that I might suggest if I really wanted to determine if these were related to the medication or not.  First, I would identify the behaviors that concerned me, and define exactly what I meant by each of these (although it may be easy to define what a toileting accident in the middle of the night is, defining what you mean by ""extreme tiredness"" is a little trickier).  Then, I would measure how often each of these were happening, and I would do this for a short period of time.  After that, I would consider asking the physicial to remove the medication for a period of time, while continuing to measure all of the behaviors.  This will allow you to see if he really is different off the medication!  But, to be sure, you then would reinstate the medication, and  continue measuring behaviors.  If the behaviors increased when he is taking the medication, then it can again be withdrawn to see if the problem behavior decreased again.  If this type of ""reversal"" was done (more than once), and you reliably saw less problem behaviors without the medication and more problem behaviors when he was taking the medication, it would increase your confidence that these were truly side effects of the medication.

I hope some of these comments are helpful.

127,Quirky or a problem?,"
        It is just my opinion, but anytime a parent has concerns about their child, whether these are behavior issues or strictly medical issues, they should hsave these checked out.  In this case, I would begin by talking to your child;s pediatrician about your concerns.  be sure to prepare ahead of time--make a list of all the behaviors that concern you (I always suggest preparing ahead of time, because in the moment, many people forget to mention some important things).  You might consider breaking your list into 2 categories.  First, what are the behavioral deficits that you see (things that other children her age are doing that she is not).  This list could include things like her difficulty learnin the alphabet and numbers, problems with fine and gross motor skills, difficulty with social interactions with peers, etc.   The second category could be considered behavioral excesses: what behaviors is she engaging in that typical children her age do not engage in (or at the very least, other children do them much less frequently).  These behaviors include things like singing at inappropriate times, hair sucking, hand licking, and sniffing sniffing things.  Bring these concerns to your pediatrician's attention, and ask if she could be evaluated by someone who has expertise in the assessment of young children with developmental disabilities.  perhaps it is that she is ""just young"", but if not, there are some things that can be done that would be helpful, and the sooner these can be started, the better!

Best of luck with you and your family!

128,inappropriate behaviour,"
        To me, the important question is not whether or not this behavior is ""part of his autism"" or not; the more important question should be, why is he doing this and is there anything that can be done about it!

Most inappropriate behavior--just like appropriate behavior--is learned, and occurs because it has been and continues to be reinforced, at least occasionally.  Some children emit problem behavior because it serves to get them attention from others.  For example, a young child with autism may want attention, but because of delayed language skills, does not have the ability to appropriately ask for attention.  But, if he engages in the problem behavior, it always leads to attention!  So, the problem behavior becomes the most efficient way for the child to get what he wants!  Other children have learned to emit problem behavior because it gets them out of nonpreferred situations.  For example, suppose this young boy dislikes noisy, crowded environments.  he may not have the appropriate language skills to tell an adult that he needs to leave, so he remains in this situation that he finds aversive.  But, perhaps he has learned that if he pulls someone's pants down, he will be removed!  Again, because the child may have poor communication skills, the problem behavior becomes the most efficient way to get what he wants!

There are other potential reasons why this behavior may be occurring, but my point is that these behaviors are often the easiest ways ways to get what the child wants.  Once we know why the behaviors are occurring, we can focus on teaching the child new skills that will give him appropriate ways to get these things, so he doesn't need to rely on the bad behaviors to get them.

I hope this is helpful.

134,Autism?,"
        Autism is diagnosed based on delays in social interaction and language skills and highly stereotyped or repetitive behavior.  It doesn’t sound like your son really meets these criteria.  You did mention that he flaps his hands when excited, but plenty of typically-developing people engage in little repetitive behaviors, so that alone isn’t necessarily call for concern.  Low muscle tone or ambidexterity are not diagnostic criteria for autism – there may be a higher prevalence of either/both of those issues in this population (I’ve never heard of it, but it’s possible), but they certainly don’t indicate a diagnosis.
If you are concerned about his muscle tone or his fine motor skills, I’d encourage you to bring that up to his pediatrician.  He/she may refer your son to see an occupational therapist, who can provide direct therapy and strengthening skills to help with that issue. 
Best of luck to you

        None of those signs are any more than signs, it won't give an autism diagnosis. If your son doesn't have problems with social relationships and language (either in development or in use), autism isn't a right diagnosis.

        The defining characteristics of autism include deficits in communication and social interaction, and perseverative patterns of behavior.  Based on your description, and the fact that multiple professionals have assessed your son and not observed signs of autism, it would seem like an autism diagnosis isn't warranted right now.  If you continue to have concerns, you can, of course seek other opinions.  However, I suggest you take a step back from worrying about the diagnosis.  Autism diagnoses make use of behavioral criteria, there's a wide range of behavior patterns and sensitivities that can lead to diagnosis and there can also be discrepancies between professionals in terms of whether a diagnosis is seen as appropriate.  At the end of the day, whether your child receives a diagnosis or not is less important than whether he receives help and services to address challenges that he faces.  Really, every child would benefit from having an IEP and receiving additional help to bolster areas of learning in which he/she is struggling.  Could your son benefit from some additional tutoring, or any other service?  If so, the presence or absence of a diagnosis doesn't change this fact and shouldn't change your efforts to make sure your son receives help that would benefit him.

        It is possible that a diagnosis on the autism spectrum would be appropriate for your daughter.  I suggest asking the doctors you've spoken to for a referral to a professional who can assess your daughter to determine if she meets the criteria for a diagnosis.  As a general rule, I recommend assessment if there is any concern at all.  In the mean time, and regardless of the diagnosis, make sure you are actively perusing services for your daughter.  Issues such as her attending, social interaction, and toileting can all be addressed through appropriate behavior-analytic therapy.

        It would be helpful to know what country you are posting from.
In the UK there are three types of state school: mainstream, mixed (mainstream and special needs); and special needs.  Then there are independent and private schools.
You would be best advised to speak with a national organisation for Downs Syndrome and Autism in your country to find out what the educational rights of your child are.  You could also get advise from a solicitor who specialises in special needs educational law.
Having said that, you need a school that has experience and expertise in the conditions your child has.  I tried to keep my son (with autism) in a mainstream only school for over 3 years waiting for them to train up and understand his needs.  It didn't work because they just weren't interested.  It was three years of him losing skills, becoming anti-school and my general and mental health deteriorating because of the school's lack of even the most basic understanding of how to meet the needs of a child on the autistic spectrum.  And my son is high functioning autistic!
He now goes to an Enhanced School which is a mixture of mainstream children and special needs in each class.  All the staff have training and experience of autism, and it works.  And I know definately at that school there are children with autism who are still in diapers and who are in mainstream class.
If the school is being so negative about your child then that might not be the right environment for your child.  And although you may have the 'law' on your side and could fight to keep him there and for them to meet his needs, are they really experienced enough to know how to educate him?  In my experience the answer is usually no.
You would be better advised to focus on finding a school that has the best facilities and experience to meet his needs so that he makes better progress.

145,Does this kid fit Asperger's? Descriptions are too technical and Vague.,"
        
It’s true that Asperger’s syndrome can be difficult to diagnose because there is a wide range in what is considered normal behavior, but people diagnosed with Asperger’s do have more pronounced deficits in social skills.  Because 3-year-olds don’t have very sophisticated social skills, though, it can be tough to detect deficits at this age.  Honestly, if you feel like your son has good social skills (for a 3-year-old) and you aren’t concerned, rest easy - your description doesn’t suggest any glaring deficits in social skills or overly ritualistic/stereotyped behavior.    If you are having some doubts because of what his teacher said, though, there is no harm in speaking with his pediatrician.  His pediatrician will be able to better help you assess whether his behavior falls within the normal range, and if necessary, can refer you to a professional who can do a thorough evaluation to determine whether a diagnosis is warranted.

146,Does this kid fit Asperger's? Descriptions are too technical and Vague.,"
        While in retrospect, many children with Asperger's had some signs when they were pre-schoolers, it's generally too early to give them a diagnosis of Asperger's at that age....that doesn't stop some clinicians from doing so but I feel it's inappropriate because most children lag in one thing or another, and for some children they are just going to lag a little socially, but usually catch up but first grade.

In children with Asperger's, however, you usually really see them start to diverge socially from their peers by first grade, and things like hypersensitivity might become apparent or more pronounced.

If by 4.5, he still seems to have some of the non-verbal cue reading struggles you listed, I don't think it would hurt to just teach him what certain non-verbal body language means. Remember though, 3.25 is still very young, especially for boys who often take a little longer to mature.

        Problem behavior of this sort is sometimes observed in individuals with autism-spectrum disorders, but it sounds like this is new behavior from your brother.  I'm not sure how old your brother is, but it sounds like he communicates effectively.  The most successful interventions for this kind of behavior involve contingency management, and a behavior contract might be effective.  It sounds like he understands that he shouldn't be doing this, given the fact that it sounds like he attempted to hide the fact that he was the one who did it.  Getting mad at him isn't going to help, but explaining clearly that this sort of behavior is unacceptable, and arranging some contingencies for him is a good place to start.  For example, something simple like grounding him from TV, video games, computer access (or other preferred activities) might be an effective consequence.  In addition to that, you might add an additional incentive for going one week, two weeks, a month, etc... with no problem behavior like this.  Explain the rules to him, be consistent about following through with them, and interventions like this are often effective.

156,Won't stop eating,"
        I am guessing that you might have already addressed some of these first points, but just in case not:
First, I would recommend that you take her to the pediatrician and describe the problem – it is important to rule out any medical issues.  Also, you should try to establish some clear boundaries for the entire family on when and where food is allowed.  Is it possible that others are eating in front of her outside of meal and snack times?  This would probably increase her food seeking.  Also, I know that it may be hard to do, but I would also recommend limiting the amount of starchy and sweet snacks on hand – if she gets into the pantry and all she finds is canned goods, raw potatoes, and a loaf of bread, then breaking into the pantry will probably hold less appeal.  (if you must have them, keep the crackers and sweets hidden in the top of the cupboard, and don’t let people get into them in front of her). 
More importantly,  I think you are on the right track with trying to give her substitutes for food – tickling, attention, etc.  You might want to continue to expand along those lines.  Does she like and properly engage with toys?  It may be that she lacks good play skills and that food is one of the only clear (and easy to access) reinforcers for her.  I would work on trying to keep her engaged, possibly even explicitly teaching her some new independent and cooperative play skills.  Make sure that toys are constantly and freely available, and try to recruit the other kids to play with her, too.  
Hopefully teaching her some leisure skills while keeping food boundaries very clear for the entire family will help.  Good luck!

        Autism is characterized by severe impairment in social interaction skills, communication skills, and/or stereotyped (ritualistic) behaviors, interests, and activities.  Asperger’s Disorder has a similar profile (restricted interests, delayed or inhibited social interaction skills), but without the developmental and language delays seen in children with a diagnosis of autism. 

It does sound like there is some repetitive behavior; however, it’s not possible to tell from the description whether it meets a level that would qualify for a diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder.  Also, it’s not clear whether he would meet the criteria for deficits in social or communication skills.  Clearly you are worried, so I would recommend that you speak with his pediatrician to ask about whether a referral to a developmental psychologist, neurologist, or other specialist in autism is warranted - only a trained professional who has conducted an in-person assessment can provide an accurate diagnosis.   Best of luck to you.

160,Autism in toddler?,"
        It's important that you present your concerns to your child's pediatrician.  I always suggest that people write down a list of the behaviors of concern ahead of time, so that they don't forget anything important.  I'd also try to keep these straightforward and to the point.  So, your list might start with items such as this:

1.  Was saying several words at age 12 months, but at 15 months, speech disappeared.

2.  Does not make eye contact.

3.  Engages in repetitive, non-functional behaviors, such as rocking her head back and forth.

4.  Toe walking.

Once you complete the list, speak candidly to the pediatrician.  If he or she simply dismisses your concerns, I'd ask if your child can be evaluated by someone who specializes in evaluating/diagnosing young children with autism spectrum disorders.  I certainly cannot tell you whether your child may have autism simply from reading a brief paragraph. However, if your child does have a diagnosed condition such as autism, early intervention is critical, and the most effective interventions involve the use of applied behavior analysis.  You can look to see if there are any Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBA) in your area who specialize in the treatment of very young children with autism at  www.bacb.com.  Best of luck.

162,Aspergers child who started to play with feces,"
        I wouldn’t say that urination and defecation issues are necessarily typical of kids with Asperger’s, although there is a higher incidence of behavior problems in general as compared to a typically developing population.   If you haven’t already done so, your first step should be to take him in to see your pediatrician so that they can rule out any medical issues that may be contributing to the problem (constipation, urinary tract infections, etc.).   Second, look out for any information that might provide clues on why he is doing this: It wouldn’t be surprising if he was getting a fair amount of attention for this, or if urinating on his brother’s bed was retaliation for a perceived or real sleight from his brother.   
I would definitely consider trying to access behavior therapy services for him, simply because the behavior itself sounds problematic and you might see further problems develop if you don’t directly address it now.   If you are looking for a local behavior analyst, you can go the Behavior Analyst Certification Board website (http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html) and search the directory for someone near you.    Best of luck to you.

        Adults with disabilities certainly can be taught to use the toilet appropriately, and the sort of teaching you would use with a child is often still effective.  A common method of doing this involves blocking out a few hours, giving him lots to drink, and bringing him to the toilet to give him the opportunity to practice.  If the issue is ""aim"" rather than him having accidents, a way to address that is to arrange differential reinforcement for accuracy on his part.  Having a visual stimulus prompt (as you suggest) along with instruction and reinforcement (i.e., praise) when he hits the right spot all sound like good ideas in this case.

173,Brushing Technique,"
        Sensory integration therapy has been used with individuals with autism spectrum disorders since the 1970s.  In this treatment, sensory stimulation (e.g., brushing, joint compression, swinging, etc.) is provided, with the thought that this will improve cognitive functioning and decrease problem behaviors.  Personally, I find the arguments for using this therapy a bit weak.  Some have described the logic behind using this treatment as a circular (e.g., ""Why do individuals with autism have problem behavior, such as engaging in repetitive behaviors?  Because they have sensory processing issues.  How do we know they have sensory processing issues?  Because they engage in problem behavior).  


Any time I think about whether a treatment may be effective or not, the first thing I always ask is, ""Is their good scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of this technique"".  Testimonials and anecdotal reports do not constitute good scientific evidence.  Asking people to fill out a rating scale to judge the effectiveness of a treatment is not good scientific evidence.  Evaluating the effectiveness of one intervention while a second intervention is also in place is not good scientific evidence.  To me, scientific evidence involves doing a controlled experiment using generally accepted scientific methodology, and then submitting that experiment to scrutiny by expert reviewers.  If you use these criteria as scientific evidence, to the best of my knowledge, there is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of sensory integration in improving cognitive functioning or reducing problem behavior.

Many of the activities used during sensory integration therapy can be highly enjoyable.  Personally, I enjoy the sensation of rocking in a rocking chair.  At night, if I was watching television before I went to bed, I would probably really enjoy rocking in a chair while watching TV.  However, would the experience of rocking on a Sunday evening cause me to attend better during meetings at work the next week?  I doubt it. But, for the period of time I was rocking, I was really enjoying it!  Just remember that engaging in a preferred activity does not necessarily mean that it will lead to long-term improvements in behavior.  If you like the sensation that brushing provides, you can certainly do this yourself.  

I don't know all the sensory issues that you have, but many of us dislike certain sensations.  When I was young, on the 4th of July, my family always attended a big fireworks display, and the seating area was in situated where the noise of the fireworks was very loud.  I hated the loudest ""booms""; I used to sit with my fingers in my ears, to make the noise more tolerable to me. Would brushing, or swinging, have increased my tolerance to that noise that I found so difficult to tolerate?  Absolutely not.  Now, as an adult, when I take my family to a similar display, we choose to sit far enough away where we can see everything, but the noise is tolerable to me.  There are plenty of strategies that can be used when people have difficulty tolerating certain sensations.

Best of luck.

        Unfortunately, I am not able to provide any suggestions about her condition may be--no one can, based upon a short description!  However, what I think you should do first is to make a list of all of your concerns.  lack of speech and drooling are two that you mentioned, but what other concerns do you have?  Does she make eye contact, does she play appropriately?  Does she engage in any problem behaviors (tantrums, screaming, etc.)?  Does she engage in any repetetive, non-functional motor movements?  I've found that making a list like this before you speak to the doctor is helpul, so that you don't forget to mention anything!

After this, I would speak to her doctor, and go one-by-one through your concerns.  Ask the pediatrician what his thoughts are regarding a diagnosis.  If he or she is unable to provide one, I would ask if there are any specialists with expertise in the assessment/diagnosis of young children with developmental disabilities.  If your daughter does have an autism spectrum disorder,I would suggest trying to locate a professional in your area with expertise in working with young children.  The quicker your daughter begins to receive services, the better!

Best of luck!

182,Is it possible that I have aspergers?,"
        Thank you for taking the time to write.  I can't tell you whether or not you might have Aspergers from a brief description--no one can.  Could some of what you described be an indicator that you may have Aspergers?  Maybe.  Are some of the things you described seen in typical people?  Absolutely!  For example, you mentioned that you look at the page number when you need to stop reading, so you can go back at a later time.  Everyone does this; it's just that some people have developed different strategies than you.  Some people use a bookmark, other's fold a corner of the page, so they can quickly go back and pick up where they felt off.

Regardless of whether or not you may have Asperegrs, I think the important thing is to develop strategies for dealing with these sorts of situations.  When my wife and I were first dating, and for the first few years we were married, she often wanted to go to parties and other social situations that involved socializing with people we didn't know well.  I absolutely dreaded those situations, as I am not really comfortable making small talk with people I barely knew (I would be the person standing in the corner not talking to anyone, while my wife happily chatted with people she had just met).  So, we developed a strategy to deal with this--she just went to some of these events without me!  It got to the point where instead of asking me if I wanted to go to a specific social event, she would just say, ""Do you mind if I go by myself?"".  It was a strategy that worked for both of us.

Here's another example from my own life--my wife has a terrible time with the right-left distinction. If I was driving in a car and she was trying to give me directions, she might say, ""turn right"", and when I did turn right, she would tell me that I went the wrong way!  Pointing towards the direction I should turn wasn't a great strategy for dealing with the situation, as I couldn't take my eyes off the road to see which direction she is pointing in!  So, to this day, if I am driving and she tells me to, ""Turn right"", I immediately say, ""RIGHT right or LEFT right""; after she takes a few seconds to think about it, she then gives me the correct information.

The point I am trying to make is that everyone has certain situations that they have difficulty with.  Regardless of whether or not you qualify for an Aspergers diagnosis, I suggest that you should focus on developing strategies to help you better deal with these situations.  You've already done some of these.  For example, you don't like wearing dresses, so you don't--unless you REALLY have to.  This is a great strategy!  You can't play string games, so don't--there are lots of other games you can play!  Difficulty knowing when to talk in a social situation?  Develop a strategy for yourself!  Maybe you will decide that the time to talk is when there is a lull in the conversation, and no one has spoken for 3-5 seconds!  Or, find an interesting topic in the news, and when there is a lull in the conversation, you might say, ""Gee, I saw in the newspaper that.....what do you think about that?""  I can't tell you what strategies to use in all these situations, but I'm guessing that you can come up with most of these yourself.  Also, when you do successfully deal with some of the more difficult situations, reward yourself!  Go out an buy that new book, or buy that treat for yourself--you deserve it!

I hope some of this is helpful.  I wish you the best of luck!

186,2 year old son with poor eye contact,"
        Some of the things you describe could be features of a child on the autism spectrum, but they might also be representative of a child with a possible communication problem.  I encourage you to take your son to your pediatrician and discuss your concerns with him or her.  If your child’s doctor believes further assessment in necessary, then I recommend that you find an assessment team familiar with young children and autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  A speech and language pathologist should be a member of the team given your description of the communication problems.  (I am not a speech and language pathologist, but 3 or 4 word phrases for a 2-1/2-year-old doesn’t sound all that atypical to me.  The eye contact and lack of responsiveness to name should be of concern.)

        Thank you for taking the time to write. You indicated that everyone is telling you that he is too young to tell if your son has autism, but please remember, most of the people who have told you this are not qualified to diagnose autism in young children!  Obviously, I cannot tell you whether or not your child has autism (no one can based on reading a short statement), but what I can tell you is that if he does have autism, early intensive behavioral intervention is the key.  Thus, it will be important for you to speak to your pediatrician, and describe your concerns.  Sometimes, getting some video of a child engaging in concerning behaviors can be very helpful for a pediatrician.  Then, I would suggest asking the pediatrician if he or she could put you in contact with someone who has expertise in diagnosing autism in very young children.  If it your son is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, you will want him to receive some services from a board certified behavior analyst who has expertise in providing early intensive behavior intervention (or EIBI, as it is sometimes referred to). If you go to the Behavior Analyst Certification Board website (www.bacb.com), you can search their certificant registry to see if there are any board certified behavior analysts in your area.

I wish you the best of luck with your family.

        Using vitamin supplements as a treatment for autism has been around for quite a number of years.  However, to date, there is no scientific evidence that there are any beneficial effects for any of the vitamin therapies,

It's problematic when a treatment is supposed to be effective because it targets the cause (or in this case, one cause) of autism, because at this time,the exact cause of autism remains unknown.

I strongly suggest that readers look at the website of the Assoociation for Science in Autism Treatment (http://www.asatonline.org/).  Their mission ""is to share accurate, scientifically sound information about autism and treatments for autism"".  In the section of the website related to treatment, it will provide information about the amount of scientific evidence their is to support many treatments that have been proposed. Hopefully readers will find it helpful.

        The studies that you mentioned did show that certain types of treatments can lead to changes in certain metabolites, as measured in blood samples taken from the children (for example, in one of the studies you cited, following treatment, the researchers found that ""mean plasma methionine, SAM, homocysteine, cystathionine, cysteine, and tGSH concentrations and SAM:SAH and tGSH:GSSG in these 8 children were higher"".  Clearly, this constitutes scientific evidence, and this type of research is important. 

However, the individual who wrote the original post reported being concerned about some behaviors that she had seen in her child, such as delayed communication skills, the presence of repetitive,stereotyped behaviors, etc.  It is important to understand that none of the studies you cited showed any evidence that these treatments led to improvements in communication skills or in socialization skills, or in reductions in problem behavior--the behaviors that were reportedly of concern for this parent.  

Clearly, we need to continue doing research related to the causes of autism, and how to provide the best treatments, so that all children can maximize their potential and lead happy, healthy, productive lives.  We just don't have any evidence yet that these sorts of treatments are helpful in that respect.  This is just my opinion, but I cannot advocate for treatments that involve introducing something into the body--taking a pill, receiving an injection, etc.--when we have no evidence that this will lead to any meaningful improvements related to a child's learning or behavior.  

Thank you for taking the time to write, and I truly appreciate your taking the time to look at the actual research articles related to this treatment. I wish more people took the time to do this!

        To the best of my knowledge, there is currently no scientific evidence (i.e., controlled studies using generally accepted scientfic methodology) demonstrating that this treatment has any beneficial effects with individuals with autism.  If you look on the internet, I'm sure that you can find testimonials and anecdeotal reports that this treatment worked for this individual or that individual, but this does not constitute scientific evidence. Many of the ""fad"" therapies in autism that were subsequently found to be ineffective began with these sorts of anecdotal reports.  I still believe in the old adage, ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is"".

194,Asperger Help,"
        There are several reasons why a child might spend an hour in the bathroom at school.  The first possibility is that there is some sort of a medical issue, and it takes him that long to produce.  I'm guessing that this is not the problem here, but it is always important to rule out medical causes for behavioral issues.  There are several other reasons why this could be occurring.  First, it may be occurring because it allows you so to avoid doing academic work.  If you are spending an hour in the bathroom, then you are not spending an hour in the classroom.  So, the first thing that the teachers might do is to collect some information about what is going on when your son first asks to go to the bathroom, as this may give you some clues as to why he is doing this. For example, perhaps the teachers will find that he never asks to go to the bathroom duing art or music, but almost all of his requests occur when it is time to do math.  If this were the case, it may suggest that he is doing this to avoid doing math, likely because it is hard for him.  If the teachers knew this, they could alter his math assignments for a period of time, to make them a bit less aversive, and thus, make them something that your son does not want to avoid.  Or, they could let him do math for a short period of time, give him a short break, and start the math again.  This may also make the activity a bit less aversive.

Much problem behavior that occurs in schools occurs because it is an efficient way for the child to escape or at least postpone academic demands.  However, another possibility is that spending an hour in the bathroom means that he can engage in other reinforcing behaviors, such as engaging in self-stimulatory behaviors, which many children with autism spectrum disorders do.  So, suppose a student engages in a common form of stereotypic behavior seen in young children with autism, flapping his hands.  What happens if he flaps his hands in the classroom?  the teacher makes him stop.  What happens if he flaps his hands in the bathroom?  He can keep flapping as long as he remains in the bathroom, as no one is there to tell him to stop!  Reducing stereotypy is extremely difficult, but the place for the teachrs to begin is to make sure that there is more reinforcement available for staying in the classroom and working than escaping to the bathroom.  We all need reinforcement to maintain appropriate behavior--for me, it is my paycheck!  For your son, it may be access to specific toys. it will be importantto find things that will motivate your son to keep bathroom trips to a reasonable amount of time.

I think setting the clock may be a good idea, but you might combine this with some extra reinforcement for coming out when the clock sounds.  Now, if the teachers set a clock and he comes out, what happens?  Play time ends and work begins!  The teachers might consider setting a clock, and then developing a program that if we exits the bathroom within x number of minutes (perhaps 5 minutes) after the clock sounds, he gets a reinforcer, such as playing with his favorite toy for 5 minutes in the classroom before he starts working again.  Eventually, when he is successful, you can start to alter the times--he needs to come out within 4 minutes to get 4 minutes of play, he needs to come out within 3 minutes to get 3 minutes of play, etc.  The key will be to make it worth his while to come out, and then when he is doing so reliably, then make the criteria a bit more stringent.  being out of the bathroom has to be more fun than being in the bathroom!

I hope this is helpful. Best of luck.

199,What actions should i take?,"
        It’s always hard to answer these questions without knowing the child, and it’s always a good idea to seek out a board certified behavior analyst who’s worked with similar children.  I’m assuming your daughter has received an autism diagnosis, and your being able to talk with her about what she’s doing is a positive sign that you’ll be able to resolve these issues successfully.  In general, a good plan is to focus on rewarding the behavior you want and ignoring the behavior you don’t.  To be well armed in doing this, it’s important to have a good grasp on the things that are most reinforcing for your daughter.  Does she love movies, playing with certain toys, time on the computer, etc…?  Then, the trick is making some of her most favorite things contingent on things like washing her hands after using the bathroom, keeping her bathroom and bedroom clean, and playing on the playground well with friends.  A good strategy can be to pick one thing that’s easily doable for her and start her off having success.  For example, you might start with asking her to show you her hands after she uses the restroom and making a really big deal about how great it is that she washed them and is clean.  Save a special reinforcer for this.  Get lots of success for it, and see what happens with the smearing.  Does that behavior continue or go away.  If you’re having success with hand washing, switch the contingency so that it’s on having a clean bathroom and bedroom at regular checks.  Again, shoot for success, maybe start with checks every half hour or hour so she can receive reinforcement for the rooms being clean (rather than just punishment for smearing).

200,"Supplements, they do work for some","
        I think it is important to remind everyone that anytime someone is receiving multiple interventions at the same time, it is very difficult to attribute changes in behavior to one specific intervention.  Here, there are three different things that occurred at about the same time:  1) he started receiving therapy; 2) he was taking vitamins; 3) a new school year started, so he was receiving more educational services that he received over the summer.  So, if his behavior started to improve two months ago, how can we be sure that the improvements were due solely to any one of the above?  We can't, and it will be difficult to try to seperate out which factors are responsible.  It's quite possible that because of his therapy and what he is learning in school, he has learned some new skills that provide him appropriate ways to access reinforcers that previously were accessed by engaging in problem behavior, or perhaps he learned some new coping skills that allow him to deal with challenging situations without having behavior problems.  Sometimes, if we want to evaluate the effects of an intervention to try to understand if that specific intervention was what caused the behavior change and not something else, we can withdrawl that intervention for a short period of time, and see if behavior changes without that treatment component.  If behavior deteriorates, you would then reinstate that intervention, and watch behavior improve.   This type of evaluation is a very good way to really test the effectiveness of an intervention.  Unfortunately, we can't remove these educatrional components to see what would happen if he didn't have these new skills--he can't unlearn what he learned!.  However, you could evaluate the role of the vitamins in this manner.  If you really want to know whether the vitamins are responsible for his improvements or not, you could stop giving the vitamins for a short period of time. If the meltdowns quickly return, and you reinstated the vitamins and the meltdows stopped again, you would have some pretty good evidence that the vitamins were the cause of his improved behavior.  But, if the vitamins were stopped, and his behavior continued to be good, it would suggest that it was not the vitamins, but something else, that was responsible for his changed behavior.

I suspect if you withdrew the vitamins, you wouldn's see his behavior deteriorate, as there really is no solid scientific behavior that vitamins improve the symptoms of autism.  Unfortunately, when most people start using vitamins, there are other interventions occurring simultaneously, which really does make it impossible to know for sure what was responsible for the behavior change.  Perhaps an example will help to clairfy this.

Suppose I had a really bad infection, and my doctor prescribed a new, powerful antibiotic, that people had said was very effective.  But, because my infection was so bad, just to be sure, he also prescribed two older, well-known antibiotics, so I was taking three different medications at the same time.  If my infection went away, I might attribute it to the effectiveness of this new antibiotic--but the reality is, I could never know for sure!  Maybe it was one of the older antibiotics that was responsible for getting rid of the infection.  This is the same issue that comes up in situations where kids with autism are in school, are getting therapy outside of school, and are taking vitamins: three treatments going on at the same time, but behavior change is attributed to only one of the treatments.  We just can't be sure.

I appreciate you taking the time to write--best wishes for a happy holiday season!

201,Help understand ,"
        When a child emits behavior problems at school, it is crucial that the school conduct a functional behavioral assessment.  This will help the teachers identify why the behavior problems may be occurring, which is crucial in determining what needs to be done to decrease the problem behaviors.  For example, some behavior problems occur when a child is asked to do difficult academic work, and by emitting the problem behavior, the child can avoid doing the work, at least temporarily (e.g., if you act out when given difficult work and get sent to the principal's office, you get out of doing that work).  Other behavior problems may occur because it allows the child to get attention from the teacher or other students, and getting attention is very reinforcing for many children.  It's also possible that behavior problems occur when child's schedule is unpredictable, or when a routine changes unexpectedly.  The results of the functional behavior assessment may tell the teachers why your son is acting out--once they know why the behaviors are occurring, they will have a better idea how to react when behavior problems occur.  If they don;t know why your son is acting out, it becomes very difficult to know how to fix the problem.

If the school has not yet conducted a functional behavior assessment, I would strongly encourage you to ask that this be done. If there is no one in the school who has the expertise to do this, you might suggest that the school consult with a Board Certified Behavior Analyst with experience in dealing with behavior problems in school-aged children, as this individual can guide the school in how this should be done,

Good luck!

        If one looks at the history of treatment of young children with autism, one finds a long list of treatments that have been espoused to be the next cure for autism.  Many of these treatments have been embraced with no scientific evidence to back them up.  Data from carefully controlled studies demonstrating the efficacy of these interventions is often lacking-- in lieu of data, testimonials and anecdotal reports are instead used as proof that the intervention will improve functioning of the child.  My personal opinion is that you should be especially careful when evaluating how much scientific evidence there is to support any treatment for autism.

I think that additional research is needed on this treatment because, in my opinion, there is currently no adequate scientific evidence (based on controlled studies using generally accepted scientific methodology) that demonstrates this effectiveness of this treatment for children with autism.

205,how to prevent autism in unborn child,"
        There are no specific suggestions that I know of to reduce the risk of autism in a newborn. The best thing you can do for your unborn child is to follow the general guidelines that most experts suggest that women who are pregnant follow.  Your own doctor can probably provide a much more comprehensive list of do's and don'ts during pregnancy, but there are several things that come to mind pretty quickly.  Avoid smoking, alcohol, andd illegal drugs, and refrain from activities that might increase your odds of falling, such as skiing or snowboarding--and certainly refrain from engaging in any contact sports!.  In terms of food, you may want to avoid raw or unpasturized foods, and many experts suggest that women limit the amount of seafood that is eaten per week.  Hopefully you are already doing all of these things, but please talk to your doctor if you have more specific concerns or questions.

I wish you and your family the best of luck!!

I don't know what country you are living in, but, in Australia, we have funding for these children once they are diagnosed. Once a child has a diagnosis,you can be sure that the interventions are suited to that disorder.
Your boy would be beautiful and once this first step is complete you will be able to move on.
Good luck

209,ASD Daughter Pooing on the floor - Help!,"
        Sorry to hear you are having such difficulties.  I have two nearly adult children with Asperger's and I know how rigid they can be once they have decided something.  It's a really tough situation.  I can suggest a few things but see what you think:

- ask her why she does not want to poo on the toilet.  Maybe something bothers her about it, perhaps the noise (though you would think she'd avoid weeing there too).  Perhaps she takes longer to poo and therefore feels more exposed so seeks out quiet places she feels safe.  It may be that she can't tell you though and so this approach wouldn't help.

- is she happy to be out of nappies?  If so, maybe tell her she'll have to have them back unless she goes on the toilet.  I know you won't want her to go backwards but I don't see why you should put up with this and she needs to learn there are consequences to her behaviour.

- final suggestion is based on behaviour.  I had a problem with my cat who started going in places she hadn't before.  She used to go out and I didn't need a litter tray.  All of a sudden she started going in various places in the house - not nice!  I can sort of understand how demoralising your daughter's behaviour is as a result.  Vet checked cat, she's not ill or senile so he thought stress from new cats in neighbourhood might be cause.  After trying feline hormone stuff (very expensive and didn't work), plus a litter tray, I got very fed up with it.  Other suggestions were to make the places she goes very uninviting.  Maybe this would work with your daughter?  Put things she doesn't like in the areas she tends to go, whatever she really detests.  In my cat's case, this was balloons, plastic carpet runner and/or bubble wrap.  It's not very attractive and I resent having to do it but it has deterred the cat and she's using her tray instead.  Hopefully, if you make your daughter's favourite pooing places inaccessible or unpleasant to her, the toilet will become a more attractive option.  I hope so. 

- failing the above, if this continues, see a doctor.  She could have some physical problem, maybe had constipation at some point and has associated the toilet with the discomfort.  Maybe you could also spend time with her in the toilet, chatting, generally having a fun, happy time while she sits there, so that she associates the toilet with happy things.

I hope something works for you.  I know the stress involved in dealing with these rigid characters.  It's always in the background in some form or other and people with normal kids don't understand that.

210,Worried about 28 month old,"
        Could some of what you be described by symtomatic of autism?  Yes.  Could it be something other than autism?  Yes.  it will be important to talk to your pediatrician about finding someone on your area who specialzes in assessing/diagnosing children with developmental disorders to help figure this out.

Regardless of a diagnosis, the good news is that many of the deficits you mention, like lack of eye contact, can be taught!  Similarly, social skills can be taught (simply increasing exposure to social peers may not teach him to be more social, but it would provide increased opportunities for him to be taught how to be more social). Communication skills can also be taught, but he also needs an incentive to use words more productively.  Gesturing and pointing to items may currently get him everything he needs, but eventually, you may want to respond to his gestures by making him use words, and only then provide him with the desired item.

The real key is to intervene early.  The earlier someone begins to work on systematically teaching him these new skills, the faster he will learn.  So, I would work with your pediatrician to have him diagnosed, and then I would suggest working with the pediatrician to identify how he can receive some early intervention services.  If the diagnosis is autism or a related disability, the treatment that has proven to be the most effective is applied behavior analysis.

I hope some of this information is helpful.  Best of luck!

211,"please help, FAS/adhd child spiting, hitting, weting, being nasty to others....","
        When trying to determine how to develop a treatment for problem behavior, the most important thing that we need to consider is why the behavior is occurring. Most problem behaviors in children are learned behaviors, and they occur because the behaviors have a history of being reinforced; in other woprds, the behaviors, at least occasionally, result in the child getting the something he or she wants.  Speaking very generally, There are a couple of general categories of. items that can maintain problem behavior:

1)  Problem behavior can be maintained because, at least occasionally, it produces attention from others (e.g., the problem behavior is inadvertently followed be a lot of parental attention);
2)  Problem behavior can be maintained because, at least occasionally, it produces a tangible item that  from others (e.g., the parent gives the tantrumming child a toy to make them stop tantrumming);
3) Problem behavior can be maintained because, at least occasionally, it gets the child out of doing something they don't want to do--or at least the child can temporarily avoid doing the thing they don't want to do
4)  Problem behavior can be maintained because, at least occasionally, engaging in the behavior produces a pleasurable sensation (we typically think of these as 'self-stimulatory"" behaviors;
5)  In more rare cases,  problem behavior can occasionally be maintained because engaging in the behavior leads to a reduction of an aversive event, such as pain (e.g., a child who has an inner ear infection that has not yet been discovered may start poking his fingers in the infected ear, because doing that may temporarily relieve the inner ear pain, at least for a few seconds).

So, why is it important to identify which of the above is maintaining the problem behavior?  Because if you don't know, all you can do is guess at what may be an effective treatment, which could be ineffective, or in some cases, your treatment may make the behavior worse! 

You mentioned that time out did not work in reducing problem behaviors. Why might time-out not work for some children?  Well,  consider the reasons why problem behaviors occur.  One reason that some children emit problem behaviors is because it gets them out of, or at least lets them temporarily avoid, something that they do not like.  So, suppose a school-age child did not like doing his homework, and he tries to get out of doing it.  Eventually, he begins to tantrum, and the parent sends the child to time out.  What happens when the child is in time out?  He may go to a quiet area and have to stay there until he is calm; but, while he is in time-out, he is avoiding the work, which is exactly what he was trying to do by tantrumming!  So, in this example, when homework was presented, and the child tantrummed, the tantrum was actually rewarded, because it got him exactly what he wanted--it got him out of doing the homework (at least temporarily).  So, in my example, not only would I expect time-out not to work, I would expect that, over time, the behavior would get worse, because the parent is inadvertently reinforcing the child's problem behavior!

So, the first step in developing an effective treatment is identifying what is maintaining the problem behavior.  This will require a functional assessment or functional analysis.  The most qualified persons to do this are board certified behavior analysts (BCBA) who specialize in the assessment and treatment of problem behavior.  If you go to the behavior analyst certification board website (www.bacb.com), you can look for BCBAs in your area,  I would also begin discussions with the child's school about the necessity of having a qualified person conduct a functional assessment/analysis as a first step in the process of treatment development.

Best of luck!

212,Autism and Immunizations,"
        I think it's really important for everyone to understand the history of the supposed vaccine-autism link.  In 1998, a British doctor and researcher, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published a study suggesting a link between vaccines and autism.  This information spread like wildfire across the internet, and in a very short period of time, many parents were convinced that the vaccines caused their child's autism.  Perhaps some of parents, who felt guilty and thought they did something to cause their childs autism, were relieved to a certain extent--it wasn't their fault after all, it was the vaccines!  All over the world, people were jumping on the autism-vaccine bandwagon, and Wakefield's study was the cause of it.

There was one enormous problem that was not uncovered until several years later--Wakefield's research was fradulent!   In 2000, the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that the scientific evidence did not support a link between receiving the MMR vaccine and developing autism. Studies conducted in other countries also found no evidence of a link. Other well-respected institutions, including the World Health Organization, also concluded that there was no evidence of a vaccine-autism link. As the evidence mounted, and Wakefield's research was scrutinized, it became clear that there were significant problems with Wakefield's research. Ultimately, Britain's General Medical Council concluded that Wakefield had engaged in professional misconduct; they described his behavior as dishonest, irresponsible, and unethical.  Wakefield was stripped of his license to practice medicine in Britain. 

So, there is actually no evidence that autism is caused by vaccines.  So why do people still think so?  Autism is generally diagnosed around 2 years of age, when the signs become a bit more obvious (e.g., deficits in communication skills, social skills, etc.).  That happens to be about the same time that some immunizations are given.  So, there is a temoporal link--a child gets a vaccine, and a few months later, he is diagnosed with autism.  The conclusion of many?  The vaccine caused autism.  However, just because two events occur closely together in time doesn't mean one caused the other!

I hope this information is helpful.  Best of luck!

        Thank You Dr. Graff, First let me say that I applaude you for studing your area of expertise in Behavior Analysis.  Working with children with autism and looking for answers, you are often looked over as heros except by those parents who seek your help.  I have read pro's and con's to this subject on behalf of those who believe vaccinations are the cause of Autism and those who do not believe it.  As you stated, I see the coincidence of children getting vaccinated and the time parents are informed that the child has autisim.  I also see that there is no proof that the vaccinations are not the cause of Autism and I wonder if proof should be on the non-professional parents or on the doctors, scientists and pharmaceutical.  

As a lay person, I would love to see conclusive proof from an non-bais organization that does not have any financial benefit from its conclusions.  I try to be opened minded however I guess I am kind of skeptical of government and big organization.  

I am surprised and shocked to see that 1-10,000 children had been diagnosed 10 years ago and now those numbers have increased to 1-250 according to the Congressional Hearings.  There is no explanation for those results or what may be causing the rise in Autism.  You and other professionals in this field are still searching for the cause but it is on the rise and we still have more questions and few answers.  I believe that this is one more reason that people are skeptical.  So now we as parents are asking questions.  What is going in the vaccinations?  Is Mercury in some of these vaccinations?  Is traces of DDT in vaccinations?  Why do parents have options on some medications but they are combining optional vaccinations in non-optional medications which takes away a parents option?  

If you have a link(s) Not from companies who are selling the medication or benefit from the sell...that I can find that actually tells the laymen what goes in the vaccination and any information concerning the study of the medication and results from the studys so that as an informed parent, we can decided what is best for our child rather...I would appreciate your assistance.  

Once again, thank you for replying and God Bless

        Every kid needs to take their vaccines. I have two and they have all their shots up to date as required by California...  I did delay the vaccines. I did not allow the doctor to give them any shots when they were babies. I also never allowed the doctor to give them any shots with mercury (such as flu shots) and never allowed the doctor to give more than one vaccine at a time. We started vaccines only around 18months to 2 years of age.  Gave them slowly with months in between and one at a time to make sure that the children were fully vaccinated to enter elementary school. my older one did receive the usual vaccines right at the time she was born at the hospital because I did not know any better and I regreted it. Once I educated myself, I was not confortable with the vaccine process in this country and I slowed down the process for my kids.  So, I agree that all kids need to have their ""necessary shots"" but I think that we are giving them their shots too soon when they are too young and their nervous system is too imature to handle.  We also should not mix the shots. Why give them flu shots that they do not need.  So, they get the flu.  They will most likely will recover.   Minimize risk is what I tried to do.

Perhaps when you talk to your daughter, you can provide a different type of example that would illustrate why it is important to get assessed, and if warranted, begin treatment ASAP.  Suppose her son had a form of cancer, that was treatable if caught early.  Wouldn't she want to doctor to check him for that, so that treatment could be started ASAP, especially since the early treatment is started, the better the outcome.  Autism is no different--the earlier you can begin treatment, the better the outcome!

        Thanks you for taking the time to post your commets on the forum.  Clearly, this is a very challenging situation, and there are obviously no easy solutions.  Because he has been given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and the fact that you used terms like ""delusional"" and ""psychotic""', part of his treatment plan needs to include medication.  Of course, this will only be helpful if he takes the medication.

Has you son ever received consultation or services from a board certified behavior analyst with expertise in Aspergers syendome and severe problem behavior (you can search for one in your area at www.bacb.com).  Behavior analysts typically take a different approach towards treating problem behavior than most psychologists.  Behavior analysts operate under the premise that behavior occurs because it has a history of being reinforced, and continues because it is still being reinforced, at least intermittently.  One of the important things that they do is to develop treatments that are based upon the function of the problem behavior.  This process often involves doing assessments to identify exactly why the problem behavior is occurring (e.g., he finds his roommate aversive, so whenever he hits his roomate, the roommate leaves, and the aversive situation is avoided, which is highly reinforcing), and to develop more appropriate ways to access the same reinforcers as he is accessing by engaging in problem behavior.  The other thing that behavior analysts typically do well is to identify reinforcers that will motivate the individual to engage in appropriate behaviors, and then to develop behavior plans that will allow the individual to access those reinforcers when they engage in appropriate behaviors.  Applied behavior analysis is the treatment for individuals with autism spectrum disorders that has the most empirical evidence to support it's effectiveness.  So, you might try to find an expert in your area, and contact him or her, to discuss your son's issues.

        Thanks for taking the time to post your question on the forum.  Obviously, I can't provide a diagnoses (or confirm that there should be no diagnosis) based upon reading a few sentences about a child.  But, to answer your question the best I can, no, inconsistent eye contact does not always mean a child has autism.  Typically, children with autism show three core characteristics:

1. A qualitative impairment in social interactions
2. A qualitative impairment in communication
3. A restricted or stereotyped pattern of activities, interests and behaviors

If you feel that your child shows all of these characteristics, then you should definitely raise these concerns with your pediatrician.  If not, you may just want to keep an eye out for these (having just turned 2, it is difficult to evaluate some of these, and sometimes these issues become more apparant as children get a bit older).

avoidance; to remove the clothing that frays such as cotton to denim or wool to nylon. 
replacement; to replace the chewing of one thing to another more acceptable source
ignoring; to just ignore and let them stop on their own accordance due to peer pressure and such.
and finally in stages; first stop the chewing by asking for it when you see them chewing but let them pull the string then once that is under control stop them at the pulling stage mentioning how by pulling the string they cost money which you could spend on fun things if they did not ruin their cloths.

i hope this was helpfull  .

232,Could my child have Autism,"
        Although one of the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorders is highly stereotyped or repetitive behaviors (like body rocking, hand flapping, etc.), two other criteria must also be present: delays in language and impairments in social interactions.  Many typically-developing children engage in stereotyped behaviors at some point, so keep in mind that (rocking) alone isn’t necessary an indicator of autism.  Your description doesn’t really address his development with respect to language acquisition or social skills, which makes it tough to say whether your concern is warranted.  In any event, in-person evaluation by a professional is necessary for diagnosis, so I would recommend that you describe your concerns to your pediatrician and ask for his/her opinion on whether your child would benefit from referral to a specialist.  
Good luck

233,Strange Assumption for a Physician,"
        It's hard to know what this individual meant by his statement, but I would not spend any time worrying about it or wondering about it.  Perhaps this statement was related to his lack of current knowledge of autism (most urologists have little knowledge of the assessment of young children with autism), or perhaps it was a poor attempt at giving a complement to the child and the people who have worked so hard teaching him over the past 2 years (e.g., He has made SO much progress over the past two years that NOW,his behaviors do not look very different than the behaviors that typical children of that age emit).  I assume the physician did not spend an extended period of time with the child, so whatever he saw on his brief observation may not have been representative of the child's overall behavior.  Personally, I would suggest that the parents not dwell on this comment.

Best of luck.

234,Could this be Aspergers or ODD? I am in tears and at the end of my tether!!,"
        ReesMom02 makes a great suggestion.  If you have concerns, absolutely have your son assessed.  Your pediatrician can point to a professional trained to do those assessments.  Even if he doesn't recieve an autism-spectrum disorder diagnosis, the behavior problems you describe can be treated.  Seek out a therapist or behavior analyst with experience working with children like your son.  Help is out there and it can make a world of difference.  In general, it sounds like you're going in the right direction trying out different contingencies.  The trick is finding the consequences he really cares about.  Special reinforcers for periods of time where he's good, and time out from reinforcers for inappropriate behavior.

        Have you considered having him diagnosed? Our aspie child needed therapy to help work on the issues you mention. They do blame other people for things, they make odd noises, fidget, don't make friends, and will be picked on in school if the proper things aren't in place to help them. 
In fact we took my son out of public school and home schooled him for two years while we worked on social skills therapy, and getting a proper diagnosis. Now he will be going back to school but with the proper therapy and supports in place.
Asperger child do not mean to sound rude, they just speak matter of fact all the time. They are not capable of putting themselves in your shoes to realize how a comment might affect someone else. If something is, then it just is to them.

I would consider seeing a psychologist or developmental pediatrician who might be able to help you determine if he has Asperger's.  Once we did that....things improved because we were able to obtain the resources to teach my son how to have a conversation without interrupting. And that he can't always blurt out what he's thinking. Etc...certainly not easy of course, but at least you'd have some insight into why he's this way.

        The thing to do would be to have frank discussions with your pediatrician.  If your son has a condition that milk would exacerbate, you and your husband both need to be properly informed about it.  Dietary treatments for autism, however, are ineffective.  Multiple research studies have shown this conclusively, and I have never met a professional providing treatment or educational services to individuals with autism who has found those sorts of interventions to be effective.  If there is a medical reason to avoid dairy, absolutely make sure that you’re following your pediatrician’s guidelines.  However, I wouldn’t keep my fingers crossed about seeing an improvement in symptoms of autism.

238,How do i convice my husband to stop giving our autistic son milk?,"
        Perhaps give dad some information about autism and opioid/milk reactions. Most of the ASD Kids on our forum react this way to milk or wheat. They do a lot better off of it and there are alternate nutritional approaches for our kids that are healthy and dairy free.
You can provide proper nutrition without cow milk which I think a lot of people don't realize. In fact there is more calcium in broccoli than in commercially pasteurized milk. 

We took ours off of it at age 3 because all he did was drink milk. He would not eat. And he was withdrawn, pale and layed around all day and suffered chronic constipation. It made a big difference. With the opioid reaction, it makes them addicted to the milk. But it also affects behavior, development and speech. 

I would consider gf/cf for him based on what you said he eats. Another option is to have him tested for gluten/casein allergy. perhaps if dad see's in on paper he may realize that your son really has a medical condition, and you not just a worried mom. It's not a bad to have the pediatrician or autism doctor explain this to your husband. ASD kids are different. No doubt about that, and they have many food intolerance's.

Your frustration is pretty common among mom's with ASD kids. It took me a long time to get it through family members heads, NOT to feed my son food coloring or milk.

239,infections ,"
        I'll leave it up to the medical doctors to determine the cause of these issues, since some infections may be bacterial, and others viral.  However, I suppose it is possible that some of the behaviors that she may engage in could theoretically increase the odds of geting an infection in and around her mouth. For example, some young children with developmental disabilities engage in object mouthing--they frequently put objects in their mouth and manipulate them or chew on them (e.g., soft toys, harder plastic items, etc.).  Some other children engage in behaviors such as skin picking.  If f a child picks at their lips, for example, and gets a slight cut, and then mouths objects in the environment that may not be clean, I suppose it is possible that this may lead to an increased chance of getting an infection.  As another example, the child who does not keep their hands clean and frequently engages in hand mouthing may also be an increased risk for getting infections, especially if they engage in other behaviors such as biting thei lips, or the insider of their cheeks. However, as I said earlier, I will leave it up to the medical professionals to determine the cause of her infections.

242,Autism and incontinence in teenagers,"
        My first recommendation would be to continue to pursue possible medical conditions – it is concerning that the bowel incontinence and reduce food intake occurred at the same time. Changes in school setting could definitely have a drastic effect on kids with developmental delays, but I would look to rule out any medical issues first.  While you are doing so, you might also take the time to find out what his routine is like at school (either by interviewing the teachers and paraprofessionals, or by actually going in to observe, if they will allow it).  With respect to meals: was there a large change in his meals across the two schools?  Are the foods different?  Was he eating in a quiet classroom before, but now is in a noisy cafeteria?  Does he have sufficient time to eat?  Are the foods served substantially different?  Were people there reminding him/helping him to eat his lunch before, whereas they expect him to be more independent now?  I would ask similar questions with respect to toileting routines: Does he have adequate access to the bathroom?  Is he prompted to go into the bathroom and sit occasionally, even if he doesn’t ask to use the bathroom?  Are there incentives for using the bathroom properly (e.g., some kind of token program)?  Asking the school to consider some of these strategies – frequent prompts, allowing adequate access to foods/bathroom facilities – might make a difference.  
I’d also look at the consequences for food refusal and toileting accidents.  Does he get a lot of attention (e.g., are teachers preoccupied during the start of the meal, but become concerned and hover over him when he doesn’t eat?  Or does he have to stay at his desk until he’s eaten a certain amount, thereby missing the next scheduled – and possibly disliked – activity?
Figuring this out can be difficult, and depending on the extent of the problem, you might find it helpful to get the advice of a certified behavior analyst.  If the school doesn’t have one on their faculty, you might look at the BACB website (http://www.bacb.com/index.php?page=100155) to find a local provider.

Best of luck to you

243,Is my 5 year old autistic?,"
        Autism and Asperger’s Disorders are characterized by a similar set of characteristics, most notably deficits in social interaction skills, communication skills, and highly stereotyped behaviors (e.g., repetitive motor or vocal behaviors that don’t seem to serve any function) or interests (topics of conversation or activity are highly restricted or narrow).  The major difference among the disorders is in language development: in Asperger’s Disorder, there is no delay in early language development. In Autism, there is some delay in language acquisition.  Also, delays (in language or social development) must be noted to occur prior to age 3 for a diagnosis of Autism.
Formal diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders requires in-person evaluation by a professional; given your concerns, I’d recommend that you seek the advice of your pediatrician.  Your description sounds as though she does have some language delays, although delayed language acquisition is more common in multi-lingual families (so it’s difficult to tell whether the language delay is really diagnostically relevant).  It also sounds as though she might have some other indicators of autism, although your description doesn’t sound like they are occurring at very interfering levels (somewhat delayed social interaction skills, and possibly some repetitive or restricted interests).  In-person evaluation is critical, though, because one cannot tell from a description whether she truly meets diagnostic criteria for any of the spectrum disorders.  A typically-developing child may also display these characteristics to some extent – preoccupation with a particular game or song is pretty common in young children, as are tantrums, an inability to articulate feelings, and restricted attention spans.  
You are right to consider these things before she starts school, if only to ease your mind.  I recommend that you speak to your pediatrician, describe your concerns, and ask for his/her advice.  They may recommend evaluation by a professional more familiar with the disorders (or other relevant disorders), who can provide help with diagnosis and any recommended intervention.
Best of luck to you all.

244,Is my 5 year old autistic?,"
        I (the father of the child in this matter) would like to add a couple of things, which might clarify our daughter's bahaviour.

The things that concern us the most is that she is not capable of following instructions when she (for whatever motive) does not feel like following them:
- She throws herself on the street while crossing just because she didn't get the toy she wanted. One can forget any kind of reasoning in those situations.
- When she likes something (like my wife said earlier) she has to repeat that all day long for days on end (sometimes weeks even). It does not seem like a 'compulsive' thing though, it is more obsessive than anything else.
- She barely sits still. As in that she will sit at the table to eat, takes two bites and just walks away. If it doesn't interest her somehow, she just walks away and starts doing her own thing.
- It is very hard for her to follow any kind of routine other than what she adapted herself.

Putting this all together, we are concerned about the fact that in about a year she will have to go to school. The way we know her, we don't see her capable of following the regime of a school, where she actually has to follow instructions of an authority.
She likes to do thing that challenge her intellectually, but it has to be her pick, in the way she wants to. If not, she either just walks away, or if we insist she throws a tantrum.

Now, what we are tying to figure out is whether we might have to have her checked for a potential disorder (whichever that might be) or whether she is just a bit of a spoiled brat. ;-)
Not that the disorder scenario would be a big deal, but it would allow us to better understand 'her world' and guide her appropriately.

Our concern is really only as far as it concerns her best interest. So we want to make sure that she gets the right kind of attention and treatment that helps her develop in the best way that we can offer her.

        Based on your description, I would say that it doesn’t sound like he meets the diagnostic criteria for autism (delayed social interaction skills, delayed language skills, and highly restricted interests and/or repetitive behavior).  Further, diagnosis requires in-person evaluation by a professional, and it sounds as though your family doctor has done an informal evaluation and isn’t concerned.   Many typically developing children are picky eaters, and many refuse novel or bad-tasting items (such as medicines), so I wouldn’t be overly concerned about that as an indicator of autism.

        From your description, I’m not sure if your daughter meets the criteria for an autism diagnosis, I’m also not sure what your current discipline consists of. However, if the behavior’s continuing, it’s probably not working too well.  This sort of behavior is very treatable.  The fact that these are “on purpose” rather than accidents is actually a very good sign.  It means she’s aware of what she’s doing and is able to control it.  The next step is a matter of getting her to choose to only urinate in a toilet and not on the floor.  Consistency is key, and I think you know that already based on what you’ve written.  The thing to do now is to be consistent with a new set of contingencies.  The best way of approaching it is to make it really, really worth her while to use the toilet rather than pee on the floor.  Something special that she can earn each time she urinates on the toilet, that she only gets for urinating on the toilet, in combination with something big she can earn for going all day only urinating on the toilet can be a great way to go.  If you feel like she’s doing it for attention, minimize the attention that gets for her and maximize attention for urinating on the toilet.  Make it no big deal if she urinates on the floor, ignore it as much as possible, but make it a REALLY big deal when she urinates on the toilet.  You can set up practice trials for her where she goes and sits (even if she doesn’t have to urinate), and you then provide reinforcement.  Lots of exposure to success can be really helpful.  You could also set her up with a token or sticker program where she’s earning a weekend outing or some bigger reinforcer for longer and longer periods of time with only appropriate toileting.  Find ways to reinforce the appropriate behavior like crazy.  If you’re still having trouble, I suggest looking up a Board Certified Behavior Analyst in your area who can help.

        It is important to remember that while the way kids are raised is an important factor in why they behave the way they do, it is certainly nor the only factor!  have you descussed these concerns with your child's pediatrician?  This is always the best place to start in determining if there are specific issues that impact on your daughter's development.  It's a good idea to prepare ahead of time, and develop a list of all of your concerns, and examples of her behavior.  When many people discuss similar issues with their pediatrician, they remember a few items that are worrysome, but once they get back home, they remember a lot of other things they wished they had brought up!  So, prepare your list--if a professional heard about one or two areas of concern, they mayget a good overall picture of the child; but, if you list out all areas of concern, it may paint a very different picture of your child!  be sure to ask if there are any early intervention services that your child may qualify for, that may address some of these issues.  For example, a physical therapist may be able to look at some of the issues related to not being able to hop, walking funny, etc., while a speech/language pathologist may have ideas that might facilitate language development.  A Board Certified Behavior Analyst may be able to look at some of the behavioral issues that your child displays and come up with ideas that may be helpful.  But, the first step is reviewing all of these issues with your child's pediatrician!

249,Eight year old son's behavior,"
        The diagnoses you mention are all given based on observation of behavior. So, there are assessments, but they involve observation of the individual rather than any sort of test for an underlying physiological cause, or anything of that sort. ADHD is, in fact, diagnosed the same way. While medication can be effective in decreasing hyperactivity, it can be hard to predict which, specific, behaviors will be affected.  This is part of why the recommendation, typically, is to include behavioral interventions rather than to use medication alone. The list of behaviors you describe can all be treated behaviorally, and I recommend you seek a behavior therapist or Board Certified Behavior Analyst to help with those specifically.  Some of the behaviors and types of perseveration are common in individuals with autism diagnoses, and I would consider having him specifically assessed for an autism-spectrum disorder (ASD). OCD is another diagnosis made based on observations of behavior. This may, or may not be appropriate for your son, but, again, having him assessed would be a good idea. As far as sensory processing disorders, I am familiar with these, have researched them extensively, and have worked with a number of children whose parents had concerns about them. In actuality, there is no conclusive evidence that these exist, or that treatments based on the assumption that they do are effective. I’ve also been able to effectively treat all of those children without any sort of intervention in place for possible sensory processing issues, so I can’t ethically recommend that you invest much time pursuing that angle.

It will be important to make a list of all of the concerning behaviors your child has, and have examples of times he does this, so that the pediatrician gets a good feel for the extent of the issues.  For example, saying that ""he never sits still"" may be overlooked, while saying, ""During a typical afternoon, from 2-5 PM, he sits still for approximately 5 minutes; the rest of the time he is running in circles, and jumping on furniture, etc."", may be taken a bit more seriously.

I would also ask your pediatircian if there is anyone in your area who specializes in the assessment of young children with autism.  It certainly would not hurt to get the opinion of someone with expertise in this area, as early intervention is crucial for successful intervention.

The behaviors you describe are very familiar and concerning. We experienced those same behaviors and more at that age. I would definitely seek the help of a professional, but please beware of pediatricians! Unfortunately, a lot of pediatricians are not trained to identify autism, especially where they use a basic developmental screening test that does not necessarily raise flags for autism. I was told by three different pediatricians that my child's developmental delays and weird behaviors were 'normal' and not of concern. I believe they may have been eluded by my son's great eye contact and outgoing nature. I'm sure you understand that the earlier you catch it the better your chances for successful intervention. Since your son is under 3 you will qualify for services provided by the state. Please, seek the help of a professional who has extensive experience with autism specifically!! And hang in there, things are going to be challenging and exhausting (I'm sure they already are), but you are asking the right questions now and that's going to help you so much.

252,can a child with autism get worse ,"
        In a sense, the answer is yes. While the child’s “autism” doesn’t change, a child’s communication can take steps backward, and problem behavior can emerge, or worsen. It’s important to closely monitor the child to keep an eye on things and to make sure that you seek services when problems develop. It’s much better to treat a problem early before it intensifies or the child experiences a long history of problem behavior being an effective way of getting the things he wants.

253,possible to develope autism in children?,"
        Being raised in ""unusual"" circumstances can certainly have an impact on a child's behavior.  However, it is important to note that the indivduals and events in any child's environment have the potential to influence behaviors, both appropriate and inappropriate.  For example, parents will provide reinforcement following some behaviors (again, both appropriate and inappropriate behaviors), and this will increase the chances of those behaviors occurring again in the future; in other words, reinforcement strengthens behavior!  So, when a child asks a parent for something, and for the first time includes the word, ""please"", the parents may praise the child for saying please.  If the praise is a reinforcer for that child, the chances of the child saying ""please"" in the future increases.  Reinforcement can also strengthen inappropriate behaviors as well. Suppose a child is not receiving attention, and they emit some type of inappropriate behavior, and then the parent attends to the child.  If the attention is a reinforcer, it may increase the odds of the inappropriate behavior occuring in the future!  

So, can raising a child in unusual circumstances influence behavior?  Of course, but so can raising a child in any environment!  Could raising the child in the enviorment you describe above have ""caused"" his autism?   We don't know what causes autism, but if I had to hazard a guess, I would say probably not, especially since you suggest that his development seemed typical up to a certain point.  Some parents indicate that they knew from a very early age that there was something ""different"" about their child; others, however, report that their children seemed perfectly normal up to a certain point, and then ""regressed"".  

Regardless of whether or not he is diagnosed with autism, the most important considerations should be how to move forward, and teach him the skills he needs to know to become as independent as possible as an adult.

My 6 years old nephew was diagnosed with autism.
His mother gives him numerious supplements ( 17 all together ) a day and firmly believes that by doing it she could cure him.
This child attends a special kindegarten for autistic children for the last two years and once a week he attends a developemental centre for children with Dawn syndrome.
This child could speak some words and understand meaning of commands but has no speech as such.
He could tell what is on the picture ( eg. house, car ) when we show it to him, could say: red ball, go, up, could count from 1 to 10.
He eats the same food every day since he was 2 years old and refuses to try something new.  My sister sit him in a high chair to eat and do not let him go untill he finishes foot.  It takes up to 1-2hours.
When in kindergarten he sits with other kids around normal table.
This boy is hyperactive at times and seems not interested in adults or chldren.  Yet, he plays with me, asking me to hug me and to kiss me and is doing a lot of physical movements ( like crawling towards my legs when I am sitting ), jumping from my lap ( etc ).
Questions: do you belive that numerious supplements could cure such child?
Do you agree with his mother to fit him in high chair for 1-2 hours daily when he is at home?
Do you think it is wise to take him to the developement centre with children suffering with Dawn syndrome?
My sister said he has high IQ ( she didn't tell the score ).
Do you belive that a child, who is almost not verbal could have high IQ?
Sorry for the long list of questions.

This boy is hyperactive at times and seems not interested in adults or chldren.  Yet, he plays with me, asking me to hug me and to kiss me and is doing a lot of physical movements ( like crawling towards my legs when I am sitting ), jumping from my lap ( etc ).
Questions: do you belive that numerious supplements could cure such child?
Do you agree with his mother to fit him in high chair for 1-2 hours daily when he is at home?
Do you think it is wise to take him to the developement centre with children suffering with Dawn syndrome?
My sister said he has high IQ ( she didn't tell the score ).
Do you belive that a child, who is almost not verbal could have high IQ?
Sorry for the long list of questions.
I would really appreciate your answers.

256,Is my 5 yr old Autistic/Aspergers/HFA?,"
        From your description, it’s hard to tell if an autism-spectrum disorder diagnosis would be appropriate. Many of the characteristics you describe are seen in typically developing children as well. However, if you have concerns, or you believe your son could benefit from more intensive teaching, I recommend having him assessed. Your pediatrician should be able to refer you for an assessment, once you express your concerns.

257,Looking For answers I am desperate!,"
        Unfortunately, the challenges your daughter is facing go beyond those typically experienced by children with autism. It sounds like you’re doing the right things. It would be worth it to discuss diagnoses with your pediatrician and to seek out specialists who’ve worked with other children like your daughter. She may meet the criteria for an autism diagnosis, but there’s certainly more going on. The most important thing is to continue to push hard to get her all the services she needs. Early intensive behavioral intervention can do her a world of good in terms of helping her with communication and early skills and the more hours of services she can get in a week, the better she’ll do. Having a child struggling with the things your daughter is can be such an enormous challenge but keep getting her those services and she’ll amaze you with what she can accomplish.

258,Aspergers and Diurnal Enuresis,"
        This strikes me as a behavioral problem also, and I’m not surprised that you haven’t found medication alone to be successful. It sounds generally like her hygiene skills aren’t where you’d like them to be. There are some basic skills and tolerances that need to be developed if she’s going to be successful. She needs to be able to tolerate changing soiled clothes and bathing, there’s no reason she should be smelling badly when she’s at home. It also seems like she needs work with the entire skill set of feeling when she needs to urinate, toileting appropriately, noticing when she is soiled, and changing clothes and washing up when that happens. Given where she is now, and the fact that she can have these melt downs, getting her there can seem like a huge challenge, but it’s entirely possible. In my experience, programs to teach appropriate toileting skills have a very high success rate. My first piece of advice is to seek out a board certified behavior analyst in your area who has experience with children like your daughter and teaching toileting skills. 

Typical interventions involve starting with a very frequent schedule of prompting the child to sit on the toilet and produce and using potent reinforcers to motivate her. The first thing to do is to identify the reinforcers.  Pick out some of her favorite things and activities, sit down with your daughter, and work out a schedule for her to earn them for being dry and clean. Start small and work toward bigger things. Maybe some favorite books at the end of the night or some time playing on the computer if she stays dry all evening. Maybe set a watch for her to come check with you at 15-minute intervals. If she would be into it, she could collect her own data, giving herself checkmarks or whatever for each dry time and track her improvement over time. Don’t make a big deal about mistakes, those happen, but make a big deal about successes. If she urinates relatively infrequently, maybe give her some things to drink so that she has more practice feeling what it’s like to need to use the toilet and then toileting. She needs to learn how to monitor herself, and programs like this can be very successful in teaching that.

259,inappropriate sexual behavior in kids with autism,"
        Most behaviors that you describe occur because they are automatically reinforced (some people refer to these behaviors as ""self-stimulatory"").  In other words, engaging in the behavior produces a desirable consequence.  Everyone engages in automatically reinforced behaviors of some sort or another; most typical people can discriminate when it is acceptable to engage in these behaviors, while many children with autism cannot.   For example, if I am home alone, I may whistle and crack my knuckles, but I would not do those things in a meeting with my boss!  So, one thing to start teaching is the difference between private and public environments.  

For many children, automatically-reinforced behaviors such as this can occur when environmental stimulation is low.  So, it is important to teach the child how to independently engage in activities that provide stimulation--especially those that may provide more stimulation than the problem behavior.  I may sit at home and whistle and crack my knuckles when I am at home and have nothing to do, but if you gave me an IPAD, believe me, I would engage with that instead of ctracking my knuckles and whisteling!  So, find leisure activities that he enjoys, teach him hoe to engage with them, and this may also be helpful in reducing some of these behaviors.

Best wishes to you and your family.

260,inappropriate sexual behavior in kids with autism,"
        In my oppinion, sexual (self)stimulation in this case is need for two things:
1. reducing stressssss
2. feeling own the borders of own body

Try to imagine, that social rules are not self explaining for autistics. From autistic view, they are mostly absurd, ineffective and have to be learned with high cognitive efforts - and tolerating the irritation or cognitive dissonance to adapt those (absurd) behaviours.
So separating between inner motivation and outer requirements...

The humanoid system of sexual arousal is implemented basically before puberty, from (not later than) birth. There is no ejaculation before puberty, but the relaxing phasis at the end of orgasm can felt.
To avoid stimulation (looking) in public, it's necessary to avoid stressors (unknown situations/people/locations, crowds, people watching the kid directly) and focussing on well known objects (maybe a thing, which the kid is carrying whole time or things with simple geometrics and colour e.g. cube from plastics). In summary, try to substitute self stimulation.

Referring to Temple Grandin, maybe pressure to the body (e.g. if possible heavy jacket/vest or braces (suspenders? those old fashioned things to keep trousers up)) can help the kid to sense its corporal borders.

261,Help,"
        Have you discussed these concerns with your child's pediatrician?  This is always the best place to start.  Some of what is descibed could be characteristic of a child with ADHD, but I have no idea to what extent these reported behaviors occur--one teachers may see some mild issues and think they are indicative of ADHD, while another teacher could see the same behaviors and classify the child as ""a high-energy child""!  For all I know, some behaviors that you mentioned may just be indicative of a school with poor lunches and a boring curriculum!  So, start by asking the pediatrician, and see if he feels a referral to an individual who specializes in children with ADHD is warranted or not.

262,Is this going towards a diagnosis of ASD,"
        First, let me thank you for writing--I appreciate you taking the time to do so.  I am sorry if you were hoping for a more timely reply.

Your main question, seems to be whether or not your child will eventually be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder.  I'm not sure how old your son is, how long he has been in school, what services he has (or has not) received, thwe extent of his delays, etc., Given this (plus the fact that I have not met your son),  I cannot answer that question.  However, regardless of whether or not he has an ASD diagnosis, the important thing to focus on is, what can be done right now to ensure that my son has the best chance to maximize his potential.  My answer to that would be to use applied behavior analysis (ABA) as the main focus of his educational activities.  Although ABA has been documented to lead to the best outcomes for individuals with ASDs, this approach will be effective with any child with delays.

I'm not sure where you live, but some states have recently adopted legislation dictating that insurance must pay for autism treatment, including ABA.  I suggest you look into whether or not insurance reimbursement is available in your area (although it is possible that he would need an ASD diagnosis for this).  I would also suggest you talk to the school, and ask them if a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA; one who specializes in the assessment and treatment of children with ASDs) could consult on your son's case.  If you go to the Behavior Analyst Certification Board website (www.BACB.com), you can search for a BCBA in your area.  A qualified BCBA should be able to identify stimuli that will motivate your son to learn.  He or she will conduct assessments to attempt to identify why problem behavior occurs, which makes it much easier to treat.  He or she should be able to identify teaching strategies that will accelerate skill acquisition.

I hope some of this information is helpful.  Best of luck for you and your family.

266,how reliable are adult diagnosis of aspergers and autim,"
        You're right, it depends on the underlying model for autism sprectre disorders (ASD).

In Germany, the diagnosis of ASD is at least task of psychatrists. Psychologists do some basic tests; eye tracking experiments can give additional hints leading to ASD; MRI is made to exclude (visible) neurological issues. 
At least, an experienced psychatrist have an interview with the subject/patient, if available with its relatives about behaviours, biography (e.g. about beginning of speech)
To differentiate Asperger and HFA:
If you imagine a continuum of ASD beginning with early childhood autism...:

Early childhood autism (formerly ""CANNER"") --> Asperger --> High functioning autism HFA)

 you have an increase of (measurable!) intelligence
 you have an increase of social abilities/compatibility
According to this, you can differentiate Asperger and HFA with common test of intelligence. So, if the basic tests, the behavioural and biographical analysis lead to ASD, the diagnosis of Asperger is made with average intelligence and of HFA with intelligence above average.

About the accuracy of diagnosis: *** is a complex disorder - so some lacks in accuracy of diagnosis should be accepted.

I'm not mother tongue, so I hope my explanations are understandable.

268,meeting my Grandson with Aspergers,"
        Everyone handles these type of situations differently, so I can only tell you what I would do in this situation.  I would treat him the same way I would treat any child in a similar situation.  First, it is likely that he may not have any recollection of you--most children do not remember much about their lives when they were 3 years old.  Thus, I would begin slow, and I wouldn't necessarily rush towards him and give him a big hug when I first laid eyes on him!  Talk to him--ask him about what he likes to do, about what subjects in school he likes and dislikes.  Just spend some time getting to know him again.  Since he has a diagnosis of Asperger's, you may notice some quirky or odd behaviors--just ignore them, and accept them.  If you comment on them, or ask him why he did this or that, it may make him uncomfortable.  If he doesn't warm up to you immediately, understand that this is not a reflection of you; it is a reflection of his disorder.  Take it slow and do not push too hard.  Find a common ground, something that you both enjoy doing, and have that be the basis for a starting point for him to become more comfortable talking to you.

You have a rare opportunity to get to know your grandchild again, which many people in similar situations never get--don't worry about what to do or what to say.  Just enjoy getting to know him again, and hopefully it will be the beginning of a bonding process that will last forever.

I hope everything goes well for you.

269,"Hand flapping, speech delayed in a 4 yr old","
        I appreciate that you took the time to write regarding your grandson.  Obviously, I cannot make any definitive statements based upon the information you provided.  It will be important to keep the lines of communication open between you and your son, because if any action was to be taken, it would have to begin with a discussion with the child's pediatrician (and obviously, your son would have to initiate this first step).  The pediatrician should be made aware of the issue you describe, and it would likekly be helpful if your son asked about getting an outside evaluation with a professional who specializes in the assessment of yopung children.  It is possible that intervention may assist with his delayed speech.  

To address the hand movements, your son might consider giving your grandson a small toy or object to play with during times when he is expected to sit quietly, such as during church services.  It is difficult for most 4-year-olds to sit quietly for relatively long periods of time, so giving him something subtle to play with may compete with the hand flapping.

        If you have concerns, absolutely have your daughter assessed. Much of what you describe is not atypical for children her age but it sounds like there are ongoing issues. One thing to do immediately is to make sure she doesn't have the opportunity to be alone with your son if there's any possibility she might even inadvertently hurt him. I’m not hearing characteristics that suggest an autism spectrum disorder (i.e., deficits in social interaction and repetitive behavior patterns.

        What I tell every parent with concerns is, have your child assessed. There is no reason not to and it could be the first step in her recieving services that help her in areas that she finds to be challenging. That being said, if she's having some difficulties, it's a good idea to seek her some help with those particular issues, diagnosis or not. Autism-spectrum diagnoses are behavioral and there's always subjectivity in the decision making. The bottom line is, if your daughter could use help, make sure she gets it.

275,Toddler with autism symptons,"
        Thank you for taking the time to write to us.  First, I want to applaud you for what you have already done.  Whenever someone has questions about whether a child may or may not be on the autism spectrum, the first thing to do is to raise concerns to your pediatrician, which you have done.  You've secured some services already, and have a consult with a pediatric neurologist, which is great.  No one can read a brief description and give any meaningful input as to whether a child may or may not be on the spectrum, but if the consensus is that he is, I would immediately try to determine if there are any Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBA) in your area who specialize in the assessment and treatment of very young children with autism spectrum disorders.  You can find this out by going to the Behavior Analyst Certification Board website (www.bacb.com), and look to see if there are any such individuals in your area.  I would also check to see if any of these services can be funded through early intervention, and in some states your health insurance may pay for this.  Although there are many different treatments purported to be effective for treating children with autism, the only intervention that has a great deal of empirical support is applied behavior analysis.  The research also tells us that the early intervention begins, the better the outcomes.  The research also tells us that the number of hours of service provided also affects outcomes.  If less than 20 hours per week of early intensive behavior intervention are provided, the outcomes may not be as good as if 30 or even 40 hours per week are provided.

I hope some of this information is helpful.  Best of luck to you and your family.

        Personally, I don't put much faith in on-line testing.  The internet, while wonderful in mant ways, can alos provide people with a great deal of incorrect information.  My question is, why do you think you may have Aspergers?  What behaviors do you engage in that concern you?  More importantly, how much do they interfere with your everyday functioning?  Do you have a job?  Do you have friends?  Are you happy with your social interactions with others?  If you think you have deficits that impede your functioning, ask your doctor his or her opinion.  If the doctor feels you may indeed have Aspergers, ask yoour dotor if there is a social worker or therapist you can talk to, just to find out what resources are available in your area.

Have you have contact with school personnel about her behaviors?  Does she have problems dealing with other people in school?  If so, you should definitely mention this to the pediatrician.   You might also ask school personnel if they have any social skills training groups that she could be a part of--this may be helpful in teacher how to act more appropriately when interacting with her peers.

279,I got so Frusterated...,"
        I certainly understand your frustration, but it is important to remember not to blame yourself for your situation, and not to take any of this personally!  The first thing I would suggest is talking to your pediatircian, and see if there is any way he or she could help you get an evaluation a bit faster.  It would be important to make sure the individual doing the evaluation specializes in diagnosing young children with autism.  

I'm not sure where you live, but more and more states are making laws so that autism treatment must be paid for by insurance, so ask about this in your state.  You might also ask if it is possible to get a board certified behavior analyst, who specializes in working with very young children, to evaluate your son and see if he can help you develop strategies to deal with his challenging behavior.

I can't tell you why your son behaves the way he does.  But, many individuals engage in these types of behaviors beause a) they have significant communication deficits, so they cannot tell us what they want, and b) engaging in problem behavior becomes the most efficient way for them to get whatever they desire.  So, it is possible that your son, because he cannot tell you what he wants, engages in tantrums to get it!  what do you do to get him to stop when he acts out?  If you give his the item he wants, you may want to withhold the desired item when he tantrums, and try to teach him some appropriate way to get it--pointing, sign language, etc.  You can prctice doing this when he is being good--show him the Barney video, ask him if he wants it, make him point to it, and then give it to him.  This way, he gets what he wants by acting appropriately (in this example, pointing), and not for having a tantrum.  

Although we look at problem behavior and ask why anyon would act that way, remind yourself that what he is doing is trying to communicate to you what he wants.  However, to get it, he has to act in an appropriate manner, and he shouldn't get it when he tantrums.  This is why you need to practice before he tantrums--once he tantrums, if you give him the item, he'll only continue to learn that his problem behavior has a payoff!  Provide the payoff for appropriate behavior, withhold it for inappropriate behavior, and you'll be on your way to better behavior for your son.

        Thank you for taking the time to write about your daughter.  While it is not uncommon for 7-year-olds to be lacking in social skills, some of the behaviors you describe (e.g., engaging only in soletary play, skin picking until tissue damage occurs) are seen in some (but not all) children with Aspergers.  The first thing I would recommend is to discuss your concerns with your pediatrician.  Describe the behaviors that concern you, including her difficulties in school.  Ask him or her if there is anyone in your area who specializes in diagnosing children with Aspergers.  Also, talk to both your pediatircian and individuals from your daughter's school, and see if there are any board certified behavior analysts in your area who work with children with autism spectrum disorders.  Behavior anaysts have successfully developed interventions for children with autism that have improved social skills, play skills, and academic skills.

Best of luck with your daughter.

286,3.5 yr old boy Autism?,"
        If you have any concerns, I always recommend having the child assessed. There’s no reason not to. It’s impossible to make a diagnosis without seeing the child but many of the things you describe aren’t uncommon in typically developing children and the facts that your son plays well with his brothers and friends at home and is an effective communicator are all very positive signs. The thing to do, whether he ends up receiving an autism-spectrum disorder diagnosis or not, is to make sure he’s receiving help in the areas that he’s struggling. Additional tutoring and help with the eating issues could make a huge difference for him.

        Autism-spectrum disorders are characterized by impairments in social interaction and the presence of repetitive behavior patterns. It sounds like your son might be showing some of these and that you aren’t entirely comfortable with the way he’s been assessed to this point. If that’s true, there’s no reason at all not to have him assessed by someone else. This person should be a specialist who has experience diagnosing autism-spectrum disorders. The flip side of the coin is the fact that all of the problems that you describe (e.g., perseveration on wearing certain items of clothing, tantrums, self injury, etc…) are treatable. Make sure your son is receiving proper services to address these issues! With the right teaching environment, these kids can make really tremendous gains but it often falls on the parent to make sure that the child is receiving the services that he needs.

288,I think my son has Asperger's he is 6 and not yet potty trained,"
        My first recommendation for you is to have your son formally assessed for autism-spectrum disorders by a specialist with experience doing these diagnoses. I’m not sure what “signs of Asperger’s” means but finding out if your son should officially receive a diagnosis can be a good first step. 

Sometimes toilet training individuals with autism-spectrum disorders is more difficult than it is with typically developing peers. However, with the proper intervention, there is no reason at all that your son can’t be toilet trained now. In fact, while this training might be relatively intensive, it typically doesn’t take all that much time. Usually these teaching approaches involve giving the child a lot to drink in the morning, putting him in regular underwear rather than diapers, having him sit on the toilet very frequently (perhaps every 5-15 minutes) to try to catch elimination in the toilet before an accident happens, and then reinforcement of voiding in the toilet (typically with lots of praise and special treats). I highly recommend that you seek out a board certified behavior analyst in your area (www.bacb.com is a place to search) who has experience implementing toilet training programs with children like your son. This problem is definitely solvable!

289,Does my son have Aspergers?,"
        I appreciate you taking the time to write about your son.  I certainly understand why you are exhausted--I think any mother of 5 children would be!  You wrote that, ""I really don't know if these things are normal or not"", but you also said that ""you just know it's different from other kids"".  Some of the things you describe may not be typical of most children--but that doesn't necessarily mean that he has Asperger's!  

One of the first things I would suggest is discussing these concerns with your pediatrician.  be sure to describe his difficulties at school, and what his teachers have reported.  If your pediatrician is concerned, you could raise the question of whether or not their is someone in your general area who specializes in assessing and diagnosing children with Asperger's Syndrome.  Alsdo, ask your pediatician if he or she can recommend someone who you can talk to, who may be able to provide additional supports to you and your family.

If the school is planning on putting him into special education next year, you might consider asking to set up a meeting with individuals with the school, to ask about their plans for next year.  You should ask what additional supports, if any, can be provided for the remainder of this year.  I would inquire if the school provides any programming during the summer, as it may be beneficial for your son to receive at least some educational services during the summer.

I would also consider asking the school if they employ any consultants who are board certified behavior analysts, who may be able to provide recommendations about developing programs and modifying curricula that may promote more rapid learning, as well as programs to decrease some of the inappropriate behaviors thta he displays in school (e.g., talking out of turn, not stopping once he begins to talk, etc.).

Obviously, I cannot tell you how to best proceed with your son.  My suggestion, though, is to begin to find all the potential resources at your disposal--the pediatrician, the teachers, a local social worker, etc.--and see what resources are available to provide the best educational services to your son.

I wish you and your family the best of luck in your future endeavors.

290,Asperger's and Tourettes,"
        I appreciate you taking the time to write and ask about your son.  Some researchers have suggested that the incidence of Tourette Syndrome in individuals with autism is higher than what would be expected by chance.  However, some tics are nearly identical to the stereotypic behaviors emitted by some individuals with autism, and thus it is difficult to know if these behaviors are tics or not.

If you have significant concerns, you might look to see if there is a Movement Disorders Clinic nearby.  These specialists may be able to determine if these behaviors are symptomatic of Tourrette's syndrome or not.

Best of luck with your son.

291,could my 15month old have autisim,"
        I appreciate you taking the time to write.  Children develop at different rates, and reach certain milestones (e.g., walking, talking) at different ages.  It's impossible for me to read a short statement and offer opinions about whether the behaviors you describe may be early signs of autism or not.  So, the first thing I would suggest is to discuss these issues with your pediatrician.  Some of the behaviors you describe, such as rocking back and forth, are emitted occasionally by some typical children.   However, it will be important to discuss your concerns with your pediatrician.  You might also ask your pediatrician if there is anyone nearby who specializes in assessing and diagnosing autism in very young children.  If your pediatrician or the diagnostician suggests that your child may have an autism spectrum disorder, it will be important to investigate what type of early intervention services are available in your area,

For chaildren with autism, early intensive beahvioral intervention is extremely important.  If you do speak to someone about early intervention services, I would ask them if there are any Board Certified Behavior Analysts in your area, who have experience working with very young children (you can search for someone in your area at www.bacb.com).  He or she may be able to provide you with information regarding how to best manage your sons behavioral challenges. 

Best wishes for you and your family.

294,Your article lies,"
        Dear Dr. Graff,

I do not have the energy for a visceral response to what you wrote, but I can begin by telling you that I think Ms. Harrison answered you very well and I understand the anger Tsilla1777 feels about your comments and observations.

It tends to anger me that ever since Dr. Wakefield's study has been debunked, and incidentally, it was debunked not because its conclusions were wrong but because its methodology was unsound and scientifically invalid, ""concerned"" doctors and other health care professionals cannot wait for the opportunity to write columns on how stupid and gullible parents have been and continue to be.  But, before it was debunked, the vast majority of that same population refused to spend five minutes seriously considering that vaccines might be a problem.  Right there, that's a credibility problem, and it gives rise to a willingness on the part of parents to believe in what you dismiss as conspiracy theories.  If you bring a confirmation bias to the consideration of the question, your conclusions cannot be valid.

I agree with Ms. Harrison...I too saw the moment when my child went from a normal, healthy baby to a child who stared into space and did not respond to her name.  My child is 11-years-old now and the exact age she was is cloudy to me, but she was 1 1/2 to 2 years old.  She received several vaccines in one day and it is therefore impossible to know which vaccine caused the problem.  The same thing happened to her younger sister a few years later when we were STILL not believing fully what our own senses were showing us precisely because of the arrogant, self-serving opinions of doctors on the subject of vaccines.  No intelligent person wants to be classified as a villager with a pitchfork, and we certainly do not want to fight with our pediatricians, which I have had to do any number of times, or be classified as bad parents.  So, we partially ignored what we know, to the detriment of our children.  But I will say this.  Whereas with my elder child, I let the doctor convince me to continue to vaccinate albeit ""more slowly,"" with my older child, when it happened to my younger child, I stopped.  Today, I have one child who is autistic and one who is not.  The one who is not received fewer vaccines even before the day when she seemed to react as her sister did, which I believe explains why that reactive incident knocked one into autism and the other not.

My husband had a co-worker who simply could not understand why we do not vaccinate our children, until her son wound up in the hospital and almost died from a blood infection related to his DTaP vaccine.  Then she said to my husband, ""I understand now why you don't vaccinate your kids.  I'll never do it again.""  Did you hear me say that it was DTaP that almost caused the death of that child, not the MMR vaccine?

The truth of the matter is that the worst thing Dr. Wakefield did was to create the mother lode of all red herrings around the issue of vaccine safety.  Dr. Graff, the MMR vaccine is not the only problem.  

Are you listening?

The Thimerisal in the MMR vaccine (and others) is not the only problem, though it is a problem.  It is also a problem that my elder daughter's original pediatrician looked me in the face and promised me in 1999 that Thimerisal was not a problem because it had been removed.  It wasn't removed until 1999 and the vials already containing it were not discarded.  I was still seeing package inserts with Thimerisal years after the fact.

Are you listening?

Vaccines contain any number of impurities and additives, the vast majority of which a parent could be sent to prison for forcing their child to ingest.  It is unknown and has not been fully researched what effect these vaccines have in certain children over a period of time.

Did you hear me?

Would you hear HIM?:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atPYt4xes80

 Incidentally, it's egotistical to say that nobody is going to believe you until you are invited on Oprah.  Do you honestly believe you are saying anything original?  Do you honestly believe we haven't been forced to listen to other people saying exactly what you do?  It is sadly entirely legitimate to see conspiracies around this subject.  The pharmaceutical industry makes huge amounts of money from vaccines.  Pediatricians lose about 90% of their practices without vaccines -- and that's a conservative estimate.  Physicians all too often rely entirely on the word of their pharmaceutical sales representatives to tell them what is in a medication and what it does.  Insurance companies? I have no idea how they make money.  They seem to pay out much more than they take in to me given how crazily expensive medical care is, but clearly there is some part of that equation I am not considering.  What I do know is that they pay for vaccines but refuse to pay for immune titers to either test for the need for a vaccine or test to see if a vaccine even worked after it was administered, so if there were ever to be a time when vaccines were ALLOWED to be proven to be dangerous, all of these groups would face staggering liability lawsuits.  You're lying to yourself and to us if you do not think that would motivate a group of people to want to debunk something before it got serious consideration.

Thank you for your time.

It is upsetting to have a child with autism because you feel helpless to ""fix"" it and you want to know why this had to happen to your perfectly normal child all the sudden--perhaps you want something to blame so it makes more sense--but vaccinations help more people than they allegedly harm.

        As a parent I can truly understand the controversy over to vaccinate or not vaccinate.  I have two daughters and both has been vaccinated.  At the time my oldest received her vaccinations there wasn’t this big controversy over this issue, however when my youngest was born the controversy was in full swing.  I talked with our Pediatrician and voiced my concerns and asked if my daughter could get her vaccinations one at a time rather receiving 4 at one time.  This allowed me to monitor any affects from the different vaccines.  As for the MMR she received 3 different individual shots rather than receiving the one combined shot.  No reactions at all with receiving the vaccines in this manner.  I fully understand how this article has touched a nerve for many; however, I don’t think we should not continue to visit this site as it has offered great information in the past.  It also allows everyone the opportunity to voice their concerns and many can learn from the opinions, and experience everyone post.

        The thing is, we didn't notice a relatively immediate reaction in our children after any of those substances, which, by the way, I try to avoid giving them as much as I can. 

If we are to discuss the full scope of the vaccine debate, it involves understanding that there are possibly some children who are unable to process these vaccine ingredients particularly because they have acquired environmental toxicity passed through in utero or even in early childhood.  Unfortunately, powerful interests stand in the way of ever truly exploring and studying that.  It is a travesty where the children are the victims and we should all be upset.

        Thanks for many of your support, as some of you have similar stories. I feel for your situations as well.
As for wanted to know what my kid eat as perhaps a cause. Out of 4 kids and 4 grandkids, they all eat typical stuff and I have not noticed such an abrupt immediate and devasting reaction to any cereal or macaroni and cheese like I did with little Colten.
Also, parents aren't just trying to find something to blame.... I know society does that in general. It is funny because parents all over the world with autistic children can see the obvious side effects of these 'over' immunizations and science WON""T listen to them.
This only makes parents more eager to share THESE side effects since SCIENCE won't warn others. Also isn't SCIENCE suppose to take in consideration the evaluations of others? Isn't observation PART of science?
I am NOT against vaccines, not at all, but in the doses and very early ages of children it is ridiculous. AND parents don't have a say. The government requires all children to get so many shots before they attend school. Parents have no right to refuse (with out a real fight, like me). I was threatened with police and CPS if I didn't CONTINUE to immunize my autistic child. Of course I got the media and school board involved and finally they accepted a 'religious waiver' in protest.
I asked the school, if my child suffered dangerous side effects from immunizations who would be held responsible... the school? the state? the federal government? the CDC? No one wanted accountability, but I was suppose to ignore the side effects and be coorced into the shots anyway. Why even have a 'side effects' waiver to sign?
Parents informed discretion is best. Why not leave it at the 6 immunizations I had as a child that were to stop the spread of fatal and infectious diseases.... not things like the chicken pox (which I survived quite well).
I hope sharing our stories will make 'science' think, but even tho most of their facts are based on theory, it is based on controlling the masses.

Chemcials we breathe"" would like to know how we can go about facing this and preventing this problem""  Do we just strap a mask on our children each and everyday they walk out the house?

Now like I said I don't disagree here but the main problem we face is not only the food/air/vaccines/etc, but pretty much everything our children come into contact with.  We can sit here and point fingers all we want for what we believe is the cause of such tramatic disorders/mental illnesses/diseases, etc...that may be caused by all of these. But we need to stay focused and protect our children and not single one idea out.  We need to tackle all this as a whole and make sure that we all realize that everything we do affects our children and every action of thier own also reflects and makes a difference.  This does not mean you need to go out and be over protective of them but do your own homework and stand up for what you feel is right.  

In other words I agree with you all, as the only feeling I can not relate is what most of you are going through with your children.  My kids at this very moment ""appear"" to be fine however and I quote that strongly only hoping these very symptoms do not arrise later in life. At this point all I can do is research and come to my own conclusions for what I think is best to protect my children from all this.  Good luck to you all, but again its not one specific blame its everything as a whole.

How can the medical community ignore this??  Several of these children's parents are MDs who now agree that vaccinations are too risky.

My daughter, herself, was diagnosed w/ a reaction to her own DPT vaccine in 1985. 2 weeks following her vaccine when she was around 8 mos old, her Aunt Carolyn, who was babysitting, found her lethargic, in her crib following a nap.  Had it not been for Carolyn's checking in on her, she may have been another SIDS statistic!  Following that episode, she received DT vaccines.  Had I known then what I know now, she would have never had another vaccine of any kind under the age of 10 yrs old.  

My daughter has recently given birth to an infant son of her own. She and her husband have decided against infant/child vaccines. I applaud their courage!

        There is no way to answer this other than to just note that everyone is an individual. You know your son far better than I do and you’re in a much better position to speak to his strengths and weaknesses. All of the ASD diagnoses are behavioral. They don’t tell you about causes, they just apply a name to a cluster of behavioral criteria. Everyone with an Asperger’s diagnosis is different, some lead very typical lives, others have more difficulties. Almost anything is possible but the thing to do is to make sure he gets whatever help he needs to continue to work on areas in need of improvement. Deal with individual issues rather than the diagnosis as a whole. He’s your son and an adult and should probably be treated like one. But, that doesn’t mean that, like anyone really, he doesn’t need the support and assistance of his parents. The thing to do is to keep an eye on things, help him recognize the things he could use more help with, and make sure he seeks out the assistance he needs.

Some behavior problems, in both children with autism and typically developing children, occur because these behaviors become efficient ways for them to get what they want.   For example, you said that has temper tantrums when he cannot have his own way.  What happens when he has a tantrum--does he end up getting what he wants?  If so, the tantrum, although inappropriate from our point of view, becomes an efficient way to get what he wants.  In the short term, giving in to him is the easy way to end the tantrum; in the long run, however, he may learn that tantrumming when he is denied access to a desired item is a great way to get that item!   I think many of us have seen a similar situation in a supermarket, where a parent is pushing their child in the shopping cart, and when they go down the aisle with candy, the child asks for some. The parent says no, and the child begins to tantrum.  Then, the parent gives in, and gives the child the candy, just to stop the tantrum.  Although in the short run the longer tantrum is avoided (which is understandable when others in the store start staring at the parent and tantrumming child), what happens in the long run is that the child leanrs that tantrumming when a request is denied is an efficient way to get what you want--and it may be the MOST efficient way to get what you want!

Other behavior problems can occur because they become efficient ways for children to avoid situations that they do not want to be in.  So, if your grandson is asked to greet someone, and he hides, he has successfully avoided the situation.  My son used to claim that he was sick and could not go to school when he had a test.  This was his way to try to avoid the unpleasant situation.  If I always let him stay home every time this happened, you know what the result would have been--he would always claim to be sick when he had a test.  Why?  Because it worked!   But, by not giving in to him when he did this, he stopped even trying, because the behavior did not work to get what he wanted.  My point is that some behaviors become very efficient ways to avoid unpleasant situations or activities.

If the pediatrician feels that your grandson may have autism, you should try to find a board certified behavior anaylst in your area, who has expertise in the assessment and treatment of childhood behavior problems (you can find one at www.bacb.com).  A skilled behavior analyst may be able to identify exactly why your grandson's behavior problems occur, and provide you with suggestions on how to best deal with these.

I wish you best of luck in the future.

312,does my 3yr old have autism,"
        Based on your description I would say that you have some cause for concern, both because of his aggressive and destructive behaviors and because he sounds as though he shows some characteristics that suggest a possible autism spectrum diagnosis (language delays, possible social skills delays as well as somewhat restricted interests).  However, only an in-person evaluation by a specialist can determine whether the diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder is appropriate. Whether or not an autism diagnosis is appropriate, it sounds as though you need help addressing his aggressive and destructive behaviors. I’d recommend that you describe your concerns to your pediatrician and ask him/her whether further evaluation is warranted.
Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including autism, Asperger’s, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests.  Your description suggests that his language acquisition is delayed, and that there may be some delays in social interaction skills and stereotyped interests.  However, there is a fair range in what is considered normal (and it’s not clear without some direct observation whether his behavior falls outside of that range).  It sounds as though your concerns are as much about his problematic behavior – aggressive and destructive behavior – as the delays in social and communicative skills.  Whether or not your son is diagnosed with an autism disorder, you might want to consider getting some professional help addressing his aggressive behaviors. A Board-Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) will help you identify strategies to help reduce those problematic behaviors and teach more adaptive responses, regardless of your child's diagnosis.  A local BCBA can be found at the following website: http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html.   The BCBA will want to know more about the conditions surrounding problem behavior.  For example, you noted that he tends to have a tantrum when a preferred TV show ends (or you turn it off).  Are those the only times he has tantrums, or does he tend to have tantrums whenever preferred activities end?  This type of information will help the BCBA develop strategies for dealing with your son’s behavior.
Best of luck to you and your family.

313,is it aspergers,"
        Asperger’s Syndrome is characterized by narrow or repetitive patterns of behavior or interests and severe and sustained impairment in social interactions. It doesn’t sound as though he really fits that profile – he has friends (even if he sometimes would prefer to be alone) and has lots of interests (even if he again has some preferences for certain topics).  This suggests that Asperger’s syndrome isn’t a likely diagnosis.  It sounds as though your concerns relate to more subtle aspects of his social interaction skills – but keep in mind that 9 year-olds aren’t necessarily known for their subtle social skills. There is a broad range in what is considered normal social skills for this age and it sounds to me as though your son falls within it. However, for peace of mind, you could express your concerns to your pediatrician – only a professional who sees your child in person will be able to provide you with an accurate diagnosis. 

Also keep in mind that with or without a diagnosis of Asperger's, you would probably use the same methods to address the social ""quirkiness"": Model good social skills yourself (so he can see how to gracefully handle social situations), give him opportunities to practice good socials skills by supporting his attempts to find (and keep) friends, and provide feedback and help when he isn't reacting appropriately to a situation (help him ""talk thru"" frustrating or other emotionally charged situation).

Best of luck to you and your family

314,Could my son have asperger's syndrome/disorder?,"
        Autism is characterized by severe impairment in social interaction skills, communication skills, and/or stereotyped (ritualistic) behaviors, interests, and activities.  Asperger’s Disorder has a similar profile (restricted interests, delayed or inhibited social interaction skills), but without the developmental and language delays seen in children with a diagnosis of autism.  Only a trained professional who has conducted an in-person assessment can provide an accurate diagnosis.  Your description does seem to suggest that he shows fairly restricted interests and may have some social interaction problems, but it’s hard to tell whether this really falls outside the range of normal and whether he would meet criteria for Asperger’s (or other diagnoses). 

It also sounds as though your concern is as much about problematic behavior as it is about diagnosis. Regardless of his diagnosis, childhood behavior problems can usually be addressed through consultation with a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA).  If you feel that his behavior is stigmatizing or interfering with more adaptive behaviors, you may want to consult with a BCBA.  This professional will want to spend time directly observing your child as well as interviewing your family, so that they can provide recommendations on how to best address the issue. Local BCBAs can be found at the following site: http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html

315,Could my son have asperger's syndrome/disorder?,"
        Hi, I saw your note, I am not a medic, however I have researched this topic a huge amount. I have been trying to work out if a friend (b/f) who is 30yrs+ has undiagnosed autism/aspergers. There  have been many odd things.

I have to say from your description it is very likely the things you describe are symptoms of it:
sensitivity to noise/taste
flapping
eye contact issues
poor social relations and emotional skills/control

- please note there are special schools that cater for such children if diagnosed with this.

All the best.

316,Is it autism or speech/language delayed ?,"
        Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including Autism, Aspergers, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests.  It is difficult to tell the extent of a problem from a description, but what you are describing (diminished eye contact) might fall within a range of typical behavior or might be an indicator of problems with social interaction skills.  However, your subsequent description suggests that she has regular social exchanges – so it sounds as though there is a good chance the issue is limited to language delays at this time.

Direct evaluation by a qualified professional is necessary for any diagnosis.  For your peace of mind, I’d suggest that you describe your concerns to your pediatrician and ask whether s/he thinks that referral to a specialist for further evaluation is necessary. They may recommend further evaluation, or they might find her development to be relatively normal.  If they don’t recommend follow-up and you still don’t see improvement within a few months, you might want to bring your concerns back to your pediatrician and ask again for a referral to a specialist.

318,Zoloft to treat mood swings in 6 year old with HF Autism,"
        It is difficult to answer a question like this without having access to additional information, but the first thing I would want to know is, who is developing his behavior plan at school?  You mentioned that he was receiving 1:1 services, but most 1:1 support staff are simply trying to implement behavior plans written by others.  In many schools, behavior plans are written by a special educator, sometimes with input from a consultant.  I think it is really important to have the plan written by someone with significant experience in using applied behavior analysis with children with autism (you can search for board certified behavior analysts in your region at www.bacb.com).  It is really crucial that the behavior intervention plan matches the reason your son is acting out.  For example, some children act out when they are given difficult wotrk to do.  This is certainly understandable--it's frustrating to be asked to do work that is hard for you!  Some children may tantrum when they are given hard work, and some classroom teachers may send the child to a quiet room to calm down, or to the principle's office.  Unfortunately, this means that the child has successfully avoided the hard work by acting out!  Although the classoom teacher did what may have seemed like the right thing to do in the short run, it actually may make the problem behavior worse in the wrong run--and the child may learn that, whenever they are giving anything that they don't wantt o do, they can get out of doing it by tantrumming!  So, it is important that the behavior program is written such that it takes into account WHY the problem behavior is occurring--and this is exactly what behavior analysts are trained to do.  few special educators receive this type of training (and I am not biased against special education teachers--I am married to one!).  

I hope this was helpful.  Best of luck in the future.

322,abnormal acts....autism??,"
        It would be impossible to diagnose him without seeing him but, it sounds like having him assessed would be a good idea. A place to start is asking your pediatrician for a referral, you’re looking for a professional with experience diagnosing individuals who have autism. It sounds like he has an IEP already? The diagnosis can be helpful in making sure that he is receiving the services that he needs and that includes both with regard to academic work and also learning appropriate socialization. If you feel that he needs help in a certain area, make sure that it’s addressed on the IEP. I often find that the best way to think about it is in terms of making sure that your stepson is getting help for the things he struggles with regardless of diagnosis. There are services out there and professionals available that can help him with just the sorts of problems that you’re describing.

324,Concerned,"
        Since you mention that your son has already been seeing a speech therapist and an OT, I am going to assume that you are receiving these services through your local Early Intervention Program (EIP).  Has your son’s pediatrician or anyone at the EIP recommended any additional assessment and treatment?  Whether or not they have, if you feel that your son may have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), I recommend that you try to find a clinic that specializes in children with ASDs for further assessment.  (Talking to your son’s pediatrician or the local EIP may help with this.)  

Certainly some of the behaviors that you describe may or may not be indicative of the early signs of an ASD (remember that, particularly at a very young age, there is quite a bit of variability in growth and development).  Based on what you describe, however, I would not say that you are being “over concerned.”  Below are several websites with information about ASD.  You may find it helpful to review these sites to see if you think you need to take your son in for further assessment.

Regarding the delay in speech, recently I posted a reply to a somewhat similar question (i.e., a big part of the question they had was about delayed speech) and I found a website (below) at the National Institutes of Health that has a section on typical speech and language development.  It includes checklists that help you determine if your child is “on track” with communication development as well as definitions and some explanations of potential speech and language developmental problems and what to do about them.  You should also ask your son’s speech therapist for advice on what to do on an ongoing basis to promote communication by your son.

        At least some of your son’s behavior does not sound outside of the range of typical development.  For example, I have included a link to a website below at the National Institutes of Health regarding typical speech and language development.  It includes checklists that help you determine if your child is “on track” with communication development as well as definitions.  On the other hand some, of the behaviors (i.e., not paying attention to you) might be an indication of some developmental problems.  One point that I want to make is that many of the behaviors you are describing can be typical of any developing two-year-old child (and the younger the child is, the wider the range of these behaviors may be).  It usually comes down to the frequency of these behaviors that is indicative of a problem.  Below are several websites with information about autism spectrum disorders (some specific to early identification).  You may find it helpful to review these sites and see if your concerns are valid.  

Pediatricians are usually the first contact point for accessing additional assessments and services, and apparently she did not think something was different enough to refer you to a local Early Intervention Program (EIP) for further assessment and treatment?  Although her recommendation was to wait, I strongly suggest that if you notice any decrease in your son’s development you contact the pediatrician at that time and not wait.

327,Speech delays,"
        As you describe your niece, it does seem as though her speech and social behavior may be delayed.  Have her parents had her assessed by her pediatrician and/or her local educational authority (LEA)?  If a child is suspected of having developmental delays, they are entitled to a CORE evaluation by the LEA (usually the local school district) as soon as they reach the age of three years.  What you describe may be any number of potential problems or just a delayed development.  What do her parents think?  I always recommend that parents with any concern about their child’s development contact their pediatrician.  A child’s pediatrician is often the first contact in getting additional assessments and help, if that is needed.
For your reference, I have included a website link below to the National Institutes of Health that has a section on typical speech and language development.  It includes checklists that help you determine if your niece is “on track” with communication development as well as definitions and some explanations of potential speech and language developmental problems and what to do about them.

328,Play that is odd in intensity or focus?,"
        From what you are describing, it does seen as though your son’s play behavior is unusual.  The repetitiveness of the play (both your description of him doing the same thing for hours and that it is the same topic/theme every time) is concerning.  You mentioned that it is difficult to get him to do anything else.  When you try, does he get upset?  Also, when he is playing with the blocks and cars, it sounds like he is playing alone and not in a social context (e.g., with you or a peer).  I think that you are probably correct in being somewhat concerned and I strongly recommend that you take him to his pediatrician.  It would probably be a good idea when making the appointment to speak with the doctor or nurse and provide some examples of your concerns (like you did in your question) so the doctor is prepared for what to assess.  A child’s pediatrician is often the first contact in getting additional assessments and help, if that is needed.  Also, what do your son’s teachers say about his behavior in school?  Teachers often have an excellent perspective regarding a child’s social and play behavior in addition to knowing the academic status.  I would definitely ask to speak with his teacher and just ask a few general questions about how your son is doing and who are his friends, what does he like to do at school, etc.  Sometimes children go through a period where they are over focused on a single topic or activity, and then it changes.  Given your son’s age and the description of his play, I would not wait to find out.  Talking with your school professionals and his pediatrician can only either alleviate your concerns or help to find help. Either way, it is in your son’s best interest to act now.

The behaviors you are describing may be the early signs of ASD, particularly if your child’s pediatrician has ruled out other factors (e.g., hearing problems).  Below are several websites with information about autism spectrum disorders (both specific to early identification and information regarding the best treatment for ASDs).  You may find it helpful to review these sites to see if you think you need to take your son in for further assessment.  If you think that your son is on the spectrum, then it is important to get help as soon as possible.  Again, I would look to your local governmental agencies (medical, educational, child welfare) to see if there are any services you can take advantage of.

In the meantime, independent of your grandson’s diagnosis, it sounds like there are a number of problem behaviors that require help in managing.  

One other thing you could do is look into finding a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) to help with the behavior problems.  Based on your description of the behavior of your grandson, I strongly recommend that a BCBA be a part of an education and treatment team.  You can go to the Behavior Analyst Certification Board’s website (http://www.bacb.com/) to see if there is one near where you live; or at least to see what types of qualifications you should be looking for in someone to help you. Another website with a great deal of information on a behavior analytic approach to working with children can be found at the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies (http://www.behavior.org/).

333,can a pa-c diagnos  Neuro issues??,"
        First, I think that the question of whether your health care professional is qualified to diagnose a particular condition is dependent upon their training, experience, and the local standards and regulations regarding diagnosis (but I would be most interested in the first two factors).  Second, it is always a difficult situation when a person has a concern about a child’s development, and the parent of that child doesn’t agree with what you are saying.  This isn’t any easier when it is a family member and therefore may be even more emotionally charged.  In your case, you clearly disagree with what the family’s PA - C is saying.  Perhaps you could find a way to calmly discuss your concerns regarding the diagnosis and suggesting that they see a specialist.  In your grandson’s case, I suggest starting with a qualified speech and language pathologist.  Alternatively, perhaps there is a mutual friend or, another family member who can speak with your grandson’s parents.  

Recently I posted a reply to a somewhat similar question (i.e., a big part of the question concerned delayed speech) and I found a website (below) at the National Institutes of Health that has a section on typical speech and language development.  It includes checklists that help you determine if your child is “on track” with communication development.  This information might be helpful in checking on your grandson’s progress and recommended treatments.  

http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/speechandlanguage.html#mychild


As far as the behavioral problems are concerned, is your grandson being seen by a behavior analyst or other professional to help him and his parents manage the problems behaviors you describe?  Is your grandson enrolled in a local preschool program? In the USA, at age three and above children with any diagnosed special needs are entitled to at least an assessment and possibly services by their local educational authority (usually your local city or town school).  
For additional information about behavioral approaches to managing and teaching children with special needs, I have included the website address for the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies.  I think you may find information on behavior analytic approaches to behavior problems helpful (bedtime issues are common, often exasperating for parents, and very treatable).

334,Possible autism or just a typical 3 yr old,"
        A month or so ago I answered a very similar question, and this is basically what I wrote.  The first question I ask almost every time I hear about a child like your son is: have you already taken him to the pediatrician, and what does he or she think?  Did your son’s pediatrician think something was different enough to refer you to a local Early Intervention Program (EIP) for further assessment and treatment?  If you and the doctor feel that you son may have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), I recommend that you try to find a clinic that specializes in children with ASDs for further assessment.  Talking to your son’s doctor or the local EIP may help with this.  I don’t know where you live, but in the US, as soon as a child with a suspected developmental disability turns three years of age, the local educational authority (usually your local city or town school) is responsible for doing an educational assessment to determine if the child qualifies for special education services at that time.  Again, if he is seen by the EIP, they can help with a transition to these services.  You should check with your local government social services and educational agencies for the procedures where you live.  

Also, some of the other behaviors that you mentioned may or may not be indicative of the early signs of an ASD.  Below are several websites with information about ASD.  You may find it helpful to review these sites to see if you think you need to take your son in for further assessment, etc.

335,what to do,"
        Like all kids, children diagnosed with autism need to learn what sexual behavior is and isn’t appropriate. The type of behavior you describe isn’t entirely uncommon and it’s typically addressed through arranging consistent consequences. Sometimes this might entail delivering reinforcers at set intervals as long as the behavior hasn’t happened or arranging special rewards each time a person is interacted with appropriately and clearly telling the child that the inappropriate behavior isn’t ok. This is something that can be practiced by describing the contingency then going out in the community and arranging lots of opportunities for appropriate interaction and then reinforcing each success. This is a behavior that I’ve seen effectively treated numerous times and one that is typically sensitive to this sort of reinforcement-based treatment.

        There are many, many parents like you with children who almost meet criteria for diagnosis. Certainly consider having him reassessed if you feel that the difficulties he’s having haven’t being adequately seen by previous professionals who assessed him. Perhaps the most important advice I can give you is that a diagnosis is just a label, not a solution. If he’s struggling in some areas, seek out services to help him in those areas. Things like poor eye contact, tantruming, gross motor, fine motor, and speech delays can all be addressed. It sounds like he’s already receiving some services but find more for him if he has challenges that his current services aren’t targeting. There are behavior analysts and therapists who have experience working with children just like your son and remarkable progress can be made. Treat each of his challenges individually and do your best to find services to address each of them.

        Dear concerned Mommy, I understand and totally relate to your concerns concerning your son.  I am the grandmother of a 7 year old little boy who demonstrates many of the exact characteristics that you indicate are present in your son.  My grandson has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.  However, in addition to the similarilies that the two boys share, my grandson is deaf, mute, has a sleeping and eating disorder, is severely developmentally delayed (cognitively functions are that of an 18 month old).  He also has failed to intergrate socially and appears to be in a world of his own.  He too is a sweet an lovable little fellow, unfortunately, he does not interact socially enough with anyone for one to realize just how lovable he truly is.  Further, my grandson is a true miracle and blessing from God as he has never eaten food of any type a day in his life.  Where it not for Pedia Sure, I shudder to think what would happen to him as it is his only source of nutrients.  It can be extremely frustrating when you have one of these truly special gifts from God, and physician, therapist, etc., seem to have little or no understanding of them.  Just no that you are not alone, if it is okay with you, I would like to list you as a friend and perhaps we can share in some of the interventions that we have experienced and the outcome thereof.

Good Luck and God will continue to bless you and your special little one.

        If your nephew is diagnosed with PDD, he should have an individualized education plan (IEP) that lays out personalized objectives for his learning for each school year and the services that he needs that the school will be providing. If he isn’t in a special needs class, but he needs to be, his parents or guardians have to make sure that it’s in his IEP. There are meetings between parents and representatives from the school in which IEPs are developed yearly but those meetings can be convened at any time if a child isn’t receiving appropriate service and the document has to be signed by parents or guardians. If his parents/guardians believe he isn’t receiving the services that he needs, they need to bring it to the attention of the school system and fight to make sure those services are provided. Unfortunately, sometimes this requires bringing in expert consultants or attorneys, but it s something that parents/guardians have to demand and that schools are required by law to respond to.

        You bring up a good question, getting skills to generalize is an important and often overlooked part of teaching. It’s a great sign that you’re getting communication improvements at home and you can absolutely program to help with generalization. One good way to do it is to arrange plenty of opportunities for her to speak to novel people, prompt, and have lots of reinforcement for any talking that you can catch. Friends and family can be great for standing in for “novel” people and you can supplement this with lots of prompting and reinforcement for speech in new places with you or your husband. If you can get her saying something to you in a new place with other people around, that’s a great step!

        We often get questions about diagnosis and there isn't currently a blood test that can identify autism. I reccomend bringing your child to a specialist in diagnosing autism.  Developmental pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, child psychiatrists, and child psychologists may all be appropriately trained.  The person providing the diagnosis should have experience in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders.  Your pediatrician, local hospital, or school district should be able to refer you to a qualified individual.  Regardless of who you are seeing, make sure that the diagnosis and the reasons for it are fully explained to you.  You shouldn't find yourself walking away confused about the diagnosis.  If you have any concerns, seek a second opinion and find a diagnostician you trust and are comfortable with.

Any issue with medication being taken correctly is an extremely important one and something that should not be let go. My advice is to get that addressed immediately.

Recently I posted a reply to a somewhat similar question (i.e., a big part of the question they had was about delayed speech) and I found a website (below) at the National Institutes of Health that has a section on typical speech and language development.  It includes checklists that help you determine if your child is “on track” with communication development.

        Realizing that doctor has already diagnosed your son with autism, did he or she suggest any further assessments to better define your son’s needs?  I almost always recommend that a child who has been newly diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) be seen by a team of educators and clinicians who specialize in ASD.  There has been much debate as to whether any “cure” exists for ASDs, but one thing that is clear is that there is empirically demonstrated treatment to vastly improve the condition and that is applied behavior analysis.  Below are several websites with information about ASDs that you might find informative (even though your son is diagnosed, I included sites containing information about early identification because I thought you might find some of the links helpful).  I am not sure what services are available in Belgium, but regarding the current placement for your son, I encourage you to work closely with the educational professionals responsible for your son’s placement to make sure it is the best one for him.  The treatment of individuals with ASD requires highly specialized interventions that are likely not available in a center for “disabled children” (I am not sure what you mean by the term).  There are also references for books that you might find helpful (both is learning more about ASDs and effective treatment) at the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies website.

        I’m not sure what exactly is scheduled to be done at the assessment you describe, so it’s hard for me to comment on it. I can say, however, that the self-injury and aggression you describe can be effectively treated. An assessment of his problem behavior should provide information about why the behavior is happening (this would be determined by an assessment called a functional analysis), what interventions would be expected to be successful, and also a treatment evaluation. Twelve weeks is more than enough time to identify causes for his self injury and aggression and also to begin to implement an intervention to test its effectiveness. 

The most important question for you to ask the individuals who will be assessing him is “how will this help his self injury and aggression when he returns home?” Make sure that they will be conducting a functional analysis of his problem behavior and assessing treatment effectiveness and make sure that they will be showing you the data that they collect and explaining them to you. If this sort of assessment is worthwhile, the end product will be you and your son’s other caregivers learning how to effectively handle his problem behavior. Assessments of this sort can be extremely useful if they include a functional analysis, treatment evaluation, and training for you and other caregivers.

        It isn’t clear, from what you are saying, that an autism-spectrum diagnosis would be appropriate for your son. Those diagnoses essentially depend upon the child having deficits in communication and displaying repetitive behavior patterns. If you have concerns, however, I recommend having him assessed. Also, his shyness and hesitancy to join into activity with peers is something that can be worked on. If you’re concerned about it and you feel like it’s holding him back, seek out a clinician with experience working with children like your son.

        Having a child with special needs can be extremely stressful and making sure that your child gets the services he needs can be a struggle. It sounds like you’ve done just the right thing for your boys so far. Early intervention is extremely important and can have a huge impact. If your son has a PDD diagnosis, he should have an IEP that lays out the educational goals for him for the year and the services that he’ll be receiving. If he’s in a typical classroom but is receiving services to address his needs, than that may very well be sufficient. However, if you are seeing clear needs that aren’t being addressed by the school, keep fighting to get them and seek those services out right away.

360,Autism and erections,"
        A typical approach to dealing with children diagnosed with ASDs who are masturbating in inappropriate places is to teach them where and when the behavior is acceptable. This often involves blocking the behavior and redirecting to either a location in which it is more acceptable or an alternative activity. In addition to this, it can be effective to arrange additional reinforcers for him going for periods of times without any form of public masturbation (i.e., a reward at the end of each hour or couple of hours for good behavior). This isn’t an uncommon issue and it’s one that I’ve seen successfully treated many times. If this is a continuing problem, I suggest finding a board-certified behavior analyst in your area who has experience working with children like your son.

Eye contact - it's very limited.  He wont make eye contact when upset and he certainly won't let you touch him when he's upset.  On the other hand, I am the only one who he will let hold him when he's upset and even then it's for a short time.

        Your son sounds a lot like mine.  He is going to be two next week and he does not have any words yet.  He used to say a few words when he was a year old, but lost that ability.  He also grunts a lot and hums.  He's also very happy and loves to laugh and play, and even seeks us out for ""chasing"" games, but otherwise he likes to run around the house (or down the sidewalk) and plays by himself.  He does not know how to play with a toy appropriately, rather, he spins wheels, takes pieces off of the puzzles (without ever putting them back on) and throws blocks around.  
He's been evaluated by early childhood development and they have placed him in a toddler autism characteristics group.  Their opinion was devastating to me, but I knew deep down that he needed their help.  What is most important is not the label (and I know that's tough to get over) but that he get the help he needs.  
Whether he's on the spectrum or not, it won't hurt him to get specialized help with speech, communication and eye contact.  At his age, it's provided by your state - and paid for by your taxes - so there's no reason not to look into it.

        It sounds to me like you have been looking at some information, somewhere, about diagnostic categories (most people I meet don’t ask about a differential diagnosis of selective mutism versus autism).  Based on you descriptions of your son’s behavior, it might be either of those, or actually just behavior within the typical range of development.  

I feel that the best advice I can give to parents with concerns like yours is to check with your son’s pediatrician thinks about what he or she thinks about your son’s development.  If you feel strongly that your son’s behavior is atypical and not improving, I suggest that you explain your concerns to him or her and ask for a referral for a developmental assessment.  Hopefully, your son’s doctor will agree that further assessment is necessary.  I recommend that you ask the pediatrician for help in finding an assessment team familiar with young children and autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  Furthermore, since your son is already over three years of age, the local education authority (LEA; your town or city school district that you live in) is responsible for performing a CORE assessment if you request one.  Contact your son’s school for information on how to initiate this process.

In the meantime, below are several websites with information about autism spectrum disorders (some specific to early identification).

With regard to a diagnosis, I suggest you talk with your son’s pediatrician and ask to have your son referred to your local education authority (LEA; your town or city school district that you live in) for further assessment, or specialists familiar with children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).  If upon further assessment, the examiners feel that your son may have an ASD, then I recommend that you take him to a clinic that specializes in children with ASDs for further assessment.  If you live in the United States, since your son is already over three years of age, the LEA is responsible for performing a CORE assessment if you request one.  Contact your son’s school for information on how to initiate this process.  (Note: providing them with any assessment reports, etc. by your doctor or other professionals indicating their concerns would be helpful.)

Below are several websites with information about autism spectrum disorders (including information about early identification) that you might find informative.  Again, I recommend that you contact your son’s pediatrician and school team to help answer your questions.

366,possible autism?,"
        I would recommend having your child assessed to see if he might meet the criteria for an autism-spectrum diagnosis. Essentially, these criteria involve deficits in social interaction and repetitive patterns of behavior. Diagnosis or no, it sounds like you’re doing the right things for him in terms of seeking services to address his needs. Every child is different and a diagnosis might help you attain services but those services need to be focused on what will help him the most. Another benefit is that it might help with putting you in touch with other families that have children like your son. Those parent support groups can be a great source of comfort and advice. It sounds like some of your main concerns involve your son’s ability to handle transitions and his social interaction. Those are things that can be directly addressed, and I suggest you seek out a behavior analyst or therapist who has experience working with children like your son. Your son isn’t the only one with these challenges and there are professionals out there who can help him work on and further develop those skills.

367,SPD kindergartner-could he be enjoying these tantrums?,"
        The type of tantrums you describe are not entirely uncommon in children diagnosed with autism-spectrum disorders and they are seen in children who are typically developing as well. It sounds like you have an effective approach, in that your son eventually comes around and gets back on track, and the consistency that you mention is key.  The type of emotional blow outs that you are describing typically happen when something desired is withheld or when a child is required to engage in an activity and the regular “I don’t want to do it” repertoire doesn’t work to get him or her out of it. All of us experience frustration of that sort but our young children haven’t learned how to handle it without the blow out yet. There is no evidence to support the notion that these tantrums are a qualitatively different experience for children like your son. He gets frustrated and it can snowball into a full-fledged tantrum. The next goal for you, now that you’ve got him eventually coming around and doing the work he needs to, is to work on his learning to handle this frustration better. For typically-developing kids, exposure to social contingencies can be enough to get rid of the large-scale tantrums. For kids with autism-spectrum disorders, we have to teach this control explicitly. A good place to start is to figure out ahead of time what situations you expect to be problematic and then arrange special reinforcers for your when your son comes out of the tantrum. Sort of an “Ok, your upset, but when you’re done and you complete this activity there’s something really special waiting.” Sometimes it can be good to start with simple tasks, or just require a small amount of work at first. It’s ideal if he can experience not-tantrumming and something great happening a number of times before you get to the hard tasks.

368,Is there such a thing as mild asperger's,"
        It certainly is. We continue to see the number of diagnoses increase as the disorder becomes more and more well known. Also consider the fact that diagnostic criteria were broadened, meaning that there is a bigger net being cast now than at previous times. I would expect that there are many elderly individuals who would have recieved autism-spectrum diagnoses if the publicity and criteria had been the same when they were young.

        It sounds like there are several issues and some of your primary concerns are your son’s tantrums, aggression, and toileting. You mentioned that he has not been given a diagnosis but I would recommend having him assessed. You already know what the challenges are for your son and intervention will involve specifically addressing those issues, but having your son assessed can be a step toward getting services that he needs. Autism is characterized by delays in social behavior and communication, so I am not sure that diagnosis will be appropriate for your son. However, I do know that all of the problems that you note can be addressed successfully. For the tantrums and aggression, I recommend you seek out a board-certified behavior analyst in your area who has experience working with children like your son. These problems can absolutely be effectively treated and the most important thing for you to do is to get appropriate services. In this case, that sounds like finding a behavior analyst that can help you come up with a working solution.

370,Not speak with anyone in school,"
        Given that your English is not your son’s native language (and not the primary language spoken at home), I think it would be a little premature to assume that there is an underlying neurological or psychological problem.  If you are living the United States, since he is over three years-old you may request an initial Core Evaluation to determine if there are any indications of special needs through your local school district.  Regardless of where you live, you might also want to check with your son’s pediatrician for his or her opinion on the matter.  Your description seems to indicate that except for the lack of communication with peers, your son’s behavior is otherwise pretty typical.  I recommend you stay in contact with your son’s teachers and doctor to make sure his development continues to progress.  Perhaps they might recommend additional “non-pressure” experiences (play groups, social groups, etc.) for your son with other English speaking children to help foster his English language skills.

374,language confusion?,"
        Based on this brief description is it impossible to say what is going on with your son.  Sometimes there are functional reasons for repeating a question (e.g., people often do this when they don’t understand something and might be trying to make sure they heard correctly, as a way to get the speaker to elaborate, or just a kind of placeholder while they try to formulate an answer).  I recommend that you refer him to your local school district for a Core Evaluation to determine if there are any indications of special needs with his communication.  You also should check with your son’s pediatrician for his or her opinion on the whether there is a need for further assessment.  They will, of course, keep in mind that if English is not your son’s native language (and not the primary language spoken at home), there may be some delays or atypical patterns of speech.  I strongly recommend that you do speak with at least one of the professionals mentioned and not wait (there is nothing to be gained by seeing if “he will just outgrow” the behavior).  

Also, below is the website for the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (a National Institutes of Health agency).  There is a lot of great information about typical language development and some of the signs that should concern a parent that their child is not developing typical language.

375,Worried,"
        I know that you must be very concerned and frustrated with not being able to find a definitive answer to your son’s behavior.  Here are few questions to ask yourself and some suggestions I hope you will find helpful.  Other parents have told me they have found it helpful to do their best to stay focused on getting their child what he or she needs now and trying not to worry about the future.  Since you have already taken your son to the pediatrician where you now live and they have expressed concern, have they referred you to a local Early Intervention Program (EIP) for further assessment and treatment?  You mentioned that your son is already being seen by a speech therapist and an occupational therapist.  Are they part of the EIP team?  Note: If you have not been referred to an EIP, contact your son’s doctor at once.  This should certainly take place independent of any additional assessments you might pursue.  When parents have concerns that their child may have an autism spectrum disorder, I recommend that they try to find a clinic that specializes in children with ASDs for further assessment.  Talking to your son’s doctor or the local EIP may help with this.  

Recently I posted a reply to a somewhat similar question (i.e., delayed speech) and I found a website (below) at the National Institutes of Health that has a section on typical speech and language development.  It includes checklists that help you determine if your child is “on track” with communication development.  

http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/speechandlanguage.html#mychild

Some of the other other behaviors that would be indicative of the early signs of an ASD that you mentioned include the “ignoring” and “sensory issues.”  It may turn out that your child has a specific kind of speech delay; on the other hand, I believe it is important to monitor any child who appears delayed in achieving any developmental milestone.  I strongly encourage you to follow up first with your son’s pediatrician.  Below are several websites with information about autism spectrum disorders.  You may find it helpful to review these sites to see if you think you need to take your son in for further assessment for an ASD.

377,why my child age 3yr is spitting at others,"
        Many problem behaviors in young children are learned behaviors.  There are several different possibilities as to why a 3-year-old may learn to spit-- for example, she may do it because she has learned that spitting gets attention form adults or other children.  It is also possible that she may do it to avoid doing things she doesn't like.  For example, at dinner you might ask her to eat her vegetables, but if she spits at you, you might then tell her that she doesn't have to eat them.  If something like this happened, she might learn that spitting gets her out of doing things she doesn't want to do.  Finally, it's possible that she enjoys the physical stimulation of spitting and then cleaning it up.

It's not possible for me to know why she may be doing this, but there are several things you should think about so you can try to figure out why she is doing it. First, ask yourself when she is doing it.  Is she more likely to get it when she is getting attention, or not getting attention.  when she spits, is she doing something she likes doing, is she doing something she doesn't like doing, or does she spit when she is not doing other things?  Most importantly, what do YOU do when she spits?  Do you give her attention by telling her not to spit?  Do you ignore her?  Do you give her a toy to play with?  What you do will give you some clues as to why she might be doing this.  For example, you if give her attention when she spits, give her attention when she is NOT spitting, and try to ignore the spitting.  If she gets out of doing things she doesn't like to do when she spits, son't let her, but teach her to ask appropriately to end that activity.  problem behavior such as spitting serve a function--you just need to try to figure out what it is, (attention, avoidance of nonprefered activities, access to stimulation), and provide those things before she starts spitting.

Best of luck.in the future!

        The only way to determine if your son has any diagnosis is to take him to the properly qualified personnel.  Given the behaviors you describe and the fact that the nursery school teacher has raised some concerns, I believe you should definitely see your son’s pediatrician as soon as possible.  Explain your concerns to him or her and ask for a referral for a developmental assessment.  Hopefully, your son’s doctor will agree that further assessment is necessary.  I recommend that you ask the pediatrician for help in finding an assessment team familiar with young children and autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  In the meantime, below are several websites with information about autism spectrum disorders (some specific to early identification).  You may find it helpful to review these sites and see if the information seems to “fit” your son’s behavior.

        I am not sure I will be of much help, but I thought I would just mention that if you are quite sure that your son is not engaging in any of the other behaviors that would be indicative of an autism spectrum disorder, then I agree with you that this is an unusual behavior, but perhaps harmless.  I was particularly struck by your comment that he appears to understand that it is not appropriate to do this is front of peers and teachers.  At your son’s age, peer relationships and the complexities of the social environment that surround them become increasingly important.  If other children make fun of him for this behavior, you may wish to ask for advice from his school guidance personnel or a trusted teacher.  Otherwise, you may wish to consult with a behavior analyst about ways to teacher your son more socially acceptable behavior than the overt hand flapping (for both when he sees something he likes or needs to calm down).  Every parent is bound to be worried about anything that is “different” about their child.  If the behavior in question does not interfere with your son’s life in any way, perhaps it is not worth worrying about.  One final comment: if you notice that the behavior occurs more frequently in your presence (or under any particular set of circumstances) that would be worth exploring with a behavior analyst.  You provided a couple of examples that seemed quite disparate; for example looking at a specific event (i.e., the water surface patterns), but also that he needs this to “chill out.”  Among other factors, you would want to make sure that there are no social consequences that might be maintaining the behavior (e.g., attention from you or others when your son flaps).

This doesn’t sound like an autism specific issue and nothing in what you’re describing jumps out as autism to me. In young children, it is often difficult to tell if speech delays might be a function of hearing impairment and it sounds like you aren’t sure to what degree her hearing is actually impaired. I’d recommend starting there and seeking further hearing testing for her, seeking medical professionals that can provide information about the CP, and continue the speech therapy.

        While dyspraxia may occur in conjunction with an ASD, dyspraxia itself is not an autism-spectrum disorder and I highly recommend you seek out a specialist in dyspraxia and childhood sexual behavior right away. Individuals with autism may display inappropriate sexual behavior but this isn't a specific characteristic of the disorder but rather typically a delay in learning what is and is not appropriate. In the case of your son, it sounds like you are taking a reasonable approach in making sure he is not alone with other children and looking for a specialist to help. This is obviously a serious issue and one that requires immediate attention.

        I can’t speak to the preferences of the caseworker or any legalities involved but I have seen numerous situations where children with autism are sleeping in bed with their parents. Typically, however this isn’t an ideal situation and leads to problems down the road even if it’s working alright at the moment. Being able to be comfortable sleeping in a room by yourself is something that everyone has to learn. It’s important for later life and important to allow privacy for both children and parents. It would be a good idea to start now so that it doesn’t become a big issue later. I have worked with many parents who struggle with older children who become disruptive or aggressive if they are not allowed to sleep in bed with parents and, at that point, it’s something that can be very difficult to deal with. I understand your desire to keep things stable for your sons and to provide them with support but they also need to grow and develop and become independent. Now might be a good time to go ahead and get them sleeping in their own beds, in my experience getting them comfortable with that now will be a good thing.

385,Does my son have autism?,"
        Last week I asked a parent the same first question I frequently ask: what have been the pediatrician’s thoughts about your son’s development?  Pediatricians are often the first point of contact when any developmental problem is raised.  If you are in the United States, your son’s pediatrician would have referred you to a local Early Intervention Program for further assessment.  (But since you used the word “fortnight” so I’m thinking maybe a British background?).  In the US, as soon as a child with a suspected developmental disability turns three years of age, it is the responsibility of the local educational authority (usually your local city or town school) to do an educational assessment to determine if the child qualifies for special education services at that time.  You should check with your local government social services and educational agencies for the procedures where you live.  

Some of the behaviors you are describing may be the early signs of an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but they may also be an example of the phenomenon that most professionals often describe as “the wide range of development with children”.  While there is certainly truth to this, it is very important to monitor any child who appears delayed in achieving a developmental milestone or whose behavior is atypical.  Your son sounds like he is developing typically in many areas, but that there are some areas of concern.  I strongly encourage you to follow up first with your son’s pediatrician.  

Below are several websites with information about autism spectrum disorders.  You may find it helpful to review these sites to see if you think you need to take your son in for further assessment.

        Although you did not mention this, based on your description of your son’s behavior, I hope that your regional early intervention program (EIP) and the local education authority (LEA; your town or city school district that you live in) are involved and providing at least some services to help you.  Since you do mention that your son’s pediatrician has only recently noticed some of the behaviors you describe, however, I am guessing that she has not made any referrals to the agencies I mentioned (and now that your son is over three, he would no longer be eligible for EIP services).  With regard to a diagnosis, I suggest you talk with the pediatrician and ask to have your son referred for further assessment.  If upon further assessment, the assessors feel that your son may have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), then I recommend that you take him to a clinic that specializes in children with ASDs for further assessment.  Since your son is already over three years of age, the LEA is responsible for performing a CORE assessment if you request one.  Contact your local department of education for information on how to initiate this process.  (Note: providing them with any assessment reports, etc. by your doctor or other professionals indicating their concerns would be helpful.)

In the meantime, independent of your son’s diagnosis, it sounds like there are a number of problem behaviors that you could use some help in managing.  I suggest that you ask the pediatrician for a referral to a Board Certified Behavior Analyst to help you with the problem.  You can go to the Behavior Analyst Certification Board’s website (http://www.bacb.com/) to see if there is one near where you live; or at least to see what types of qualifications you should be looking for in someone to help you.

390,attacked by an autistic student,"
        Every child should in the least restrictive placement possible, but everyone needs to remember that the phrase that is attached to the “least restrictive placement” is: that is therapeutically effective.  You refer to “…increasingly violent…” behavior, which indicates that the student is not improving.  Important factors include whether the incidents are increasing in intensity, frequency, and/or duration.  For any program to be effective, it is critical that everyone participating be safe.  A mainstream placement will not be successful if that basic need is not met.  Have you discussed the matter with whoever is responsible for the student’s behavior management program, the team chairperson, and/or the principal of the school?  It sounds like you may need to reconvene a team meeting to discuss the treatment programs and protocols for the student you refer to.  At a minimum, if the student cannot be restrained (and there may be legitimate reasons that is the case), then at the very least, the team is responsible for determining what steps are to be taken to protect everyone involved (including the student) during a violent incident.  Finally, sometimes it is necessary to bring in a behavioral consultant to reviewed the current program and suggest modifications.  I would also remind everyone involved that the best procedures for working with violent students are obviously the ones that preclude the violent behavior.

391,Autistic child sleeping too much?,"
        Based on your description, I suggest you at least call (or visit) your daughter’s pediatrician and discuss the matter with him or her.  Sleeping more than she used to, but still having dark circles under her eyes sounds counter to what one would expect.  A few questions that you may expect to be asked: How “much more than usual” is she sleeping?  Is she sleeping at different times than she used to?  You may want to start a chart monitoring her sleep patterns.  How many more “meltdowns” than previously?  Again, some measurement to compare before she was ill to the present would be helpful.  If you weren’t collecting that information previously, then start now (at least you may be able to see what’s increasing or decreasing from now on).    
Finally, are you receiving any help with training or behavioral- based therapy at you home?  If so, you may wish to discuss with the person supervising the program the recent changes.  Perhaps they might have some suggestions for getting your daughter “back on track” for sleeping.  (Of course they would want you to consult with a pediatrician first to rule out any medical/physical causes.)

        If that is the only thing he or she is saying, I think you should be concerned.  What have been your child’s pediatrician’s thoughts about your child’s development?  Pediatricians are often the first point of contact when any developmental problem is raised.  If you are in the United States, your child’s pediatrician can refer you to a local Early Intervention Program for further assessment. I have also provided a website (below) at the National Institutes of Health that has a section on typical speech and language development.  It includes checklists that help you determine if your child is “on track” with communication development.  Finally, one point most professionals will make is that there is a wide range of development with children.  While that is certainly true, it is very important to monitor any child who appears delayed in achieving a developmental milestone.  The earlier any problem is identified, the easier it is to identify an effective intervention to help.

        I feel your pain. My foster daughter just turned 14 and has Asperger's Syndrome as well as a rare condition called RAD (Reactive Attention Disorder). She is also very strong, and impossible to control. She's even beaten up boys that are way bigger than her, and she works out a lot. 

She is very violent, and even broke another girls' nose when she was 10, and her nose was even displaced so it doesn't look as it did before. 

We've tried getting her individual lessons for boxing, and it has helped her bit. but the problem is it gave her more skills to help her beat up other people. 

Now if you really think that Asperger's has something to do with it, you're wrong. He must have something else, because Asperger's doesn't make people THAT violent.

394,"Violent Aspergers, Please Help","
        First off jlevin, i think that one of the issues that needs to be further explored is WHY he doesn't want to take his medicine, is it because he thinks he doesnt need it or something?  Another thing is the question of what is triggering these violent outbursts? is it stress, someone making a comment about something, etc.

I'm talking from personal experience here by the way.  Usually with me the problem usually starts out small, like say my Dad wants me to empty the dishwasher, and I say ""no, I don't want to, and nothing's preventing you from doing it""  from there the issue would escalate to something like my Dad cutting off the internet, or attempting to take away my laptop.  The problems then build on themselves from there.  

Asperger's Syndrome alone does not cause these issues.  It's more a misunderstanding that's placed there due to the disorder.  Basically meaning, that like in the example of my dad asking me to empty the dishwasher, I'll interpret it as him being lazy and trying to delegate all his jobs off to other people (when he really already does quite a lot).

Also in some cases of people with Asperger's, removing them from a familiar area/situation,  and putting them into a new unknown place can cause more problems than it solves.  

I understand that you want to help their family out jlevin, but it seems that the actual problem is a lot more deep seated than initially thought.  There seem to be a couple solutions to this issue.  The first issue that needs resolving is that their family needs to regain a sense of security and control again.  The parents need to be put back in control of the situation is basically what i'm saying.  So now that i've said that...I'm about 50/50 on this solution, basically that the next time an outburst occurs that they need to call the police.  Now here's why im debating whether this will help or not.  The problem is that since he's over 18, the police can charge him with assault or domestic abuse or both.  This most likely would land him in jail, which in my mind would probably only serve to make things worse as he'd probably think it was his family's fault he got sent there.  So instead of making things better, it would make things worse.  Although there's the chance that it could turn him around for the better, I don't know.

Secondly, I'd say that their family should talk to his psychiatrist ASAP and bring up the issue of the violence, and see what the psychiatrist says and reccomends to be done.

Third, I'd probably say that in order to get to the actual core problem, their family should possibly think about a therapist.  Talk therapy can be very helpful as it would most likely be a chance for him to tell his side of the story as well as hear what the other perspective is.  

Hope this helps

397,I'm 18 and my four parents all strongly believe I have Aspergers,"
        Well ok, I'll do my best here to answer your questions.  First of all Diagnosis is usually done via psychological testing.  Scans of your brain won't tell you much, if you do have asperger's all a CAT scan will show is that your brain isn't working as it SHOULD be.

Treatment is usually done with medication, sometimes therapy, there's no one SINGULAR treatment for Asperger's as it's an autistic disorder.

Asperger's does not affect brain development, at least not by your age it doesn't.  Any developmental delays or problems usually occur during childhood, such as for example, your parents might notice you having trouble interacting with other kids your age, etc.

the hallmark of Asperger's is impaired social abilities.  As Sydmia said, this normally comes in the form of having difficulty reading body language, facial expressions, and other non-verbal cues.  Asperger's can also affect your motor coordination (i.e. clumsiness)(and believe me, it gets annoying at times).  EXTREME focus on a very narrow subject (such as trains or Hurricanes).  People with Asperger's like to develop routines, and have a hard time deviating from one.  Encountering a new situation can lead to fear, anxiety, etc.

there's a lot of information out there that can describe how people with Asperger's work and think internally,  If you're interested in literary help, then I'd suggest looking up Dr. Tony Attwood (considered by some to be the authority on Asperger's Syndrome)

I would say that you probably have SOME form of Autistic disorder, as you said that you've always been in your own world.

398,medication,"
        As children with autism spectrum disorders get older they often present new challenges for their caregivers.  First, let me say that there is no way that I can comment on any specific medication that might help with your son’s behavior.  I strongly recommend that you notify the team responsible for your son’s education and treatment about your concerns and ask to convene a team meeting as soon as possible.  It may be that they have resources that may help.  For example, perhaps they can provide (or direct you to an agency that has) behavior analysts that specialize in the kind of problems you are having with your some.  Often a great deal of progress can be made in addressing behavior problems without the use of medications.  If, however, the team feels that your son should be at least assessed regarding the use of a medication for his behavior, then I recommend that you check into your local resources (through your son’s physician or other local health agencies) about the possibility of having him seen by a psychopharmacologist.  Use of medication with children should be approached with caution and a team effort.  If anyone does prescribe any medication for your son, they should be familiar with children with ASD and working in conjunction with a team to determine the best course of action.

        Certainly some of the behaviors you are describing could possibly indicate your son is on the autism spectrum, but from your description I believe your school is taking the correct approach by first having him assessed by (I assume) a speech and language pathologist.  What have been your son’s pediatrician thoughts about your son’s development?  Pediatricians are often the first point of contact when any developmental problem is raised.  If you, your son’s doctor or the school do feel that your son may have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), then I recommend that you take him to a clinic that specializes in children with ASDs for further assessment.  Alternatively, since your son is already over three years of age, the local educational authority (typically your local school district) is responsible for performing a CORE assessment if you request one.  Contact your local department of education for information on how to initiate this process.  (Note: any assessment reports, etc. by your doctor or other professionals indicating their concerns would be helpful.)

It may be that your some is just an individual with his own preferences that are bit different that those of other children, but it is worth having him assessed to rule out other more serious problems.

I also have aspergers and it will kind of make it hard for him to make friends and as he gets older he might mature but he will usually have intrests that you will find different, I still watch cartoons and spend the majority of my time playing video games. But I can reassure you that aspergers, even though it is part of the austism spectrum, is very mild compared to austism but he will adapt and get better. The older you get the less obvious it is.

        If your local doctor felt your son had early signs of autism, then I strongly recommend you try to find a clinic that specializes in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) for further assessment.  I do not know what country you live in, but you should look for any government-supported services that may be available.  In the United States any child referred by a doctor due concerns about developmental disabilities will be see by the local early intervention program (EIP) in their area for little or no cost.  

The behaviors you are describing may be the early signs of ASD, particularly if your child’s pediatrician has ruled out other factors (e.g., hearing problems).  Below are several websites with information about autism spectrum disorders (both specific to early identification and infomration regarding the best treatment for ASDs).  You may find it helpful to review these sites to see if you think you need to take your son in for further assessment.  If you think that your son is on the spectrum, then it is important to get help as soon as possible.  Again, I would look to your local governmental agencies (medical, educational, child welfare) to see if there are any services you can take advantage of.

Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including Autism, Asperger’s, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests.  There is some variability in what is considered “typical” development, and it sounds as though your pediatrician was comfortable with his current level of development.  
It can be very confusing to get opposing opinions on your child’s diagnosis from different professionals.  Although I’d like to help, the only way to get an accurate diagnosis is through an in-person evaluation by a qualified professional.   Given the conflicting recommendations and feedback, I would recommend that you take a conservative and proactive approach: Avail yourself of any services that have been offered (e.g., speech therapy) without going overboard with additional assessment at this time.   Give him some time to respond to the therapy (at least a few months, I’d imagine) and then perhaps ask for a re-assessment.  If his speech development is later assessed to be typical, and he is not showing any other signs of delay, then you can rest easy.  If however, he continues to struggle, then you haven’t lost any time in getting him some help and might consider pursuing further services for him. 
Good luck to you and your family.

        raven, your son sounds just like a little boy in our church. His parents were frustrated over their child's pointing and non verbal ways, and of course, always comparing his behavior with other 3 year olds.  Their pediatrician referred him to a speech therapist and that was the best thing!  He has so improved in the communication department and is one of the most social and friendly 6 year olds I know.  It's like he was released from his prison.  

And as far as the school system suggesting autism, well, I will say that a non professional giving that kind of diagnosis possibility is out of line.  I work in Special Education in the school system and I can tell you now that saying such a thing to a parent could get someone in trouble and financially responsible for that child's care.  Whatever a school person might suggest, they had better have some resources to back up their claims!

        I have to agree from personal experience. Our son had limited vocabulary at age two but always had great eye contact, interpersonal skills. He did not play with his toys very much but showed interest in other children etc.

We had numerous assessments and many opinions. We settled on speech therapy which led to OT for some sensory issues that were driving the communication delays. Our son flourished in therapy from age 2 to age 5 when the therapist actually used him as the role model for the other children. 

We have a Neuro Typical diagnosis at this point and I do believe he probably was a late bloomer all along. I know the therapy was essential in helping him find his way through some communication difficulties and I couldn't be more proud of him!

        The diagnostic criteria for autism-spectrum disorders are behavioral and those behavioral patterns and deficits can arise from any of a number of underlying causes. Having a mitochondrial disorder like DG may increase the likelihood of receiving an autism diagnosis because the disabilities associated with DG may be sufficient for the individual to also meet the DSM criteria for an autism-spectrum disorder.

        Autism diagnoses are behavioral and a child may recieve one because of deficites arising from a number of different problems. There are two things for you to consider. What should you be doing for your son right now and why does he have these delays. Finding out the cause is often most important in case it would change the approach that you're taking in helping your son. As far as identifying a particular disorder, the best approach you can take is to continue to seek referrals to specialists who can make a proper diagnosis. In the mean time, for both Fragile X and Weaver syndrome, the best thing you can do is to make sure that your son is receiving services addressing his particular delays. There is no cure for either and children with these disorders can make substantial progress from early intervention. I also have to caution you away from the dietary approach to treating these disorders. They have been researched thoroughly and there is no reason to expect that they will help your son. The best thing that you can do is to be aggressively addressing his skill deficits and behavior problem through intensive behavioral intervention and teaching.

        Tantrums over sharing toys in 4 year-olds is a fairly common problem, so I don’t think you need to be concerned about autism or other diagnoses based on that type of behavior.  However, although it is fairly common, you still may want to be “concerned” in that you’d like for him to thrive at the nursery – you want the teachers to like working with him and for the other students to enjoy playing with him, etc. For that reason, you may want to look into some strategies that you can try out at home that help teaching sharing and waiting, and then help him carry those strategies over to other settings (practice at friends’ houses, etc., and enlist the help of the teachers are his nursery to use these strategies, as well).

        Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including autism, Aspergers, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests.  Based on your description, it doesn’t sound as though you have concerns with his social or language development; your concerns seem to be related to problematic behavior (tantrums).  Engaging in problematic behavior does not mean that your child will end up with a diagnosis of developmental delay or an Autism spectrum disorder– plenty of typically-developing infants and children engage in forms of problematic and stereotyped behavior.  Although an in-person evaluation is necessary to determine what (if any) diagnosis is appropriate, your description doesn’t suggest autism. 

Regardless of his diagnosis, childhood behavior problems like tantrums can typically be addressed through consultation with a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA).  If you feel that the behavior is stigmatizing or interfering with more adaptive behaviors, you may want to consult with a BCBA.  This professional will want to spend time directly observing your child as well as interviewing your family, so that they can provide recommendations on how to best address the issue. A local BCBA can be found at the following site: http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html

        The term for eating inedible objects is “pica” and the behavior analytic literature shows that a variety of interventions can be successful in reducing this behavior, regardless of a child’s diagnosis (whether it be autism or other developmental disabilities).  However, due to the complexity of many of these interventions and the potential severity of this behavior, I’d recommend that you provide close supervision for your daughter and consider getting some professional help.  The Behavior Analyst Certification Board maintains a registry and local search engine for Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs):  http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html

In the meanwhile, I’d maintain close supervision of her and make sure that her play area, bedroom, and any other room she can access is free of potentially dangerous items (batteries, nails/tacks, and really any items small enough to fit into her mouth).  After she is cleared to eat items by mouth, you might also consider providing continuous and free access to preferred food.  Until that time, try to keep her fairly engaged with highly preferred (and large and non-toxic) play items that hold her interest – this might help minimize attempts to put items in her mouth. Again, supervision and vigilant monitoring of her surroundings is the best way to keep her safe, even if you are trying some of the other recommendations above.

419,"I'm worried my 22 month old might be autistic, can I get an opinion from someone experienced?","
        Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including Autism, Asperger’s, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests.  Typically, a child around your son’s age would be just at the start of language acquisition (have a vocabulary of maybe 25-50 words, but potentially with poor articulation), so it is difficult to tell whether he really has significant language delays or whether his language will pick up in the coming months.  It’s also difficult to tell from a description whether he really meets the criteria of restricted behavior and interests – lots of typically-developing children have a fascination with certain sensations (noises, light-up or reflective materials, water play, etc.), so his interest in the vacuum cleaner isn’t necessarily abnormal.  Finally, tantrums and food selectivity are also pretty common issues with toddlers – not necessarily indicative of developmental problems. 

Remember that there is some variability in what is considered “typical” development.  An in-person assessment is required to say whether your son really meets any of these criteria, so bring your concerns to your pediatrician so that s/he can help you determine whether your son’s development is typical. Your pediatrician can then help you decide whether further evaluation is warranted.

420,Weird 18 month old changing behavior!,"
        There is a pretty good-sized range in what is considered typical development, and it’s not terribly uncommon to see some fluctuation in the performance of those skills.  So it could be perfectly normal that he is talking a bit less than he was a couple of months ago, especially if he isn’t really at the point where he is doing much talking at all. 

Autism Spectrum Disorders are diagnosed based on delays in language and social interaction skills and repetitive or stereotypical behaviors, and it doesn’t really sound as though he meets any of those criteria.   If you are genuinely concerned, however, you should bring your concerns to your pediatrician who can help you decide whether further evaluation is warranted.  An in-person evaluation is necessary for any real diagnosis, so bringing your concerns to your pediatrician might ease your mind (or get your son started with the help that he needs). 
Best of luck!

        The only way to know for sure if it's autism is to have him evaluated by a place that deals with development of children. I took my son to a CDRC-child development and rehabilitation center and they diagnosed him w/ autism. He didn't have all of the signs of autism either, because every autistic person is different and has different signs and symptoms. The best that you can do for your son is to find a place to evaluate him and then set up the supports to help him. He is the perfect age to start Early Intervention, they can help a lot with resources. Get him into a good special ed preschool if he is diagnosed, that has helped my son TREMENDOUSLY!!! Also we are filing for social security for him to help cover the costs of therapies-DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED IF HE HAS AUTISM, JUST GET CREATIVE!!! There is more support out there than you think...i'm slowly learning. :0)

423,Not talking,"
        
Most children will be doing a little bit of preliminary talking (around 40-50 words) by around 2 years of age, although their articulation may be poor and they may be difficult to understand.  I recommend that you express your concerns to your pediatrician, who can help you better determine whether a consultation with a speech and language pathologist is warranted.  Even if your son’s language skills are somewhat delayed, that doesn’t mean that he will not learn to speak – a speech and language pathologist and/or audiologist can  help determine what sorts of problems exist and what type of intervention might be helpful.

        I have a son with Asperger's.  My understanding is that ADD/ADHD sort of goes hand in hand with AS.  It is not an actual separate diagnosis, but is expected behavior for an Aspy kid.  You may consider a second opinion/treatment option.  If the doc is not listening to you and you are experiencing this degree of frustration, shop around.  I know it's difficult to find docs who are well-versed in autism spectrum disorders, but you have to trust your doctors.  

Have you pinned him down as to why he's so resistant to treat?  Is there something that would contraindicate treatment?  IF no, it may be time to look for another doc.

Possibly the behavioral therapist can communicate with the psychiatrist?

Good luck to you and your daughter.

        ABSOLUTELY get a second opinion!! My 8 year old son shows symptoms of both Aspergers and ADHD,and has been diagnosed with both, along with many other things by his previos doctors. We have seen a multitude of drs and specialists, and finally we have found one that is focused on the symptoms first and the diagnosis second. By treating him as an individual an focusing on his specific problems, rather than putting him in a box with a label on it, we are finally getting some results. Also, the right doctor will try to educate you as well as treat your child, because a kid can only make progress if we know how to help him make it. I hope this helps, I have been going through this for 7 years now and I know how frustrating it is.

        It isn’t uncommon for there to be disagreement on the appropriateness of an ASD diagnosis. The important thing here is knowing the areas in which your son is challenged and making sure that he has the services that he needs. The diagnosis is just a label based on his behavioral profile. The disorder doesn’t get treated, the behavioral deficits do. Push to get your son all the services that he would benefit from and don’t assume things will improve on their own. Whether or not he has an autism diagnosis is an issue that is secondary to ensuring that he is receiving needed services.

        There is no method for testing for this and there is some evidence that siblings of children with autism are also more likely to have autism. Because we don’t know the particular genetic or epigenetic factors responsible, it is just impossible to predict precisely ahead of time. The best advice that I can give you is to discuss it with your partner with the understanding that having a child with autism is a real possibility.

431,why do autistic children head bang?,"
        This is a complex issue and the answer is that it depends. We know that different children emit self injury for different reasons and, even for a given individual, self injury may have multiple causes. We also know that it happens for a reason and identifying the reason for the behavior underlies modern behavioral approaches to treating problem behavior and teaching functional, appropriate alternatives. In some cases the behavior may be self stimulatory and in other cases it may serve one or more communicative functions and there are empirical analyses that can identify why the behavior is occurring in a particular instance. This is particularly important because treatment for behavior that occurs for one reason will be ineffective, or at times make things worse, for behavior that occurs for a different reason. 

For example, two common reasons why self injury can occur are that it may produce attention from caregivers or it may get the child out of having to do tasks or activities that the child doesn’t want to do. If the behavior is the child’s way of getting attention, an effective treatment might involve teaching the child an appropriate means of getting attention and not attending to the problem behavior. However, if you were to apply that sort of intervention to behavior that is the child’s way of getting out of activities that he/she doesn’t want to do (i.e., not giving it attention), you’re also letting the child out of the activity. This ends up reinforcing the problem behavior, teaching the child that self injury is an effective way of escaping from undesired activities, and making the problem much worse. If you applied this intervention to self injury that was self stimulatory in nature, it would be ineffective but at least wouldn’t exacerbate the problem. So, there’s no single reason why self injury occurs and empirical analysis is the only way to be sure that an intervention is appropriate for a particular individual’s behavior.

432,could my daughter have aspergers,"
        Autism spectrum disorders have behavioral diagnostic criteria, so individuals can be diagnosed with autism due to deficits from a number of different causes. Because of this heterogeneity and the fact that the diagnostic criteria are behavioral, an ASD diagnosis doesn’t point the way to a treatment for the disorder. What it indicates is that the individual has certain delays that warrant intervention. Applied behavior analysis is the most effective and reliable method for addressing both her problem behavior and her skill deficits and the best recommendation that I can give you is to seek out a certified Behavior Analyst in your area who has experience working with children like your daughter. The prognosis for significant improvement is often quite good and the earlier you obtain behavioral services the better. 

The use of medication to treat behavioral problems is something that needs to be monitored very closely. It is impossible to tell ahead of time if a particular medication will produce a beneficial impact with a particular individual or not and this is always a process of trial and error. If you are going this route, make sure that you have a psychiatrist who works well with you and is responsive to your feedback about the effectiveness of the medication.

433,HELP!!! What is going on with my 3-year old??,"
        First of all, you are quite right to have concerns about your son’s behavior.  Speaking to your pediatrician was exactly the first thing I always recommend when parents have any question regarding their child’s development.  In your case, it sounds like it wasn’t all that helpful.  Although referring you to a psychologist wasn’t necessarily a bad option, it sounds as though referral for further diagnostic assessment may have been a better choice.  I recommend that you go back to your pediatrician and ask for a full development assessment by a team familiar young children and developmental disabilities, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).  Although you didn’t describe your son’s communication behavior, given that you said he is very smart, I assume he is verbal, and communicating at age level.  The other behaviors you describe might be indicative of a number of developmental problems and here again, a team evaluation would be helpful.  As far as methods to help your son behave more appropriately, I suggest that you may wish to ask the pediatrician for a referral to a Board Certified Behavior Analyst to help you with the problem.  (You can go to the Behavior Analyst Certification Board’s website (http://www.bacb.com/) to see if there is one near where you live; or at least to see what types of qualifications you should be looking for in someone to help you.)  As with the above recommendation regarding finding an assessment team with experience with young children with ASD, so should anyone you speak with to help you with your son’s behavior (based on your description of the behavior).  I have also provided a few web addresses of sites about the symptoms of ASD that you might find helpful in looking at aspects of your son’s behavior.

        The history you describe of your grandson’s medical problems is not at all typical of what most parents of children who are diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) describe of their child’s early development.  Based on the number and intrusiveness of the medical interventions for your grandson, I would hope that every appropriate genetic screening and associated medical test for possible disorders has been done.  I encourage you to speak with your son or daughter and ask if this be the case.  You may also wish to have your grandson assessed by a team familiar with young children and ASDs.  Talking with your grandson’s pediatrician is the best place to start that process.

437,Austic boy poops on floor but is otherwise potty trained,"
        Toilet training children can be challenging and even a minor developmental disability or delay may make the task that much more difficult.  Therefore I recommend that you obtain the services of a behavior analyst to develop a specific training program tailored to meet your son’s needs.  Does your son attend any educational setting (preschool, daycare, etc.)?  Perhaps there might be someone from his school team who could help or recommend someone.  A book I typically recommend to anyone toilet training any child is: Azrin, N., & Foxx, R. M. (1974) Toilet Training in Less Than a Day. Simon and Schuster, NY.  It is written for typically developing children, but the basics of the toilet training procedures apply to everyone.  The main reason for recommending a behavior analyst is that you may need to adapt the training procedures in the book and therefore would need help from someone with the proper experience and training.  In particular, in the Azrin and Foxx book there are detailed instructions for what to do when children have accidents, and how to use positive practice and restitution procedures to address the problem.  Balanced with the proper training and incentives for your son using the toilet, you may be able to correct the problem fairly quickly.  One thing that you could start on your own: taking data on the frequency of the wetting and soiling in inappropriate places, etc. Be sure to include that date and time.  Sometimes even though a pattern is initially not obvious, when it is written down and examined over the course of a week or two, a pattern emerges.  Again, a qualified behavior analyst would be on great help in determining this and creating a plan to address the behavior.  

Finally, everything above assumes that there is no medically-related condition that might interfere with your son using the toilet.  If you are unsure, I strongly recommend that you speak with your son’s pediatrician before attempting any toilet training procedures.  

I encourage you to look into the information above and not get discouraged.  With the proper help I am sure you can turn this around.

438,worried need insight,"
        Much of what you describe is within the range of typically developing children, but there are a couple of milestones that may be delayed.  My initial answer to questions like yours is always the same: take your son to your pediatrician and discuss your concerns with him or her.  If your son’s doctor believes further assessment is necessary, then I recommend that you ask the pediatrician for help in finding an assessment team familiar with young children and autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  Alternatively, the pediatrician may suggest that you wait until your son’s next check up to see how he is doing, or refer you to a local Early Intervention Program (EIP) for screening.  I also always mention that if the recommendation is to wait, I strongly recommend that if you notice any decrease in the course of your son’s development you contact the pediatrician at that time (and not wait).

As I mentioned in your description of your son’s behavior there are a number of things that may or may not be indicative of some problem, but there is a range in the development of children such that at 16 months of age diagnosis may be difficult.  It sounds as though your son is socially engaged, and doesn’t have unusual stereotypic behavior.  It is possible that his expressive communication is somewhat delayed and warrants further attention.  Continuing to keep him in a stimulating social environment, encouraging him to communicate his needs in an appropriate manner, and monitoring his progress seems like the best course of action at this time.

        The behavior you describe is certainly unusual in an otherwise typically developing child.  The first thing to do is follow your doctor’s recommendation for further assessment.  If there is no medical cause for the behavior then I suggest that you try to find a Board Certified Behavior Analyst to help you with the problem.  You can go to the Behavior Analyst Certification Board’s website (http://www.bacb.com/) to see if there is one where you live; or at least to see what types of qualifications you should be looking for in someone to help you.  It isn’t really possible to make a suggestion for any type of intervention without actually seeing your son and also asking more questions.  A behavior analyst will try and determine the function of the behavior rather than being so concerned about the form.  That is, examining the circumstances that surround the behavior and considering if there are consequences to the behavior that may be changed.  If your son is troubled by the behavior then he may be a candidate for some self-monitoring procedures that are often helpful in addressing behaviors like the one you describe.

441,very confused,"
        Autism and Asperger’s Disorders are characterized by a similar set of characteristics, most notably deficits in social interaction skills, communication skills, and highly stereotyped behaviors (e.g., repetitive motor or vocal behaviors that don’t seem to serve any function) or interests (topics of conversation or activity are highly restricted or narrow).  The major difference among the disorders is in language development: in Asperger’s Disorder, there is no delay in early language development. In Autism, there is some delay in language acquisition.  Also, delays (in language or social development) must be noted to occur prior to age 3 for a diagnosis of Autism.   

Unfortunately, it’s not possible to say whether a diagnosis is appropriate based on a description - direct evaluation by a qualified professional is necessary for any diagnosis.  It certainly sounds as though he may meet some of the criteria for an autism spectrum disorder.  If the doctors have recommended further evaluation, I would follow through on that.  Whether or not he ends up with an autism spectrum diagnosis, he might be able to benefit from services (of a speech and language pathologist, behavior analyst, etc.).

442,is it hallucination??,"
        It’s difficult to determine what is happening based on a description alone, but I’m not sure that I would describe these events as hallucinations.  This behavior could range from something innocuous and not harmful (perhaps he is relaxing and simply ignoring other events that are going on around him) to a serious medical event.  If you haven’t already, I recommend that you immediately contact your doctor and explain what has been happening – exactly what symptoms you are observing, when they occur, and whether you are able to interrupt these events (e.g., if you try to get his attention during this time, does he orient towards you?  Answer you?).   Some medications can cause serious side effects that may include muscle tremors or rigidity, so it’s important you bring this to the attention of your doctor soon (if you haven’t already).

If you have contacted your doctor and they have ruled out the possibility of medication side effects and other neurological or medical disorders, then you might start to look at ways to manage these behaviors.  Again, it’s difficult to tell precisely what is happening based on a description, but you this may be a way for him to relax, or it may be a form of stereotypy – repetitive, non-functional movements that are frequently seen in individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.  If this is the case, you might try first establishing when it’s okay to for this to happen (e.g., schedule down time for him in his bedroom for a while after school) and when he needs to be on-task, alert, etc. (e.g., while at school, or during family chore time on the weekend).  

If he is receiving special education services, you could ask the school if they have a Behavior Analyst on their staff who might be able to help you address his behavior. If these problems are occurring at school, it’s likely that the school is already trying to address them – hopefully, that person would be willing to work with you to help solve these problems.

443,Aggressive autistic children,"
        Unfortunately, without information as to why he is engaging in this aggressive behavior, it is difficult to determine how to effectively reduce the behavior. In addition, I’m reluctant to give you any specific advice about trying to change his behavior, as it’s not unusual for changes in programs to result in at least initial increases in behavior severity or frequency.   
If he is receiving special education services (in many states, special education services cover a young person until they are 22 years of age), you could ask the school if they have a Behavior Analyst on their staff who might be able to help you address his behavior. If these problems are occurring at school, it’s likely that the school is already trying to address them – hopefully, that person would be willing to work with you to help solve these problems. 
If the school is not providing help from a Behavior Analyst and you are interested in paying for and locating a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) in your area, the BACB website has a local service provider directory at:http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html.   If he receives support through Medicaid, some of that Medicaid funding can be allocated to the services of a BCBA – I’d recommend contacting your Medicaid caseworker to explain your needs and ask for help in the process.

        Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including Autism, Aspergers, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests.  It doesn’t necessarily sound as though your son meets these characteristics.  Typically, the language/communication delays exhibited are more extreme than the type of grammatical issues you noted.  Also, delays in social interaction skills usually manifest more dramatically than what you seem to have described, which sounds more like a shy or reserved child.  However, it’s really not possible to determine whether a diagnosis is appropriate just based on a conversation or description - direct evaluation by a qualified professional is necessary for any diagnosis.  If you haven’t already brought this to the attention of your pediatrician, I’d recommend doing so now. Be sure to discuss your specific concerns as well as developmental milestones that he is (or is not) meeting.  Your pediatrician should be able to help you decide whether your son would benefit from further assessment and evaluation.

        It’s tough to say why it’s happening, but it seems safest to first rule out any potential medical issues.  If you haven’t already, you should consult with her pediatrician and explain your concerns so that they can evaluate whether possible infections, constipation, or other illnesses are present. 
I presume that you are reporting this is a problem because she is toilet trained and has been continent for a long period.  If this is true, and you have ruled out medical causes, then you should start to look at the times and conditions under which this is happening?  Does it happen before or during activities that she doesn’t like (so she is essentially escaping those situations)?  Does it happen when you or other caregivers are distracted or unavailable (so that she gets attention)?   Once you have looked at some of the possible related factors, you might be able to better identify solutions to the problem.

        At this point, it sounds like just a speech delay. The interest in socializing is an excellent sign.

        Some of the parent comments here are really helpful! The most important thing at this point is to get services for your daughter. ABA and speach and language therapy can be extremely beneficial. On a side note, if you observe your child becomming resistant to ABA, I suggest discussing it directly with the therapist or seeking an alternative therapist. ABA isn't just mass trialing and one of the reasons that ABA is successful with kids diagnosed with ASDs is that it's an approach that relies upon creative use of an individual child's reinforcers (this is certainly not restricted to the use of edibles for everything) to keep the child motivated and engaged. If the child isn't interested in the activity or resistant, something is wrong with the programming.

        Sounds like my daughter who was diagnosed with pdd-now at age 3 and is now 6.  She didn't really talk until she was almost 4.  Some other symptoms were not responding to her name, she didn't really point to objects or pull us to go get things for her, she stared blankly at times.  She IS very affectionate and played with other children some.  The best advise I can give is to get her into ABA therapy and speech therapy asap.  
There are ways to get insurance to pay for these therapies even if you live in a state that doesn't require insurance companies to pay for therapy in Autism.
She's now talking, not like a normal 6yr old, she plays with other kids and is in a regular Kindergarten class.  If you were to just watch her you would think she is just really shy.  She has issues with aggression, depression, and gets over stimulated sometimes.  We have had to try some ADHD medications so she can stay focused in class.
I would also suggest reading some books on Autism.  Temple Grandin has written several.  
The last thing: PRAY.  We are not strong enough alone.  It takes a lot of patience and love for your little girl and yourself.  Always remember you are not alone.

        Hi there,

I live in NJ too and have a 3-yr-old son diagnosed with ppd-nos since he was 2. Do you have an IEP? If your daughter is social and interactive enough at school, she could get her 1-1 ABA therapy in the afternoons at home so you can observe and learn what to do too. The school should pay for it. Especially since you have a formal diagnosis you should be able to fight for it. Also, once your daughter reaches the age of 4, it becomes easier to find a social skills group. They can be very effective and you can get the school to include it in the IEP as well.

My son just started regular pre-K with 1-1 aide, speech and OT. No more ABA since he ""graduated"" from early intervention. I don't think he could benefit from it much anymore anyway. My son has started to realize the existence of social norms so he tries to comply some times with more success than others. I did not believe it when his early intervention therapists told me but other kids can have a powerful influence on our little ones on the spectrum.

Hang in there. There will be better days.

        My son's school has a dedicated ABA class. I guess if I wanted I could put my son there (at least for part of the day) to continue with ABA training. The school also provides ABA therapy at home in the afternoons to children who need it and qualify for it. However my son had grown extremely resistant to ABA. He became so oppositional that he started crying and tantruming every time a therapist would walk through the door. I guess he was ready to move on to something different. 

He hardly ever says anything at school. He will usually answer simple questions very briefly when he has to but otherwise he never takes the initiative to speak. Recently (last couple of months) he started to briefly comment socially and spontaneously about things that he sees around him but he only does that with me. Hopefully he will start doing that with others at school. For the rest, he understands what people tell him and follows instructions as well as the classroom routine.

We had his speech tested by a bunch of specialists and although his receptive and expressive language seem age appropriate his pragmatic speech is behind. In other words, he probably has not figured out why people like to talk to each other and how to do it. This is why neurotypical kids can have a great influence because they become role models. We also started following the Floortime approach at home and we are trying to incorporate the same principles in the school environment as well. He seems to be more receptive to it at this point.

Does your daughter seem to understand (even if she doesn't speak)? Can she follow instructions? If she understands language and can follow instructions I am not sure what continued benefit ABA can provide. Intensive speech therapy, social skills groups and constant modeling may be what she needs more.

What does her doctor say and the school say about your daughter? How does she do in the classroom?

        yes she can follow some simple instructions but not all. only those that she routinely do.

what school does your son go to? does he go to a private school? it seems nice in there. i mentioned to them that her neurologist wanted ABA for her but they decided that she needs OT and ST.dont know if we can demand for an ABA.

the teacher says she's doing good and she's participating in their activities but she tantrums sometimes..

she does not respond to her name right away.i have to call her a lot of times and sometimes  go in front of her and have to hold her so she can look at me.

        My son goes to public school in Hudson County. We are new to the school but the child study team and therapists seem quite dedicated. 

ST and OT in special-ed seems to be the default answer of many public schools to children with nearly any diagnosis. If your daughter's school does not have the resources to provide ABA you have every right to request for her to transfer to a different district (especially since you have a neurologist prescribing the treatment). Find the school you like that is closest to you and initiate due process with the district to have your daughter's case addressed. You can do this yourself but it may take a lot of time and effort. Hiring a parent advocate (you can even search online for one) is a good way to reduce the burden on you and is much less expensive than an attorney. A parent advocate can also give you advice and information on your rights and options.

Before you go down that path though, have you talked with your daughter's child study team? What justification do they give you for your daughter's current placement? You can call an IEP meeting at any time to voice your concerns and discuss with all education professionals responsible for your child. 

On a side note, based on what you describe, your daughter seems to be on a good trajectory. It sounds like she is starting to engage socially even if it is often difficult. Tantruming is pretty natural when speech is delayed. We experienced the same with our son. As soon as he realized though that he could ask for what he wanted the tantrums stopped. That was also the point when ABA stopped working for him.

The DIR/Floortime approach was created by Stanley Greenspan. ""Enganging Autim"" is one of his books and explains it well. It is geared towards building relationships rather than teaching skills which is achieved through ABA. In short, instead of demanding the child to complete a task you let the child do what he/she wants and then get involved in the same activity together in an effort to initiate reciprocal interaction. 

There is a lot of debate out there about which method is right but I think both have a place in the lives of children on the spectrum. I think withdrawn children need ABA to build basic skills to start interacting and once they start engaging with the world around them Floortime starts to be more effective.

Whatever you do though, please don't give up hope. Our children have the capacity to engange with the world around them in a profound way, they just need to be shown how. Keep challenging your daughter and keep asking for a little more every day. Eventually you will look back and you will be amazed by the progress. Most of all, try to enjoy her. The more giggles the happier and healthier everyone is.

458,kids chelate,"
        Chelation therapy is a treatment to remove heavy metals from the body. The use of chelation stemmed from the misconception that mercury poisoning from vaccines was causing autism. This has since been proven to be incorrect in multiple studies conducted in multiple countries. The use of chelation as treatment for autism has no scientific support whatsoever. What makes it worse than some other fad treatments is that it can actually be dangerous and many consider it to be unethical. This is a treatment that I am unable to support and one that the scientific and clinical community would suggest should be avoided.

        The types of behaviors that you describe your granddaughter engaging in are not entirely uncommon in typically developing children. If there are concerns about her communication, social interaction, or repetitive patterns of behavior, I would recommend going ahead and having her assessed for autism spectrum disorders. In the absence of those, you’ve got a typical little girl who may have might be classified as a habit disorder. These are extremely common and often go away on their own. If you find the mouthing to linger, I suggest the parents seek out a behavior analyst with experience treating habit disorders. There isn’t a vitamin or pill that you can take to solve the problem but behavioral methods are very successful in treating these.

Applied behavior analysis provides the most effective intervention for the types of tantrums and self-injurious behavior that you describe. My recommendation is that you seek out a board certified behavior analyst in your area that has experience treating behavior problems similar to the ones your son presents. These behaviors can be effectively treated and, based on how you describe your son, I would predict that he might respond quite rapidly to systematic behavioral treatment.

        Unfortunately there's no way of getting any sort of a good estimate right now. Even within the United States alone, the increasing estimates of the prevalence of autism stem largely from increases in what is being reported from areas in which the amount of testing has increased the most dramatically. Until testing methods are more standardized and there are known proportions of populations being tested, it’s very difficult to produce meaningful estimates of the sort you are asking about.

However, whether you have that particular diagnosis or not, it sounds like you have a good understanding of the areas that you feel like you would want to improve. Everyone has behavior patterns that they’d like to change regardless of whether or not they have been diagnosed with something. The most important thing to do is to address these issues head on. All of the concerns with social skills that you have can be improved. The most important thing is to find a psychologist or behavioral therapist who is working with you on them. Be specific about the areas of your life that you’d like to see improvement in and take the time to work on those things. The diagnoses is much less important than making sure that you’re actively moving toward addressing the areas of your life that you’d like to see improvement.

The best that I can tell you is that the medication may help. The most important thing is to make sure that you have a psychiatrist that you work well with and who is responsive to your needs.

        My son is 22 now and during his school years he was diagnosed with ADD. I had him on medication starting at 2nd grade but by 4th I realized he was digging deep holes in his head,much like a drug addict would do. I was horrified. I brought him into his doctor who lowered his dosage but I really started watching my son after that. I made the decision to take him off the meds as they did not seem to be working. I took him to a huge array of specialists and no one seemed to have a definitive answer. I heard he was OCD, ADD, developmentally delayed,learning disabled you name it, they labeled him. Finally I just gave up and home-schooled him. He had many characteristics of ADD (no hyperactivity) but something was off.He was (is) very smart he just has huge social delays. He didn't seem to relate at all to other kids. The older he got the worst it was. When he was 17 and in juvenile detention, almost 18 and ready to be transferred to adult jail I found my answer. On my own I was surfing the web and discovered a disability called Aspergers Syndrome. OMG!!! This was my son . To the T almost a perfect match. I spoke to the jail doctor and after some time I had my official diagnosis.As I mentioned he is 22 now and still lives with me. Your son can lead a normal life with Aspergers. My son has some other issues but I know if I put him in his own apartment and simply had someone help with his bills and day to day cleaning and such he'd be fine.I've heard it said if you see one kid with autism you've seen ....one kid with autism. The symptoms are all pretty much the same but the behaviors they display are as different as any other child. My son is very intelligent as are most Aspie kids,but he simply cannot understand how his actions affect others. He comes off as a complete jerk most often. If your boy has not been officially diagnosed you need to do that right away. There are lots of support groups for you and for him. I have to say it's much easier to help at an earlier age. The school should have picked up on it but as you can tell from my story not even doctors pick up on everything. Schools are very busy and kids get lost in the shuffle often. Props to your daughter for picking up on it. How old is she? I realize my post is a bit rambling but I thought it might help to see I've been through much the same thing. Does your son make friends? You mentioned bullying. Poor guy. Kids can be so mean. They sense a difference and go for blood. Again, check with your doctor. Push the issue. Bring up Aspergers yourself. Please Google Aspergers Symdrome. It will give you a complete lists of common symptoms. I was floored when I saw my son had 11 out of the 12 given.

        I recommend continued assessment in this case. Elements of what you describe fit the criteria for Asperger’s disorder and there are frequently cases in which psychiatrists will disagree on the appropriateness of the diagnosis.

Find a professional that works well with you and your son and who will be able to evaluate his need for support and help. It sounds like the current situation isn’t ideal, so, even if a diagnosis isn’t made, I absolutely recommend finding behavioral and mental health professionals to work with him.

        It seems your son is similar to me in some ways.  I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome when I was 11 and I'm also 21.  I only have 2 friends myself, not including internet friends.  And I've always had problems with projects, school/work related issues and working to achieve goals, etc.  I also have often wanted to wander off by myself when I don't feel like being around other people, even family  (so I spend most of my time in my bedroom).  And not being talkative is something I would have a problem with too.  Half the time, I make no attempt to hold a conversation with anyone, unless it's about something I'm interested in.  As for the paranoid delusions you mentioned, if it's something like hearing voices, that would be another issue that I could relate to.  But in all honesty, I wouldn't pin all your judgement on the opinion of one psychologist.  I've had one or two psychologists talk to me and they never understood me at all.  I would try and get a second opinion if I were you, maybe from a doctor who knows much more about Asperger's Syndrome, just to be sure.  If it turns out that your son does have Asperger's Syndrome, it's really nothing to worry about.  Although I myself never had any qualifications in school, I do some things that are good.  I've been able to read well since the age of 3 and write good poems and stories since I was 8.  My dream was to be an author, like Roald Dahl and JK Rowling, who are only some of my role-models.  It took a long time, but even without help or qualifications, I've had my very first children's book published and put online for sale in February 2010, which means I've achieved my dream.  Hopefully this will inspire others with Asperger's Syndrome to achieve their dreams and show them that it really is possible.  Anyway, good luck with you and your son and I hope you find all the answers you're looking for.  =o)

        The diagnostic criteria for autism include delays in communication and social interaction skills, and restricted or repetitive behavior.  In addition, these patterns of behavior need to be observed quite early to qualify for an autism diagnosis.  Other autism spectrum disorders (Asperger's, Pervasive Developmental Disorders, NOS, etc.) are diagnosed based on similar characteristics.

Based on your description, it's tough to tell whether he actually meets any of these criteria - your description of his development in these areas doesn't really seem that extreme.  Also, remember that there can be quite a bit of variation in what is considered typical development. However, only a professional (a pediatrician, psychologist, etc.) doing an in-person evaluation can determine whether a diagnosis of developmental disabilities is warranted.  I would recommend that you take him to the pediatrician and explain your concerns, and s/he can help decide whether referral to a specialist is warranted.   This way you can either rest easier knowing that someone has ruled out a diagnosis, or you can get your son started with some intervention.

Best of luck to you

479,Is my 5 yr old mildly autustic?,"
        My 4 year old son was diagnosed with pddnos which is on the Autism Spectrum... He also only loved playing with cars but he would do a lot of mimickink ( forgive my spelling) things he would hear on TV even though it was in the right timing. We were concerned because his speech seemed delayed but we could understand what he was trying to say. We had him evaluated by a group and we are here in Texas. It is called ECI- Early Child Intervention. He was then diagnosed and we started him in a program at our local elementary school and has been in it ever since. I am hoping that your kido does not have any of these issues but please know if he does there is help and my son has made huge improvements and the goal is for him to be integrated into a regular Kindergarten class and be out of special needs. Good Luck but I would get him checked out if you have any concerns!

        I'm guessing that you have already tried presenting portions of highly preferred foods and drinks, but if not, I'd go ahead and offer those - even if they are usually restricted as ""special treats"" (if your doctor has okay'ed ice cream, yogurt, carbonated drinks, etc.).  Be gently persistent in encouraging these, even if he continues to refuse.  You might also try offering a preferred toy or video contingent on taking just a small amount (e.g., a spoonful).  If you can get him to take a very small amount and earn the toy, you might be able to re-present a bit later and try for a larger amount.

Obviously, if too much time passes and he has continued to refuse even fluids, I'd be sure to let your doctor know and ask for further guidance.

481,What to do with daughter,"
        Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed based on delays in language and social interaction skills, and the presence of restricted interests or stereotyped patterns of behavior.  Based on your description, it doesn't sound as though she meets these characteristics.  Further, it also sounds as though she has been diagnosed with other disabilities.  However, only an in-person evaluation by a professional can rule in or out a diagnosis, so I would bring up your concerns with your pediatrician during your next appointment. 
It sounds as though the real issue is the problematic behavior she has been displaying (problem behavior such as aggression, stereotypy, etc. are common in the developmentally-disabled population as a whole, and is not restricted to individuals with autism). You may want to bring these behaviors to the attention of your pediatrician as well, and see what services are available.  A Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) can help you consistetly address and reduce these behaviors.  The BCBA website (www.bacb.com/consume_frame.html) can help you search for a local provider.

483,"repetitive behavior w facial tic, is it a stim?","
        Unfortunately, just watching a clip of a behavior won't reveal whether its a motor tic disorder or stereotypy (""stimming"") - the two can look identical under some circumstances.  It sounds as though you have been very proactive in getting some assessments scheduled/completed, and that is the best thing you can do about the situation.  
Although repetitive and stereotyped behaviors are one of the diagnostic criteria for autism, those types of behaviors aren't restricted to just developmentally disabled populations - it's not uncommon for typically developing children to engage in stereotypy.  Although it is best to rule out neurological disorders, etc., the fact that he engages in those behaviors don't mean for certain that he has a neurological or developmental disorder.  So if other doctors (especially the developmental pediatrician) have indicated that no further testing is necessary, you may want to consider just continuing the relevant therapies (speech, etc.) for a while and watching to see whether the facial movements improve or not.  On the other hand, if you strongly believe that you are seeing other indicators of autism (delays in social development coupled with delays in delays in language), you may want to ask your doctor to see another developmental pediatrician or psychologist.

        Based on what you describe, your stepson’s behavior can absolutely be dangerous. If he is emitting the intensity of aggression that you describe, he should be monitored closely around other children to make sure that he doesn’t hurt one of them. I would recommend beginning your stepson in the process of assessment to identify any medical issues and to get him on track to receiving early intervention if appropriate. The behavior you describe is treatable but can be quite dangerous for other small children. This should be addressed directly right away. I highly recommend that you seek out a behavior analyst in your area with experience working with children like your stepson.

Find a psychologist or behavior therapist with experience working with children like your son. The most effective interventions for behavior of the sort you describe involve setting clear contingencies in which your son earns some of his most preferred activities for having good behavior. Set some of those favorite activities aside as things that he only gets for being good. If he doesn’t earn them on a given day, that’s ok, there’s always tomorrow. Make a big deal out of success but avoid a big production for failure. Clarity and consistency are key!

490,"Should I get my son checked for Asperger""s Syndrome?","
        I’m not seeing the ASD hallmarks of social or communicative delays and preservative behavior in your description. So, while it’s something to discuss with the psychologist that he’s seeing, I’m not sure that that should be a primary concern of yours. The good news is that types of problem behavior that your son is presenting can be addressed. You’re on the right path with trying different psychologists or behavior therapists. Unfortunately, the range in orientation and approach taken ranges widely across psychologists, so it very well might take trying out several before you find one who gets you on a successful path. A typical approach in the situation you’re describing involves contingency management. This entails identifying some of your son’s favorite activities and making them contingent upon good behavior. These might be video games, television, movies, computer, etc… The contingency should be well delineated ahead of time and explained to him. For example, perhaps he gets an hour or two during the evening for playing video games or being on the computer but he only has access to video games and the computer during this time and only if he didn’t have any problem behavior previously during the day. Set up the rule, write it down, and stick to it. There’s no negotiating, no getting around it, and this takes the personal nature of him “disobeying” you out of it. He either meets the contingency or he doesn’t. It’s cut and dry. If he meets the contingency on a given day, great! If he doesn’t, that’s a shame but he can try again tomorrow. Don’t make a bigger deal out of it, don’t get into arguments over it, and don’t give him a ton of attention for problem behavior. Setting clear guidelines and following through with contingencies of this sort can absolutely work for the types of problems you describe.

491,why does my son wet him self at 10 years old,"
        What follows is an answer I recently provided for another question that I believe is also applicable in this case. Many children have problem with day-time enuresis. The issue is often the case that they really aren’t aware of their need to use the toilet, so this is no indication at all of your son being lazy. It’s something that he needs help with so that he’s better able to recognize when he has to go. Here is the answer I provided previously:

Whether your son has autism or not, this problem is entirely treatable. It is often sufficient to arrange a relatively simple differential reinforcement procedure for this. Identify some of your son’s favorite activities and set them aside for him to earn for keeping “clean pants.” You’ll want to start by rewarding him for periods of time that he can handle easily. For example, if it’s a once-a-day sort of thing, perhaps a special treat can be earned at lunch for going the morning without soiling, a special treat at dinner for the afternoon, and one at bed for the evening. If he’s able to understand, make sure you explain the contingency to him. Also, it can be helpful to arrange, at first, regular intervals to check (e.g., every 15 minutes). This can help him become aware of what he’s doing and allows you to catch it relatively soon after he soils. If he’s having a very hard time, there are monitors that you can purchase for enuresis that will sound a little alarm if he becomes wet. Often these alone are enough to work for treatment as the child becomes aware of the sensations that precede soiling and is then able to avoid it.

495,hand flapping,"
        Given the description you’ve provided, I recommend having your son assessed by a professional with experience diagnosing individuals with autism. Pediatricians often have little experience making these diagnoses and are, in most cases, not the best person to be making them. The types of repetitive movements that you describe and toe walking are observed relatively frequently in children with autism diagnoses. A reason why the doctor may not have brought it up is that it sounds like your son is developing well socially and communicatively. Autism diagnoses require an impairment in these areas. 

While I recommend having your son assessed, I also recommend seeking treatment for the toe walking and hand flapping regardless of the diagnoses. Find a behavior analyst in your area who has treated behavior of this sort before. For children like your son who don’t have concomitant intellectual delays, these behaviors can be very effectively treated through habit reversal and the arrangement of contingencies to motivate him to attend to what he is doing and stop. You keyed in on the fact that he doesn’t even seem to be aware that he’s engaging in these behaviors. The interventions that are typically effective involve teaching him to notice (perhaps have him even collect some data for himself) and then to do something else when he finds himself doing it. On top of this, favorite games and activities are arranged if he can go for longer and longer periods without toe walking or hand flapping.  All-in-all, your son presents as a child for whom interventions of this sort should be very effective.

        I was much the same from the age of 7, although I wasn't diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome until I was 11 (and it was my teacher who first noticed that I was different).  I've never liked noisy surroundings and crowded areas, which would either frustrate me or make me really nervous (making me want to just go somewhere away from all the fuss) and often, I'd get so nervous that concentrating on people talking seems almost impossible.  I would also start biting my nails (to the point where they'd almost bleed) when I get into situations like that.  And I don't think I've ever been comfortable giving people eye contact.  But from what I've found out or been told about it, those are just some of the classic signs of Asperger's Syndrome.  The one thing about GPs it seems, a lot of the time they don't suggest such conditions unless a: it's highly obvious and/or causes somewhat violent behavioral problems, unexplained mood swings etc. or b: they prefer someone else to suggest the idea first (whether a teacher, parent, etc).  At least that's the way it is with many of the GPs I've ever met.  Possibly because some parents may be in denial or get angry at such suggestions.  So, a GP may notice, but may be worried about saying anything in case you react badly to it.  But that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't help you.  The best thing to do is to mention your concerns about it and see if they can work on making a diagnosis for your son's condition.  And if they simply try to dismiss the suggestion, you can either go and get a second opinion or just keep insisting that they help you and your son (and don't take no for an answer).  Sometimes you have to get pushy to get the help you need.  Anyway, good luck for you and your son and I hope you get the help you're looking for.  =o)

502,smearing poop,"
        I’m not clear on whether your daughter has an autism diagnosis, but fecal smearing occurs with both typically developing children and those with autism. This is also something that can be effectively treated. In my experience this is much easier to treat using positive reinforcement than using punishment or guilt. I would recommend sitting down with her and coming up with a plan. Make sure that she understands that you’re on her side, that this is something that it isn’t ok to be doing and that you want to work with her on it. Children do many things that they know are “wrong” or that people might think are “disgusting” even when they know they shouldn’t and they often don’t entirely understand why they’re doing it. 

Rather than using punishment, I suggest arranging special reinforcement for her if she doesn’t touch her feces or do any smearing. Perhaps a special treat after school or some activity that she would really love, watching a movie, spending time on the computer, whatever. If there is a smearing incident, don’t make a big deal about it, just move on and she can try again the next day. Reserve the big deals for when she does something great! This is something that you and she can work on together and something that is very amenable to treatment using positive reinforcement.

        You are correct – the diagnostic criteria for Asperger’s include deficits in social interaction skills and narrow interests or repetitive patterns of behavior (language delays are not part of the criteria for Asperger’s – if language delays are present with the other two criteria, then Autism and other spectrum disorders are considered).   It’s very hard to tell from a written description whether a child meets diagnostic criteria, which is why in-person evaluation is crucial, but your description doesn’t suggest that he has the types of restricted interests and social delays you expect in a child with Asperger’s.  I would be inclined to trust your doctor’s opinion.

512,Who's Right?!,"
        Autism spectrum disorders are characterized by deficits in language and social interaction and restricted interests or repetitive patterns of behavior.  It doesn’t sound as though he meets these diagnostic criteria, although in-person evaluation by a professional is necessary to rule in or out any disorder.  It sounds as though your primary concern is his problem behavior, and I’d look to treat his problem behavior with consistency in both how you deal with his behavior and his medication.  Although I’m not aware of any information that suggests inconsistency in Keppra delivery would actually cause problem behavior, it’s extremely important for his health that he get the medication as prescribed by his doctor.  Further, antiepileptic medications are frequently helpful in managing behavior problems, but only if they are delivered consistently (so improving the med consistency might actually help, rather than hurt, his problem behavior).
My advice would be to pursue help with addressing his problem behaviors.  A Board-Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) will help you identify strategies to help reduce those problematic behaviors and teach more adaptive responses, regardless of your child's diagnosis.  A local BCBA can be found at the following website: http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html

513,Who's Right?!,"
        If you have read about autism it is a marked impairment in social, communication and the presence of a repetitive behavior.  How is his speech, is he talking?  It appears the onset of his seizures were when he was one year old.  Did anyone at the hospital back in 2009 refer you to a neurologist for the seizures? What does your pediatrician say?  You should look at some of the screening tests like the m-chat to see if there red flags for autism.  I am not a doctor but assuming the side effects of NOT taking the meds is ""not eating"" and ""temper tantrums"" is an assumption i wouldn't make.  I would take him to a professional.  If you are worried, you need to act and not sit and take the wait and see approach.  There are good professionals who can help you get intervention services he may need even if he doesn't have an autism diagnosis.  He sounds like he has sensory issues with food and there are OT professionals who that as well.
Hope this helps a little.  I know this is a worriesome time but get the right help and you will get the right answers. Listening to others thoughts are ok but you need to seek out the professionals who are experienced and qualified & trust your motherly instincts.

515,Risperidone,"
        Self-injury (SIB) is fairly common in individuals with autism and other developmental disabilities, and behavior analytic approaches to treatment can be quite successful. My first recommendation would be to try and obtain help from a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA; see the BCBA website for more information and a listing of local providers: http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html).  This specialist will want to spend time with you and your son to help determine how to best manage his behavior.

If your son engages in these behaviors at school, then the school (at least in the U.S.) is obliged to try and help safely and effectively manage these behaviors – either at the current school or by referring his case to a school that is able to help manage his behavior (I am guessing this might be why he has been referred for a residential assessment). They may have a BCBA or other behavior specialist involved in his case, so you might be able to contact the school and ask to speak with that person to get some advice on managing his behavior at home. 

As for the medication: The effects of a medication like Risperdal can be seen early in some cases, but in many cases no effects will be seen until a therapeutic level (which varies across people) has been achieved for several weeks.  So it’s very possible that it’s too early to tell whether the medication is helping.  The best way for you to assist a doctor in making this determination is by taking detailed notes on the frequency of the problem behavior each day, and bring that information to the doctor’s appointment (if you have the services of a BCBA, they can probably help you with this, as well).  The doctor may want to go thru a series of slow increases to help reach a therapeutic level, so this can take months in some cases.
Good luck to you and your family.

516,Asperger's Syndrome or not?,"
        Autism is diagnosed based on narrow or repetitive patterns of behavior or interests, severe and sustained impairment in social interactions, and delays in language acquisition.  Asperger’s is diagnosed when language acquisition is normal, but child behavior is characterized by repetitive behavior and social impairments.   Based on your description, it does sound as though he exhibits some language delays.  However, it’s tough to say whether he has real impairments in social skills or whether he is just shy (which is a very real possibility if he has cared for at home and has only recently joined pre-K).  Further, it is tough to say whether he exhibits the type of narrow and restricted patterns of behavior typical of autism – lots of typically-developing toddlers and young children engage in some stereotypy (or “stimming”), and it doesn’t sound like you are seeing a lot of stereotypy (hand flapping, body rocking, non-functional vocalizations are just a few common types) at home. 

The only way to really determine whether he meets criteria for an autism spectrum disorder is to have him evaluated in person by a qualified professional.  I would recommend that you describe your concerns to your pediatrician (who will be able to incorporate their own observations of your child with your descriptions and concerns) and ask whether further evaluation is a good idea. 

Best of luck

517,Asperger's Syndrome or not?,"
        I would formerly have him diagnosed.  It sounds like the suggestion has been made and the signs and symptoms are compelling.  My son is 11 and has PDD-NOS (also part of the autism spectrum).  He was diagnosed when he was 8.  I have been doing a lot of research recently and am now advocating for autism and my son.  Based upon the delay in speech, spinning to ground himself, his solitary classroom involvement, and his above average intelligence I think there are enough signs for a possible diagnosis.  

Go with your instinct.  Stop second guessing yourselves.  I did that too which is why my son didn't get diagnosed until he was 8 and becoming harmful to himself and others.  It's because I was being told that I just needed to be more consistent and it was because he had the run of the house as a toddler and he was the boss of my husband and I, which really wasn't so.  

There are no two children alike on the spectrum.  It's very hard to get an accurate diagnosis.  For more information and a great resource check out www.autismspeaks.org

518,24 Month old Little Girl autism,"
        There is a fairly broad range in what is considered normal development, and it’s not unusual for a child to have brief pauses in language acquisition or the development of social skills and interactions. However, it’s just not possible to tell whether what you are describing is within the range of normal – only an in-person evaluation by a qualified professional can really answer your question.  I’d suggest that describe your concerns to your pediatrician and ask whether s/he thinks that referral to a specialist for further evaluation is necessary. They may recommend evaluation by a speech pathologist or other professional, or they might find her development to be relatively normal.  If they don’t recommend follow-up and you still don’t see improvement within a few months, you might want to bring your concerns back to your pediatrician and ask again for a referral to a specialist.

        Given the description you’ve provided, I recommend having your son assessed by a professional with experience diagnosing individuals with autism. Pediatricians often have little experience making these diagnoses and are, in most cases, not the best person to be making them. The types of problem behavior that you describe are often observed in children with autism diagnoses, most often due to deficits in their communication skills. 
In addition to having your son assessed by someone with expereience diagnosing individuals with autism, I also recommend seeking treatment for his problem behavior regardless of the diagnoses. Find a behavior analyst in your area who has treated behavior of this sort before. For children like your son who don’t have concomitant intellectual delays, these behaviors can be very effectively treated by teaching him appropriate ways to communicate his wants and needs. For example, preferred activities, such as tv and games on the computer, can be provided following appropriate on-task behavior at school and at home.

The most important thing is to make sure that she understands what the rules of the sparring matches are and that hitting and kicking is not OK outside of this context. If she has made it this far in the sport, it would seem that she would be able to understand these things and differentiate between sparring and aggression. There isn’t any reason to believe that allowing her to spar in a sport that she already participates in would result in her becoming more aggressive in general. Just be very clear with the rules, monitor her closely during sparring, and you can always end her participation if problems arise.

        Courtney,

I haven't taken my son anywhere yet - I'm waiting for a couple of speech\language places to call me back and\or schedule some appts.  I did call a few former coworkers (one a psychologist and another a SLP) to discuss his issues (they never physically saw him, we just talked about him).  The psychologist said basically the big indicators are pointing - in her experience autistic kids just don't typically point especially when it comes to pointing to things far off (my son will occasionally point to things of interest when we're in the car and make a noise like he's commenting) so what he's doing is sharing joint attention.  Given that fact and the fact he doesn't seem to have social issues and no stereotyped behaviors she wouldn't say he was in the spectrum.  

The SLP at first was concerned about him not using words he once did (like language regression), but after telling her more about what he does she thinks that he just doesn't view himself as 'having a voice' and that speaking can help him get what he wants - he just seems to think of himself as independent.  She recommended that I start picking just a few things each day that he has to try to say before he gets it.  She would also like for him to have an audiology appt. to make sure that he doesn't have ear issues that had gone undetected (just because he doesn't have a history of ear infections, doesn't mean that his ears wouldn't be plugged up and not hearing all the sounds).

I do know one option is to take your son to a developmental pediatrician for an evaluation and\or psychologist.  I'm going to look at this for the time being as a speech delay issue and then if someone sees something different then I'll take that route.  Hopefully I'll be able to make some changes to get him talking soon!

Fortunately, all of the areas of difficulty that you mention can be improved with systematic behavioral intervention.

It’s great that he’s receiving early intervention, the more the better! The first priority needs to be making sure he’s in an educational setting that is providing him the services he needs and then making sure the skills that you feel are most important for him are being targeted and that he’s receiving the hours of direct teaching time that he needs.

Maybe they can put her in a social speech class at school where she practices with other children how to use social language.  If you live in the USA, the school needs to help her by evaluating her issues and proving help.  If her behavior is impacting her academic performance, she might be eligible for an IEP.   Google IEP and public school intervation to make sure you understand the help that is available to you (assuming she is in public school in the US).  You need to advocate for her because nobody else will.  Good luck (I am the mom of a similar girl).

        I have a 12 year old daughter that had the same problems when she was in elementary school. She is now in middle school and my how things have changed. Some kids just take longer to develop socially. 
Some of the things that we did to help with the social aspect in school was to 1) talk with the councelor. She has a wealth of information and can be a HUGE help. 2) talk with her teacher, explain to her that she is doing her homework, she is just to shy to turn it in. The teacher will come up with some suggestions. More times than not the teacher has seen this before. 3) Call for an ARD-the teacher or the ladies at the front office will tell you what it is that you need to do. If it's like here, you will need to call the diagnostician and request one-no one can tell you no. It's your right to request one. Before you get to the ard make sure you have all your questions written down and all your ""proof"" with you. They can give her some help to succeed in school and an IEP (it is special education, but it can help her in school). If they don't believe she needs an IEP then ask for a 504 plan-and have some ideas on what you would like to see for your child (accomodations)...i.e a homework folder that she can leave in her desk and after school the teacher can get it and grade her papers.

        I had a similar problem when I was in middle school (I'm 18 now).  It's worth keeping in mind that grades as such don't -usually- matter before the highschool level, in terms of her long term prospects.  I was often unable to turn in assignments if I was slightly late, or if I didn't have them done on the day they were due, because I didn't want to draw attention to myself by speaking to the ""turn in"" kid at my table about it, or subject myself to their judgement of the fact that I was turning in late work.  The usual advice to think about how much I noticed when someone else turned in late work didn't work for me, because I have too much extra brain space, and I notice everything.  
Please don't force your daughter to socialize, or work on her social skills in an artificial context.  In my experience it doesn't help, and will probably embarass her.  That said, you also shouldn't go out of your way to indulge her lack of social skills.  Don't do things for her that a girl her age should be able to handle, whatever that amounts to at her age. See if for some classes, she could submit homework as an email attatchment.  Many aspies have an easier time with online interaction than by phone or in person, and she may socialize more with friends if she can talk to them, and arrange to hang out in person, via internet (with age appropriate supervision).  If she's highschool age, and interested, you could help her enroll in a general psych class at a local community college, which could help if she has aspurger's because it goes over the ""what"" and ""why"" of aspects of human nature and interaction which are intuitive to most people, but not to aspies.

542,PDD or Asperger's?,"
        I would definitely have your daughter seen by a team specializing in developmental disabilities in young children.  The diagnosis of OCD in a child who is not yet three years of age seems somewhat unusual to me (likewise, the suggestion for medication).  Other than saying your daughter has no social skills, you have not described much of her behavior.  You did mention that she has been receiving early intervention program (EIP) services since the age of less than one year, which leads me to believe that deficits (things like lack of communication, social relatedness) and excesses (preoccupation with objects, repetitive behavior) must have been pretty distinct at a very young age.  If she has been receiving EIP services, I recommend you work with her team there to come up with a plan for addressing your daughter’s development and challenging behaviors as soon as possible.  It is unfortunate that sometimes it does take a long time to get the appropriate assessments, but it is very important to obtaining the proper intervention for your daughter.  Below is a list of websites that you might find helpful in learning more about pervasive developmental disorders.

543,PDD or Asperger's?,"
        Thank you for answering my question, as far as being concerned with her development, we have been concerned since she was about 2 months old (10 weeks) when she slept for over an entire week and was hospitalized (later learning that she had a liver infection-whether it was from that or something else, they don't know). At the age of 6 months she still wasn't smiling or laughing and had generalized hypotonia. It took us until she was almost 1 before we could get some help for her, it orginally was for dysphia when her speech therapist noticed that she might have SPD. It was 2 weeks later an OT agreed and she started intense therapy for SPD. She is a very hypersensitive child with all 7 of her senses. She doesn't understand social cues from other people, when I am upset with her I have to show her my face and ask if I look happy at her-and tell her that I am not, doesn't have the traditional imaginative play others her age do. For example, she ""plays"" with her dolls but instead of talking to them and acting like a mom she would rather carry them around in their carrier or in the backpack, nothing more. She also has an adult like humor that other children don't seem to understand, not that she would talk to them. She doesn't like to spin, but she likes to watch other things spin. When she was a baby, it was the ceiling fan and now it's anything that spins from ice skating to chairs to car wheels. She has a fascination with red cars, no other type-just red. She does like to have her schedule the same as much as possible and when it's way off, she is not comfortable and will cry and refuse to do anything else but stay at home. She also likes to watch her movies over and over again and can recite one of them word for word -even before the character says it. 

When it comes to the anxiety and OCD-she washes her hands for hours at a time if I let her. She has to get in the car a certain way, be buckled a certain way, go to bed a certain way, get dressed the same way, go up and down stairs a certain way, milk has to be made a certain way, scared to ""go fast"" in the car since she believes we are going to ""run over a car"", scared to sleep alone-afraid of the ""niner"" (a make believe character that comes at 9 o'clock) and of the dark because of it. Scared of ""the guy""-any man besides her father. We have no idea why, she can't even explain it. Clothing has to match and knows when it's not and will undress herself and refuse to wear it until it matches -including her hairbows or even the rubber bands and her socks. Can only wear one brand of diapers (she is not even close to being potty trained as of yet).
I hope that gives you a little more insight to my daughter.

        It is always a difficult situation when you have concerns about a friend’s child’s development, and they don’t “see” what you are talking about.  Particularly when the family’s pediatrician is saying that there is nothing wrong.  (Pediatricians are usually the first contact point for accessing additional assessments and services.)  One point that I should make is that many of the behaviors you are describing can be typical of any developing two-year-old child (and the younger the child, the wider the range of these behaviors).  It usually comes down to the frequency of these behaviors that is indicative of a problem.  Below are several websites with information about autism spectrum disorders (some specific to early identification).  You may find it helpful to review these sites and see if your concerns are valid.  

All I can suggest is that you use your judgment in discussing your concerns with your friend.  Perhaps a mutual friend or, if you have a relationship with another family member of your friend, they may help.  No one wants to hear that their child may have a problem.  I strongly advise that you use all the sensitivity and patience you possess in trying to talk to your friend.

547,wierd behavior,"
        It sounds like your son is being a bit goofy and playful when you are asking him to focus on some academic work. This sort of thing is, of course, quite common for all kids, not just those with an autism diagnosis. Typically, the way this sort of thing is addressed is through identifying something that is reinforcing for your son, a favorite activity, movie, snack, game, etc… And then setting up a little contingency for him where he sits with you and focuses on work for some period of time and then earns some of that favorite thing for a while. A little work, a little play, start with the work periods being rather short, perhaps just whatever amount of time he’ll give you at first, even if it’s only a few seconds. It sounds like he really enjoys your attention so some play with you might be something he earns, some tickles, a high five, or any other interaction he likes, then another round of work. Be systematic about it, arrange particular times when you do this with him, make sort of a game out of it so that it’s enjoyable for both of you. As he gets better at giving you the focus for some work, you can slowly increase the amount of time or work he needs to do. Let his behavior guide you in determining if he can handle it. Just keep in mind how important it is to be consistent. When you’re doing this, make sure that he is only getting your attention through focusing and working and that you’re ignoring the goofiness, chasing after him and making a big deal about his not listening to you will only encourage him to do it more.

548,my 12yr old girl has autism and wont go poop in toilet,"
        Difficulties in toilet training for children diagnosed with autism are very common. Fortunately, they are also usually very treatable. Interventions typically involve starting with frequent, scheduled times for sitting on the toilet and differential reinforcement of producing on the toilet rather than having accidents. This is often combined with prompting and instructions that are faded out, along with fading the frequency of the schedule of sitting on the toilet, once production on the toilet is reliable. I recommend that you seek out a behavior analyst in your area that has experience implementing these types of programs. They need to be monitored closely and there are professionals that have extensive experience successfully teaching children with autism to use the toilet. A good place to start looking is the BACB website: http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html

        You are obviously in a very difficult position and it sounds like the first thing that needs to happen is for you and your husband to get on the same page regarding priorities for your son’s education. I can’t make those decisions for you but raising a child with autism can be a wonderful, rewarding experience but also extremely challenging. Your son needs you and your husband working together, not only for the good of your relationship but also because his education does not end when he gets home from school. Get together with your husband, prioritize the skills you feel are most needed for your son, and make sure those are in his IEP.

553,my 3 &1/2 year old boy possible Asperger's Syndrome?,"
        It sounds as though your son is experiencing some difficulty at school that he doesn’t necessarily display at home.  Although this doesn’t mean these problems at school are not important, it does decrease the likelihood that a diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome is appropriate.  Asperger’s syndrome is diagnosed based on deficits in social interaction skills and repetitive behavior or highly restricted interests; because he displays normal social behavior and language at home, it sounds as though he doesn’t really meet those criteria.  

It is not uncommon for toddlers and young children to be described as rigid and for them to have tantrums about unexpected (or non-preferred) changes; you might try by verbally preparing him before he is presented with these changes or events and see if that helps.  However, if you feel that his behavior is extreme and you continue to be concerned, I would explain your concerns to your pediatrician and ask whether a referral to another professional is appropriate.
Good luck

555,Hand flapping over exited.,"
        It does not sound as though he is displaying two of the three diagnosis criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders - delays in social interaction skills or communication skills that cannot be attributed to another organic disorder (like cerebral palsy) –  so I would not be overly concerned with pursuing a diagnosis of autism solely based on the fact that he engages in stereotypy ( the hand flapping you described).  

Stereotypic behavior (simple repetitive movements like body rocking, hand flapping, non-functional vocalizations) is a fairly common problem that is seen in both individuals with developmental disorders and in typically- developing infants and children. Research shows that this behavior is typically occurring as a form of self-stimulation (rather than a way to access attention or other events), and that it is not harmful so long as it is not interfering with skill acquisition or producing some type of risk.   If the stereotypy is interfering with his learning, you might try some simple interventions to reduce the stereotypy: if he is supposed to be working, redirect him back to the task; when stereotypy does occur, prompt him to place his hands on the table or his lap; finally, try finding some toys that have stronger sensory properties (vibrating toys, etc.) and allowing him time to play with those.  Because stereotypy is such a common problem, I wouldn’t worry that it has deeper implications or pursue further diagnoses.  

Regardless of his diagnosis, childhood behavior problems like stereotypy can typically be addressed through consultation with a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA).  If you feel that the behavior is stigmatizing or interfering with more adaptive behaviors and the simple interventions I noted above haven’t been effective, you may want to consult with a BCBA.  The school district may have a behavior analyst on staff that can provide some recommendations, or you can contact a local BCBA at the following site: http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html.

        Many children on the spectrum do hand flap.  One of them is my 6 year old.  However, you may want to look into Sensory Processing Disorder first.  The behavior you described is sensory based.  If he doesn't show the social aspects of autism I'd start there.  Making an appointment with your local OT is a great place to start.  Make sure they have experience with pediactric/sensory.  If not it is worth your time to go to the closest one who does.  Hope that helps you.

557,has my son got autisum,"
        It’s not possible to say whether a diagnosis of autism is appropriate without an in-person evaluation by a qualified professional.  I presume that the psychologist that evaluated him at his school provided some type of summary report or recommendations for further evaluation, so if you haven’t already been provided a copy of that report, I would recommend that you ask the school for a copy.  The diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including Autism and several other disorders) include delays in language development, social skills, and typically the presence of severely restricted interests and/or stereotyped behaviors, so the psychologist’s report should indicate which of those characteristics your son shows and how (hopefully, s/he will have cited some specific examples of his your son’s behavior does or does not conform to those diagnostic criteria).   If the psychologist hired by the school did not do a formal evaluation, you should probably explain your concerns to your pediatrician and ask his/her opinion on whether it would be a good idea for you to pursue a more formal evaluation (and rule in or out a diagnosis of autism).

558,Is my son autistic?,"
        Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including Autism, Aspergers, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests.  Based on your description, it doesn’t sound as though he meets any of those criteria to the extent necessary for a PDD diagnosis.  However, in-person evaluation by a qualified professional is necessary for any diagnosis.  If you have reason to disagree with the opinion of the counselor, you might want to bring this to the attention of your pediatrician and ask for his/her opinion on whether pursuing a second opinion (from another counselor or psychologist) is worth your time.  

Keep in mind that whatever his diagnosis (or lack thereof), solid approaches to treating these problems will probably include trying to build social skills to help him develop stronger and more diverse family and friend relationships.  Helping him find activities that he enjoys and friends with which he can do these activities might itself be a good starting point. If he is good at guitar or enjoys video games, try to get him engaged in a local club or other social group where he might find friends with similar interests.   

Best of luck.

561,"12 year old Grandson , Asperger's Anger issues","
        Unfortunately, without information as to why he is engaging in this aggressive behavior, it is difficult to determine how to effectively reduce the behavior. In addition, I’m reluctant to give you any specific advice about trying to change his behavior, as it sounds like his behavior could be severe and it’s not unusual for changes in ways of dealing with problem behavior to result in at least initial increases in behavior severity or frequency.  

My recommendation would be to obtain some local professional help.
If he has a diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome, then I presume that he is receiving special education services already.  Many schools provide structured behavioral support for students in special education, so you might try asking the school if they have a Behavior Analyst on their staff who might be able to help you address his behavior at home (or at least tell you how they are managing it at school, and how successful it has been).  If they do not have a qualified professional working on his case, and you are able to potentially pay out of pocket for additional help, my recommendation would be to locate a  Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) who has experience dealing with problem behavior and Asperger’s syndrome. The BACB website has a local service provider directory at http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html

Although different districts handle cases such as this differently, school districts are required to provide the least intrusive but most effective learning environment for students.  Sometimes this means students who cannot be served effectively in the home district are placed out in residential placements. If the school has referred him to residential programs for evaluation, it sounds as though they are anticipating this might be a necessary step for him, and in many cases school districts will pay part or all of the tuition for residential schools.  Again, however, each case is different. 

Given the potentially complex nature of his case, an educational advocate might be helpful – advocates are individuals who are familiar with local school districts and special education services and can help families when it comes to negotiating with the school district on student services.   The Federation for Children with Special Needs can provide a referral for a local advocate (800- 331-0688). 
Best of luck to you and your family

The diagnoses are behavioral and there are often differing opinions about whether or not a particular child should receive a particular diagnosis. While it may be helpful to get yet another opinion about diagnosis, you know for a fact that your son struggles and could use help in some areas. I would recommend targeting the particular issues that are difficult for him. Seek out a behavior analyst or behavior therapist in your area that has experience working with children like your son. This person should work with you on developing specific goals for him and interventions to work toward those goals.

        Did a Specialist give you the diagnosis of PDD NOS? I am not a doctor or specialist, but you sound like you have ADD or maybe PDD NOS with ADD. Have you tried any ADD meds such as stimulants (Ritalin, Metadate or Adderall)? If you have not and you are not against them (some people are) you should see a ADD specialist doctor who can evaluate you for ADD and if he agrees you could try one of the ADD meds. It takes trying different ones to see which one works for you but in some cases they can make a big difference if you can find the one that does work for you. Good luck.

571,Certain vitamins do help in PDD NOS but not on a structural level,"
        According to the specialists (clinical psychologist & ortho pedagogue) that diagnosed me, by confronting me with a battery of test, they said that I do not have ADD, because i have no trouble with sustained attention. 

At first, i also thought i had ADD. 

But because I want a second opinion I will also visit a psychiatrist specialised in this field. Maybe a medicin like ritalin would benefit me.

572,Certain vitamins do help in PDD NOS but not on a structural level,"
        I believe that some people with PDD-NOS and even autism will take the ADD medicines to help them with their ""execution function"".  Good luck and getting a second opinion is a good idea since you really seem to have goals and want do well in life. Issues with execution is part of ADD diagnosis.  Are you a social person who has friends and talks to them like your peers do? if so, you probably do not have PDD.  The ADD person is social and knows how to be social.  He or she just gets bored with the conversation and changes the topic or ignores it totally after a while.  The PDD person will care less about having friends. I am not an expert, I am just a mom. Please see an expert for a second opinion and get help.  Make sure that you see someone that understands ADD. You might look at the CHADD web site and see if they have a chapter where you live.

        I think the comments from another parent of a child with an autism diagnosis are very valuable here. Your son is still your son. You won't break him but he is unique and discovering his strengths and weaknesses will be a lifelong journey. It sounds like you are on the right track, seeking out professionals in your area. There are people who have vast experience and expertise teaching and working with children similar to your son. The most important thing is to get him early intervention as soon as possible. 

There are a vast array of proposed treatments for individuals with autism and they are often quite expensive. Learning to navigate through the research and propaganda and identifying the best treatment for your child is one of the most difficult tasks that you will have. The most important thing for you to do is to test and prove that an intervention works for your son. While I respect the strong opinions that others have on the topic, dietary treatments cannot be considered an empirically supported treatment for individuals diagnosed with autism. In my experience and based on the research in the area and the position of the scientific community, I would strongly recommend that you do not spend your money on them. There is no convincing evidence that any improvements on a diet of that sort are any greater than what would have been observed if the diet had never been implemented. In fact, most high-quality treatment centers refuse to implement them. The most effective and most supported intervention is applied behavior analysis. For that reason, I recommend all parents of individuals diagnosed with autism seek out behavior analytic services. As you get to know more professionals with experience working with individuals with autism, draw from what they know. Ask for help and advice. At the end of the day, it is up to you to prove to yourself that your son is benefiting from the services that he’s getting. This seems like an enormously daunting task but you’ll definitely get there.

        Hi
I have a four year old daughter with autism.  I know exactly what you are going through. Although you're freaking out right now, and rightfully so, it will get better.  To help you I need to know where you live, what country because it's different everywhere.
First thing...don't yell at him or punish him.  I think the first thing you need to do is to learn about him.  He's still your boy whom you always knew, but there's a completely other level to him you need to learn about.  You need to understand autism.  What kinds of things is he doing that you feel you need to punish him for?  I may be able to help a bit and let you know if this is a characteristic of autism or just typical three year old behavior.  I still have a hard time figuring that one out too and we've had our diagnoses for a year.  I read a lot about Autism and go to as many classes, workshops, or seminars as I can and or afford.  Note though, if it is tantrums don't punish him.  He's doing them for a reason and usually it's because they can't communicate with you or understand what's going on around them.  Our world is very scary to these guys.
You need to remember that he doesn't perceive the world as we do.  Where is he on the spectrum?  He is in a totally different world than you and it's up to you to get into his world and bring him out.  I know that sounds trippy and really scary but I can explain this more if you tell me more about your son.  I have lots of info and suggestions as to where you can learn more if you are interested.  Remember you're not alone and neither is he.  These children are gifts to the world and will teach you so much and will humble you.  Every little achievement my daughter makes I go nuts over.  I was so proud of her when she finally understood the concept of yes at three or learned to play patty cake at three.  You'll appreciate so much more.  All the best :)  I hope I can help you out.

        ok i wanna say thank u so much first and second i live in saint john new brunswick canada, they didnt tell me how for on the spectrum he is at but i will say from just me maybe i just dont see it all the time but i think he is pretty high functioning. my mother is the one who told me to have him checked. i am a first time single mother and i thought he was ""normal"", i woud yell at my mother tell her she only had girls and boys are different and he will catch on or catch up before school.
 now that we have the diagonsis i see where they came up with that , i have done some research on it and he is very visually smart like on a high way he knows what exit to get off to go to fredericton where my mom lives or the second exit to go to my dads or if u keep going straight were going to the camp and he says bike. he knows where all the coffee shops are in town because he knows hes gonna get a doughnut and he thinks he is going to daycare every day of the week. he is very high strung all the time it is very hard to get him to bed at night i have to lay down with him in my bed he wont sleep in his now i used to just let him cry it out but since i got the diagnosis of autism i have a hard time letting him cry at all. he loves cars trucks and busses he hates to be on a bus he is sooo scared. but that is all he will play with and he lines them up and i cant take one out of the line or play with him
. when he was on a routine i had all his toys in his room and he would het his million trucks and cars and line them up on his bed and sleep on the floor so i had to remove them fromm there and thats when it became my bed to sleep in and i dont know how to get him out, he freaks out over everthing as well.he is totally unsafe to be out side he will run after a moving car if it looks like one of my parents or when he sees my steep fathers truck in his work parking lot ( which is a mall) he will dart for it with no care of getting hit. he has tried to get into strangers cars to pla with the steering wheel i have had ppl actually walk me into my apt so he would go into the house with little fuss about not playing in there car. he is not interested in playing at the park or with other children. he doesnt praticapate at daycare however he loves going there, he doesnt talk maybe 20 words or so and has a speech therapist and we have only seen her 4 times and he asks for her all the time when hes not goig to daycare he thinks hes going there he has no consumption that its the weekend and we only go on the weekdays. hes very loving tho which is good but maybe too loving if there is such a thing. he grinds his teeth because he doesnt know how to proccess his love and thats how it comes out he has never picked one fav thing so he tangles his fingers in my hair and when he is sick he will suck my hair,\
    we are waiting for the autism clinic to start with apts we have a needs apt on jan 18th and he will spend a total of 14 hours a week there to get him ready for school in a year and a half. and hopefiully they can tell me how high on the spectrum he actually is. and the autism clinic has parenting classes as well and i will be taking them,
  i just dont know what he understands like the art of munipulation when a child thinks hes won in a battle i dont know if thats what he thinks or hes just happy im with him, and as for the punishing part it was always hard to give him a time out actually it was never dont and stuck, its just what i thought was normal isnt and i dont know whats what i am scared to sleep with out a baby gate at my door in fear he will get out he knows how to unlock the chain lock and theres no bolt but i think he would know that to. life is turned up side down how do u turn it up side right again

        From your description I have a pretty good idea of what he's like.  He sounds a lot like my daughter and some of her friends.  I want you to know that he's going to be alright!!!!  It's not going to be easy and it is going to require a lot of work on your behalf.  There's a lot to do in such a small window of time.  They say children with Autism have a window of opportunity where they obsorbe and learn so much info.  It use to be six but data now shows it's 8.  After 8 they are still able to learn just not as much as fast.
14 hours of intervention (therapy) is not bad.  Where I live BC I use to get 20 then we had gov't cuts recently and now I'm down to 10.  I will let you know that research recommends 20-25 hours min. of therapy per week.  So it's usually up to the parents to do it.  Anyway, I wont get too much into that as I don't want to overwhelm you more.  There is a lot of info out there and it can be very overwhelming for a parent to figure out what they should do for their child. Have you heard of Jenny McCarthy?  Her son has autism and she's put out some amazing stuff.  Not all people agree with her, but I think a lot of her stuff is fantastic and I've used a lot of her suggestions with my daughter and have found great results.  So websites to check out Teach2Talk is a good one, and TACA Talk About Curing Autism.  These sites are american, but the info is all the same.  I'll message you more sites.
You talk about him knowing where he is going.  These kids thrive on routine.  Routine is everything in their lives.  I know if I go out of routine with my daughter it completely messes her up especially when it comes to sleep.  Welcome to the world of no sleep.  My daughter is a complete monkey when it comes to sleep.  Like last night she was up until after 1.  She stays in her bed a recites her movies or stories but she's up.  I've had problems with her sleeping from day one.  Sometimes she gets up in the middle of the night and doesn't go back to bed at all.  When she was younger I had to sleep on her floor for six months because she would get so upset.  Don't punish him for it or let him cry it out.  I would wait and talk to your behavioral consultant and they can give you some program to help you get him to settle and sleep on his own.
Most of the time tantrums are because he can't communicate to you what he's feeling, needing or wanting.  The next thing beside routine that is crucial for these guys are visual schedules.  I'm sure your consultant will tell you more about this.  But once you have him on one of these then you guys will have more ways to communicate and he will start understanding more of whats going on around him.  When I got Addy working with a visual schedule (which is just pics of what is going to happen in order ex lunch, story, nap, or pics of choices he can choose from ex: juice or water) it totally helped with tantrums.  Whenever she has a tantrum that I know it's because she's not understanding what's going on I pull out our visuals.  But that should be a big part of his life. HUGE!!!
You say he has 20 words.  That's good that he has words.:)  A good book to read is More than Words.  It will help you find out where he is at and how you can help him.  It's an easy read and very informative.
Do something about that door of yours!!!!  I have friends that their kids escape during the night.  These kids have no concept of safety.  You have to teach them EVERYTHING!  For his safety I recommend getting baby locks for the door or something.  I have one on my door too.
I have so much to tell you and don't want to overwhelm you with info.  But always feel free to talk to me about this.  It's a life long journey with many challanges on the way but great surprises too.  Your little man is going to teach you so much about life.  I really think these guys see things at their purest.  There are many advantages to having autism I think.  We just need to help these little guys cope with the world so that they can have the chance to live an enriched life and show everyone what they're made of.
Your reaction to your mom is so typical.  Everyone has a story like that to tell.  I knew my daughter had autism but I was in denial.  If my man were to say anything was wrong I'd pounce on him but secretly I would go to my mom and ask her for her opinion. :)
If you're interested there are many therapies out there for your child to try.  ABA is the only evidence based one that works so it's a must have, but if you're interested in knowing any of the others like supplements, cleanses, diets I'd be happy to tell you about them and my experience.  I wont throw that on you now, but I'm here if you want to know.
A little about my monkey...she's four and was diagnosed when she was three.  She knew her planets in order before she was two, her letters, numbers, shapes and colours.  This kid has an amazing memory.  Right now she knows all the countries of North, South and Central America.  This is called a splinter skill.  She had some language but most of her language was echolalia which is repeating things she hears ex: from movies or books.  A year latter she's telling me what she wants, likes, dislikes, and just starting to tell me what she has done.  Her expressive language is higher than her comprehension of language which is hard to remember sometimes.  She didn't play with toys properly.  She loved to line them up or do ""physics"" experminets.  That's starting to change now.  I have been learning how important play is for all kids and especially for these guys.  Appropriate play is the building blocks of EVERYTHING, socialization, communication, problem solving you name it.  Anyway, she's very quirky.  She has lots of silly little things she does that at times can be uncomfortable around people who aren't sure of her, but that's my issue I'm trying to cope with.  She is such a picky little eater which is very common with children on the spectrum.  She's very hard to play with because she's so rigid.  She has sensory issues too.  A lot of this stuff is helping her to overcome.  Like she's in gymnastics and this week was the first time she went on the high balance beam.  She would scream bloody murder before.  But that day she must have been feeling pretty confident.  It's all baby steps with these guys I'm learning.  Her great accomplishment right now is understanding how the computer mouse works.  Now she's plaing sesame street games. :)
When I got the diagnoses I felt all my motherly intuition was thrown away.  I had no idea how to parent her. and I had to mourn the loss of my idea of my daughter and who she was.  The best advice I can give is to get as much info about autism in your head.  Don't worry about disciplin quite yet.  First try and understand who he is.  Autism is a big part of who  he is and in order to help him you need to understand that part of him.  But from what you said he sounds lovely.
All the best.  Keep in touch!

        Hey
I recommend looking into groups where you live.  I found before I met people in the same boat as me I was swallowed up into Autism.  It was hard.  But when I finally found people, moms in particular going through the same thing it took me out of this lonely world I was experiencing.  It can be very hard sometimes and having someone around who you can get out with helps...but I'm always here so you can always chat with me :)  Making friends for Riley will be a tough one and it will hurt at times.  I will kid you not.  That's probably the hardest part for me.  It just breaks my heart.  She so badly wants to play with the kids, and now the kids are older and don't understand some of her quirky behavior.  They can be mean...even at 3 and 4.  Though I know they just don't understand, but it doesn't hurt any less.  I  can just imagine how Adriana feels.
Anyway, diet.  HUGE believer.  When I found out that Ariana may have autism right away I put her on the diet.  It's a glueten and Casein free diet.  Pretty much no wheat or dairy.  It's not an easy diet to do.  It's very hard.  But it can't hurt them it can only make them stronger.  Each child reacts to it differently.  I know of someone who put their son on the diet and within 24 hours he spoke.  Before he couldn't say anything.  My daughter, she became more focused, better eye contact, longer senteces, less hand flapping, more engaged within three weeks. I do a lot of naturopathic things with her.  She's on supplements, cleanses, and different diets.  I'm looking into the body ecology diet.  It's with no starches.  I had Addy on a yeast cleanse and found it remarkable, but since she's been off it I've noticed she's very unfocussed.  So I'm looking into that.  Try to find a DAN doctor around you if you're interested.  It's expensive, but they treat children with autism.  They are all natural approaches.  They find exactly what your child is allergic to, what minerals/vitamins your child lacks, what toxic substances your child has in their body.  Addy has too much mercury, alluminum, arsenic in her body.  So we're cleansing her of that.  I'll let you know how it goes.  We've not done it yet.  It's all very interesting.  I figure it doesn't hurt her.  We're healing her body in order to heal her mind.  You don't need a doctors approval.  Research it if you want before you go out and buy it.  BUt my DAN doctor told us right away to do the gluten free casein free diet, put her on a teaspoon of Cod liver oil, that is to help with speach and brain development, and no more tuna.  Tuna is full of mercury.  The majority of these kids have mercury overload.  So doing that can't hurt Riley.
Babysitter....You need someone who understands Autism and understands your son.  Until you find that I would hold off on going out.  We don't have any family around so we don't go out much.  The only time we do is if I've got her asleep and a close friend comes over.  My monkey has major anxiety issues.  They have seemed to lessen as time goes on.  Visual schedule has helped with that as well as the supplement Taurine.  Everything is so different for her.  What seems perfectly normal for me is completely insane for her.  Like if I switched something in her routine without warning.  That brings on a melt down.  I remember one time I took a different route on our walk and she just broke down.  I had no clue why...at the time.  Or my man will try to pull the wagon with her in it and if I'm around she'd scream because I have to pull the wagon.  My man still has a hard time putting her to bed and doing her d\bed routine.  It upsets her too much.
What do you mean what works with other kids doesn't work for him?  Other kids with autism?  These kids are a mystery and such a puzzle.  Moms are always having to play detective.  It's exhausting.  And once you figure them out it always seems like something new has surfaced and your starting all over again.  That's how I feel anyway.
DON""T take away the things your child loves!!!!!!  That's cruel.  However, limit it when you can.  At first you should be getting into his world and allowing him to trust you before you ask him to take part in yours.  So when he's spinning the tires on his cars or what not go sit in front of him and spin a car.  See if he looks at you.  Try that for awhile.  It might encourage him to want you to be with him to play or to communicate in some form.  Just do what he does and copy what he does.  After some time when you see that he's getting comfortable with you add something.  Like a word, or a new action, or a different car.  Bring a new toy to the table/floor and do something major simple and prompt him to do it with you.  Always when he's done something different and new reward him with things he loves.  Never food though.  You can totally use the things he obssess over to help him learn and try new things.  I'm telling you get the book More than Words.  Fabulous!!!!!  Addy had  not much of a toy selection.  She liked her stuffies and animal figures.  She never wanted to play toys with me.  Now she's getting better and more intersted in other toys.  Though those others are still her fav.  But she has tea parties with me now, is doing puzzles, games.  I just can't get her interested in playing kitchen.  :(  I so badly want to play house again. :)
Well gotta run.  We'll chat soon.  
Have a Merry Christmas!!!!

        Hi

I hate to interrupt this thread , but my 3.5 yr old son sounds veryy similar to your girls

I would love to get some advice.He has been recently diagnosed with autism spectrum.He is an extremely bright kid with excellent memory.He knew reading ABC 1-20, planets day months colors continents by age 3.He taught him to write uppercase lowercase and 1-10.

But he lacks social cues and unable to focus on activities too long.He is better at 1 on 1 activities,but in a preschool setting where he has to coexist in a group , he just moves out and isolates himself.He cant focus , and wont sit still for too long.He is a happy kid and never has tantrums and he is developing perfectly well physically.He has recently started making friend's in the neighborhood..but does not necessarily know how to play with them , max for 5 mins he may run with them..then he goes into his own world but when he does not meet them for 1-2 days , he misses them and talks about them.He has a huge vocabulary, but his sentence formation is still delayed.In preschool teachers kind of get fed up as he aways wanders away into other classrooms and gets in other kids way.He is very restless  He takes other kids things (BUT does NOT destroy anything).He goes to Early intervention classes 2 days a week.He loves going to school.But teachers find it hard to handle him. 

Please advice what can I do help my son be calm and attentive and less restless.I want to be able to teach him how to complete tasks that he begins.

581,Could my son have Asperger's?,"
        Autism-spectrum disorders are characterized by impairments in communication and social interaction and also preservative patterns of behavior. Based on your description, I would suggest having your son assessed. The criteria are behavioral so they are always up for interpretation and a diagnosis given by one professional may not be given by another. The assessment and identification of an appropriate diagnosis can be valuable but it is also valuable to pursue avenues that may be beneficial for your son even if he doesn’t meet the criteria for a diagnosis. You can get him help for his social interaction and his perseveration on routine. There are therapists and behavior analysts who have experience working with children like your son. I would recommend seeking them out and finding someone who you and your son work well with. The earlier you can get him a little additional help, the more he’ll benefit.

        I worked with a girl that had Asperger's and as time went on with lots of patience she learned to adapt to society and was even in the jr high then high school band- percussion. Anything memorized could be expected high scores on school work but as she got older, more complex ideas and higher level thinking skills showed to be frustrating for her. You can still have the work modified- She learned to read easily using phonics since she could learn all the phonics rules.
We used lots of modeling to show her different reactions to things so she could memorize those- for instance when she was old enough- around age 10-we told her spelling words for her tests sometimes would be out of order - not always the way she had studied them in sequence..... something that always sent her into a meltdown.... We taught her to say things like- ""oh it's ok"" and ""maybe next time"". She saw a child psychiatrist for several visits who prescribed anti anxiety meds which helped A LOT. (Zoloft) Her family doctor then took over prescribing these and of course had to increase the meds and monitor as she aged.
You can also teach social skills by modeling - we taught her to ask ""how are you today?"" and TRY to listen to the answer to play into a conversation. write me if you need to chat

        If my memory serves me right, Aspergers children usually have fixations on certain things. My grandson went thru a period of ponies. He could not have just one pony, he had to have all kinds. If one got lost, OMG! Meltdown until we found it. He can tell you anything you want to know about horses and doesnt much care if you dont want to hear it. You will hear it. All of it, like it or not you will listen until he is done telling you lol. He also cannot thro a ball or catch one. He can ride a bike but is very clumsy with it. He speaks loudly and matter of factly.  He shows no excitement recieving christmas gifts, has no particular wants and noise, specifically music and crowds will bring about a meltdown. He is academically above his peers but in a social setting he is awkward. He has just been diagnosed with aspergers and is 7. Up till now we have had different diagnosis like auditory processing disorder, language disorder, adhd. From what I understand this is fairly common to do this as the child will eventually make the diagnosis clear as they exhibit clearer symptoms the older they get. We are grateful for a diagnosis but fear that at some point this will change into something worse, as he gets older.

        No problem. I see how you feel. I would probably feel the same way. I always feel like I don't do anything right. But I so can relate to your social problems. I am the same way. I mean about the social part. Do you ever get embarrassed when people correct you or tell you that your not saying the right thing? I know I do. Just the other day I was in the docs office chatting with Mom and she told me I was talking to loud but I didn't think I was loud at all. Anyway I bet it's hard to deal with autism. I actually read a lot about it because I notice that there are a lot of symptoms that applys to me since I was little. I mean I don't know for sure or anything but I do have many symptoms of it. Oh today I had a social experiance and I was a total wreck.

597,My nephew will be four in a month and won't poop in toilet,"
        So a long story short, I have a 2 1/2 year old that seems like he is like your nephew. I posted in another forum but I thought I would ask you if your nephew has any of these issues listed below. I have made a list of tha majority or things that my son does hoping to get some insight but I haven't found it yet (sad thing is it has been over 1 1/2 since we started looking). Anyway if you wouldn't mind take a look and see if your nephew fits these:

•Doesn’t always seem to acknowledge when someone is right next to him. 
•Only responds to his name when called about 10%-15% of the time. 
•He has a speech delay that we noticed early on. He only had a few words by 18 months, started using 2 word sentences after 2 years of age, he is missing the ends of most words (i.e. eyes is eye, juice is jui, nose is go, hat is ha) 
•He had surgery for being tongue tied in June 2009. 
•He doesn’t understand personal space 
•He has very little eye contact. 
•Will pull people around but refuse to tell them what he wants. 
•Hits (with hands and toys), bites, pulls hair, scratches, chokes, pushes. He doesn’t seem to understand that he is hurting the person or animal. 
•He throws toysand uses them to hit people or bangs them on other toys or objects (windows, walls, doors, TV, etc…) 
•Has frequent tantrums,They last anywhere from 5 seconds to over an hour. 
•He will take food directly off of someone else’s plate or directly out of their hand and eat it. 
•Will push people out of where they are sitting so he can sit there. 
•He is constantly taking toys away from others. 
•Constantly turning on/off light switches, closing doors that are open, pulling the cushions of the couch, etc… 
•Climbs excessively on furniture 
•Constantly pulls the wood trim off the walls. 
•He needs constant supervision. 
•He doesn’t seem to understand consequence therefore discipline is ineffective. He doesn’t learn that he cannot do certain things and that we will get punished for them. It is as if he is compelled to do these behaviors. It seems like he just cannot stop himself from doing them. 
•He insists on turning things on. Switches for things such as the baby swing, the TV, the Xbox, lights, anything of that nature. 
•Climbs over gates making it impossible to childproof areas that are impossible to childproof (i.e. the kitchen). 
•Will move TV and climb behind it. Unplugs wires going into the TV and tries to plug them back in. 
•TV stand doors are childproofed but he still manages to squeeze his hand in there and pull things out. 
•Will take a sip from his Sippy cup then spit the drink on the floor or into toys and proceed to play with it. 
•He is very destructive but I do not believe that he is trying to be. 
•He is still putting everything in his mouth. He either just chews them or he will eat them (i.e. PlayDoh, board books, wooden puzzles, stickers, anything that is small enough to fit in his mouth) 
•He will run in circles for no apparent reason. This is not spinning, it is bigger circles. Although on occasion we gave noticed him spinning around. 
•For the most part he will refuse to get in his car seat with his jacket or shoes on. He will start screaming and will not stop. There are also times when he will not have his shoes or jacket on and will scream. These times I cannot figure out what the problem is. 
•He seems to have a high tolerance for pain. He usually only cries when he is already mad at something. Otherwise if he hurts himself he usually laughs or just ignores it. 
•He seems to have imaginative play that is being mimicked. For instance he will play with a baby doll by feeding it and then burping it. This is what he has seen his sister do many times. He does not however talk to the baby or pretend as if he is the parent. He doesn’t seem to bring his own ideas into the play. He seems to only do things that we know others have shown him. 
•He doesn’t usually play with toys the way they are supposed to be played with. For instance, we have a video of him playing with his sister’s vacuum. He spent 20 minutes playing with the different parts of the vacuum, examining them, turning it upside down and playing with the wheels and putting the hose part in his mouth.  This whole time he never used it as a vacuum. We have notice that with trucks he mostly pushes them around while running behind them. Rarely will he ever make any sounds that a vehicle will make. If he does it is usually “Vroom, vroom, beep, beep.” This is what we say. 
•His hands seem to be awkward. He holds a crayon like he is making a fist. I can’t describe the awkwardness but it is as if he is not comfortable using his hands. I believe that all other areas of motor development are fine. 
•Hates to have himself washed and his hair washed. He loves playing in the tub though. 
•He is very difficult with teeth brushing. He refuses to let you help him and if he does it himself he just wets the toothbrush and ***** the water off and then repeats. 
•He will get mad if Noggin/Nick Jr is turned off or changed even if he is not watching it. 
•He will overstuff his mouth with food. Sometimes he will spit it out and the put it back in his mouth and eat it. 
•Forces himself onto people. He tries to sit on someone’s lap and is forceful. He gets mad if you don’t let him. 
•When we leave the house he needs to be wearing a backpack harness or in a stroller because he takes off with no regard for safety. This is even the case if we are just going outside to play. 
•He will want to put his shoes, gloves, jacket, hat, etc on but once you put them on he gets mad and takes them off. Then he wants them back on again and the process is repeated. 
•Pushes people to take things from him. If he wants me to take his toy for example he will force it into my hand. If I take it and put it down he will pick it up again and give it back to me. 
•He will bring toys or a book over to you and then walk away.There are not many occasions where he brings a book over and wants you to read it. Most of the time he will not sit for a story. It seems as if he thinks it’s a good idea and then when you start reading he gets up, takes the book and walks away. I have noticed that most of the time that he brings me a book it is just after his sister has brought me one to read to her.

599,My son just turned 3 and is still not talking much.,"
        It seems like you’re doing the right things. Autism spectrum disorders are characterized by language and communication delays along with patterns of repetitive behavior. The criteria for diagnosis are behavioral and it’s not uncommon for differing diagnosticians to give different diagnoses. I would recommend continuing to look into whether or not an autism diagnosis is appropriate for your son. Additionally, though, I would absolutely recommend aggressively pursuing additional speech and language services for him. Regardless of the diagnosis, early intervention of this sort can be enormously helpful and the more hours of services you can get for him, the more he will benefit.

600,Possible declining speech - other habits,"
        First of all, the fact that your son is only nine-months-old means that there is a great deal of range in what might be considered within normal limits for typical development.  The range of what might be considered typical can make it very difficult to determine if there are developmental problems.  I understand your concern if he was using “mama” and “dada” and now no longer is using these words.  On the other hand, if he was saying the words, but not necessarily using them in a consistent manner (i.e., to “label you or his father), then they may have been a form of babbling (which would be quite typical at his age).  Something like banging his hands on a highchair tray is something that any nine-month-old might do.  What may be important here is a description of the qualitative nature of what you are observing (i.e., does it look like your son is “tuning you out” when you try to get him look at you or say “mama”).  I encourage you to take your son to your pediatrician and discuss your concerns with him or her.  The pediatrician may suggest that you wait until your son’s next check up, or he or she may refer you to a local Early Intervention Program (EIP) for screening.  Given your son’s age, I would not be surprised if the recommendation is to wait, however, I always advise parents that if the recommendation is to wait, and you notice any decrease in your child’s development, you contact the pediatrician at that time and not wait.  In the meantime you may wish to take a look at the websites below.  They have information about early identification of children with ASD and general child development.

601,Possible declining speech - other habits,"
        Hello, My name is Melanie, and our 3yr old son was diagnosed with autism right before he turned 2. I suggest you take your son to a neurologist and a pediatric specialist who might be able to diagnose him if anything is wrong..being he is young, it might be hard to tell yet.  But EI (early intervention) is great but as you may know it must be done before he is 3yrs old.  I'm hoping that your son is completely fine, and doing typical behavior at his age.  But if he does happen to be on the autism spectrum then I seriously suggest you treat him with RDI (relationship development intervention).  I try to pass this on to as many families as i can, as this seems to be the best for autistic children.  You can see if there are any special instruction teachers in EI who specialize in autism and RDI.  Any other doctor or SI teacher will probably tell you to do ABA or VBA..which trains your child like a robot,and will teach them skills..but do NOT help with autism, on the contrary it will only push them further toward the autism path rather than away from it.  Unfortunatly RDI is not well known, so that is why you will be told to do speech, ABA, VBA..etc, because that is all they know.  Trust me on this.  Our son has almost fully recovered from autism with the use of RDI.

        Thank you Melanie. I truly appreciate your comments and insight. It is wonderful to hear from families that have been successful in working with autism.  I truly hope we don't have to  worry about that with my son - but it is comforting that so many more resources are available today.

603,4 year old son Andrew,"
        First, why is the school not evaluating him in a timely manner? If you live the USA, at least in California, they have 60 days (I think / please double check) to do their job.  If he is delayed in speech and social skills, he should already be in speech therapy and social skills classes.  If he has any form of PDD or autism, the earlier you start him with intervention classes and therapies, the better he is going to do long run.  So, you need to be your son's advocate and push the School District to evaluate him soon and provide the services that this child needs, assuming you can not afford to provide them on your own for a lack of insurance.  In California, K begins when the child turns 5 by December of the year that he or she starts K.  Even with normal boys, where I live, most moms hold their boys back one year if they are born after June 1.  So, I think that you probably should hold him back and get him into the therapies that he needs.  You need to be his advocate and ask / push for the help that he needs. If you hold him back one year and he still has to go into a special ed class, that is not the end of the world.  He will get the help that he needs in special ed.   You do not want him in a regular class if he does not belong there because he will be frustrated if he can not keep up with his peers or the teacher's instructions. Good luck.

604,4 year old son Andrew,"
        Oh my..I am reading about your 4yr old boy Andrew, and this is the same thing we went through with our son  Andrew who is now 31/2.  He was born typical and healthy, almost advanced. He was almost 2 when he got his MMR shot, and everything went downhill from there.  He stopped talking, making eye contact, started lining things up like blocks or cars ( long lines ) and hardly ever responded to his name anymore.  He also would make strange noises when playing on his own, and if we had our young cousins or his friends over he acted as if they were invisible.  We were devestated to learn from a pediatric specialist that he was indeed on the autism spectrum diagnosed with PDD.  Of course he recommended ABA, and VBA which we definitly did not do..and we had him evaluated with early intervention and he got that for a yr. since he was 2..and now he goes to a special preschool.  The preschools for special needs are okay..but will not help him if he is autistic...so what we are also doing is RDI on the side which we pay for (not very expensive).  When Andrew was in EI his special intruction teacher happened to specialize in autism and RDI..and we learned sooooo much from her, and I will pass this on to as many families as I can.  RDI is relationship development intervention and seems to me to be the only option that can greatly improve and in most cases help children recover from autism.  The schools will teach him skills, help him go to the potty, etc, but it will not help his autism.  Basically the only thing my son gets out of preschool is he goes to the potty now, and loves the guy who comes in with his guitar and sings, and likes to play with the children..but the social interaction piece was gained back with our work at home and using RDI.  I don't know if your son will still line things up, or get mad if you move them..but if so you know in autism other things come with that like ocd.  RDI will also help with that, we were constantly changing things up because autistic children are afraid of the unknown, and don't know what people expect of them and therefore only want things the way they want them, and usually has to have it the same way all of the time.

605,Could this be symptom of autism?,"
        
First and foremost, if you have concerns about your daughter’s development, I strongly recommend that you speak with your daughter’s pediatrician.  Pediatricians are usually the first contact point for accessing additional assessments (if needed) and services.  

One comment: when she screams louder when you “go against her”, does it is usually or even occasionally result in people “backing off” going against her?  This does not necessarily mean that she is or is not on the spectrum only that it is possible that some inappropriate patterns of behaving are developing (which can happen with any child).  You may want to speak with your pediatrician about this to see is he or she has any recommendations for help with child rearing books or services.  

Regarding autism, meantime you may wish to take a look at the websites below.  They have information about early identification of children with ASD and general child development.  I also included a couple of websites that might help you find information about child rearing (you may have to search links connected to eth sites).  I hope these are helpful.

607,Pointing,"
        Since you mention that you have already administered an MCHAT, and you are using terms like “Declarative pointing”, it is obvious that you have already looked at least some of the websites that I recommend for parents concerned about their child’s development.  Overall, it sounds like your son is developing within the normal range.  My standard recommendation is to speak with your son’s pediatrician about your concerns (which I am sure you will at the 18 month checkup).  The pediatrician may suggest that you wait until your son’s next check up or refer you to a local Early Intervention Program (EIP) for screening or possibly to another specialist.   (Of course, if the recommendation is to wait, I strongly recommend that if you notice any decrease in your son’s development you contact the pediatrician at that time and not wait.)  I included a few websites below where you might find some helpful information about child development and early identification of children with ASD.

As far as directly working on pointing, I suggest that you continue to provide your son with lots of activities and attention to these early communication behaviors.  It is not unusual for children to develop pointing (and other verbal behavior) that function to obtain desired items prior to “commenting” by pointing.  Both behaviors are, of course, very important.  If you want to try and tailor some activities that might set the occasion for your son to point as a means to “share” some event, you might look into activities that are used to assess and promote joint attention with children.  For example, having something that you know your son really likes suddenly “appear” in the area you are in (but out of his reach) might provide an opportunity to work on these behaviors.  Some of the teaching techniques used to increase these behaviors referred to as response shaping and incidental teaching.  At your son’s age and skill level that you describe, at least for the time being, I would keep things fairly low key.  An understanding of how to use the above techniques and positive reinforcement is very helpful, but I recommend using these techniques in sort of “everyday play” situations with you son.

608,soiling can any1 help,"
        It sounds like you’re saying that your son is toilet trained but began having accidents relatively recently. You’re doing the right thing to have him checked out to make sure that there is no medical problem. If it isn’t caused by a medical issue, it’s something that can be treated behaviorally. The first thing to consider is that you want to make sure that he’s not doing it because of the reaction that he gets from you. When he has an accident, clean him up and get him dressed with as little production as possible. In addition, if it’s a continuing problem, scheduling times for him to sit on the toilet regularly can be a good idea. I would also recommend arranging special reinforcement for him if he is able to go the entire day with no accidents. Pick something that’s a really big deal for him, explain the contingency, and have him help you keep track of how well he’s doing.

609,Other approaches apart from phonics,"
        There is no single approach that works with everyone. The best approach is to identify a most effective teaching method based in the skills and strengths of the individual being taught. Are your son’s teachers seeing him struggle as well? There is no justification for continuing to press forward with an ineffective teaching strategy, particularly when there is one that your son has already had success with. There are speech pathologists and behavior analysts with training on establishing verbal behavior that have experience working with children like your son. I would recommend seeking these professionals out and pursuing additional reading therapy for your son. If you find a therapist you like, have that person come in to meet with your son’s teachers. If you believe that your son learns better using a different approach, your next step should be to gather the data that make your point and a professional with experience teaching reading to individuals diagnosed with ASDs should be able to help.

610,Asperger's learned responses,"
        Unfortunately, without information as to why he is engaging in this aggressive behavior, it is difficult to determine how to effectively reduce the behavior. In addition, I’m reluctant to give any advice about trying to help change his behavior, as it sounds like his behavior his quite severe and it’s not unusual for changes in programs to result in at least initial increases in behavior severity or frequency. 

In the case of severe or dangerous problem behavior, it is best to try and get help from a professional who has experience in assessment and intervention.  I would recommend that you contact a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) in your area and try to access services for this young man.  The BACB website has a local service provider directory at:http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html

        Or the aggressive behaviour may be being used as a way of getting the desired outcome he needs ie. being secluded away from whatever the issue was.  If he does not have the insight or skills to be able to identify stress triggers and know what to do to self calm or remove himself from the situation etc and reduce anxiety and stress, then his only 'learnt' option that works for him is being arrested and put in jail.

615,Help! My autistic son is becoming very aggressive!,"
        Unfortunately, without information as to why he is engaging in this aggressive behavior, it is difficult to determine how to effectively reduce the behavior. Medications can, in some cases, help reduce problem behavior; however, each individual’s case is different and no one medication is helpful for everybody.

If your son is still receiving special education services (in many states, special education services cover a young person until they are 22 years of age), you could ask the school if they have a Behavior Analyst on their staff who might be able to help you address his behavior. If your son is not still in the school system, but receives services from a different state agency (e.g., Medicaid), you may be able to access the services of a behavior analyst funded by that state agency – in this case, I’d suggest that you contact his case worker, explain your situation, and ask what your options are.  
If you are interested in paying for and locating a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) in your area, the BACB website has a local service provider directory at:http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html

617,services for autistic-like behaviors different from adhd,"
        I am not sure if you are speaking as a parent or educational professional, but in either case my primary recommendation is to try and locate a neurologist or neuropsychologist to help understand the test results you have already and possibly to conduct additional assessments to help clarify the child’s learning problems.  Particularly in light of the range of subtest scores you list, I would recommend someone who has extensive experience with children with “unusual” assessment profiles.  Individuals with wide variation on subtest score often have social and communication problems due to the discrepancies in “understanding” the world around them (often the problems are based in failures to discriminate various contingences that impact on social behavior, or deficiencies in behavior repertoires to respond appropriately).  Also, since it is clear that you have been given some information on an underlying genetic cause for some of the child’s problems, I suggest you follow up on this.  You may want to contact a clinic at a pediatric teaching hospital that specializes in seeing children with genetically-based disorders (you didn’t mention an age, but since he or she has already had had IQ assessments , he or she must be over three-years-old, but still school aged).  Finally, although I am suggesting some additional assessments, the main emphasis should be taking the information you receive and working with your educational professional to find the best placement for the child.  This usually means supports that are geared to the child’s needs, and include behavior management as well as traditional educational input.

618,peeing when he gets out of the bath,"
        I presume that you have already done so, but you might want to take him to see the pediatrician to rule out any possible medical issues. Although it sounds like more of a mild behavior problem, it’s always best to rule out a medical cause when dealing with incontinence.

Without having an idea of why he’s doing this, it can be tough to make suggestions about how to make him stop.  However, it sounds as though he finds something about the situation funny, so you might try using that to your advantage. Although he might be a little bit big for it, you could put down a potty seat next to the tub, so that as soon as you pull him out, he gets put right onto the potty seat.  If he does urinate in the seat, then provide lots of immediate praise (and maybe a treat). At the same time, provide minimal attention (totally ignore it if you can) to any attempts to urinate outside of the toilet – it may be that whatever attention he is getting from you may be slightly reinforcing as well.  It doesn’t sound as though the time-outs are terribly effective, so you might consider discontinuing them while you are trying some other strategies.  Finally, don’t give up if this doesn’t work immediately – it may take several attempts across several days before you see success. 

If you are interested in further pursuing toilet training, there are several books available that provide step-by-step advice on toilet training in developmentally disabled populations (“Toilet training in less than a Day” by Nate Azrin and Richard Foxx is one example) that may provide some useful tips.  

Best of luck to you all.

619,Should I be concerned about my 7 month old?,"
        There is an increased risk of Autism Spectrum Disorders in siblings of individuals with the disorder, but I wouldn’t worry deeply about a change in behavior that has only lasted a few days – especially if other aspects of her development have seemed fairly normal up until now.  It sounds as though she is on track, as babbling tends to begin around 6 or 7 months. However, if you don’t see her begin babbling again within a few weeks, I would encourage you to share your concerns with your pediatrician, who can help you decide whether your concern is warranted. In the meanwhile, keep in mind that there is a wide range in the “normal” timelines of development.

620,sensory play/stimming?,"
        Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including Autism, Aspergers, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests.  Your description of him suggests that he has fairly normal social and communication skills, so that makes it less likely that an Autism Spectrum diagnosis is a good fit.  Engaging in stereotypy (AKA “self-stimulation” or “stimming”) does not mean that your child will end up with a diagnosis of developmental delay – plenty of typically-developing infants and children engage in forms of stereotypy.  In fact, many adults engage in forms of stereotypy as well: look at a high school classroom and see how many people are staring into the distance while tapping their pencil on their desk!

It sounds as though your son takes instructions and feedback well – this might be an indication that you could work with him on when it’s not okay to twirl/wiggle pencils (e.g., when there is some task he should be working on) and when it is okay (e.g., when the students have down time, after he finishes his worksheet, etc.).  It may be as easy as having a card on his desk with a  red “stop” sign during work times (signaling that he shouldn’t play with his pencil at that time), that he or the teacher can flip over to a green “okay” side when work is finished.  If the behavior persists despite intervention, you might ask if his school has a behavior analyst on their staff who might be able to provide more specific help.
Good luck

621,Could my boyfriends son be autistic?,"
        Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including Autism, Aspergers, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests. Based on your description, it’s hard to know which, if any, diagnosis fits, and direct (in-person) evaluation by a qualified professional is necessary for any diagnosis. If you haven’t already brought this to the attention of your pediatrician, I’d recommend doing so now, so s/he can help you decide whether he would benefit from further evaluation.  
Regardless of his diagnosis, childhood behavior problems like temper tantrums can typically be addressed through consultation with a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA).  If you feel that the behavior is stigmatizing or interfering with more adaptive behaviors, you may want to consult with a BCBA.  This professional will want to spend time directly observing your child as well as interviewing your family, so that they can provide recommendations on how to best address the issue. A local BCBA can be found at the following site: http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html.

622,delayed? autism? or ok? i dont know anymore,"
        Although your son has shown signs of motor delays, it sounds like he is receiving early intervention services and has made some progress, which is great. However, the social difficulties that you describe (his problem behavior when individuals try to get close to him) are concerning and are consistent with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Therefore, I recommend that you seek the assistance of an individual who specializes in the diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorders so you can get an accurate diagnosis for your son. A diagnosis will allow you to identify appropriate services and supports. However, diagnosis alone does not suggest an appropriate intervention. Therefore, my recommendation is for you to work with school personnel on a plan to improve your son’s social skills and to decrease problem behavior. I recommend that you seek the support of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, who would be able to conduct the appropriate assessments and to assist in developing a behavior plan. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers.

624,Are these autistic symptoms?,"
        Although one of the diagnostic criteria for an Autism Spectrum Disorder is stereotyped patterns of behavior similar to your son’s flapping, tapping, and clapping, there are a number of other criteria that need to be present to receive this diagnosis. In addition to stereotyped and repetitive motor movements, individuals with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder usually exhibit more than one form of impairment in social interaction (e.g., limited eye contact, lack of social initiations or interest in others). In addition, the impairment in social interaction and repetitive motor stereotypy limits the individual’s overall functioning. From your description, it sounds like your son may not meet all of the diagnostic criteria to receive a diagnosis. However, to determine the cause of his lack of pointing and repetitive clapping/tapping/licking and to receive services to treat this problem, I recommend that you seek the assistance of a qualified professional who specializes in the diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorders. This is the only way to definitely determine whether or not your son has a diagnosis of Asperger’s Disorder or a related disorder, and more importantly, it will allow you to identify appropriate services for your son. I also recommend that you seek the support of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, who would be able to conduct an assessment and determine an effective intervention for decreasing your son’s problem behavior.

627,my 29 months old boy cant communicate perfectly,"
        There is a wide range of individual differences with respect to the emergence of speech. Speech begins with single word utterances and then progresses as from single word to two word utterances until larger number of words are strung together. Speech also takes different forms, with some forms serving the purpose of labeling different objects in the environment which often results in social praise from a caregiver, whereas other forms of speech serve the purpose of requesting items and results in access to those items. From your description, it is difficult to tell whether or not your son has a speech delay. Because of the discrepancy among individuals within the normal range of speech development, emergence that is slower than that observed for his sister does not necessarily mean he has a delay. I recommend that you discuss your concerns with your son's pediatrician, who will most likely refer you to have your son assessed by early intervention specialist who can determine whether or not your son's speech development is delayed. In addition, your pediatrician can refer your son to have his hearing checked to make sure that his speech issues are not related to difficulties with his hearing.

628,Sexual Fantasies of 10 year old PDD/NOS Boy,"
        It’s really great that your son is able to talk to you about these things. Learning about sexuality is something that takes place for all humans regardless of whether or not they have been diagnosed with a developmental disability and sexual education is just as important for a person diagnosed with autism as it is for someone who isn’t. It sounds like your son isn’t violent and I would guess that your read on this is correct, that he’s just beginning to come to experience his sexuality and that he hasn’t learned other ways to interpret what he’s feeling. Since your son is able to talk to you about this, I would recommend treating it as you would with a typically developing child and beginning early sex education now. Resources for introduction to sexual education exist and I would recommend that you look into them and find something that you believe might benefit your son.

The aggression and other problem behavior is treatable and there is no reason why significant gains cannot be made.

The fact that he responds so well to music & had difficulty with math makes it seem to be left hemisphere related.  I would get him to as many top medical facilities as possible, those with a state of the art neurology group.  I don't know what state you're in, but you should (even with the budget cuts) be able to receive disability for him, which would allow you to bring some caregivers into the home.  Blessings to you.

        Without knowing your son, it’s impossible for me to tell exactly what is going on. Is he verbal and able to accurately report pain or discomfort? If not, I would definitely pursue looking into any possible medical causes or issues that he might not be able to report to you. Emotionality is not uncommon in teenagers both with and without autism-spectrum diagnoses. If there seems to be no medical cause for his crying, I would recommend having him seen by a psychiatrist who has experience working with children like your son. The psychiatrist should be able to help you identify whether the crying is within a normal range or if your son might be suffering from a form of depression.

        Autism and Asperger’s Disorders are characterized by a similar set of characteristics, most notably deficits in social interaction skills, communication skills, and highly stereotyped behaviors (e.g., repetitive motor or vocal behaviors that don’t seem to serve any function) or interests (topics of conversation or activity are highly restricted or narrow).  The major difference among the disorders is in language development: in Asperger’s Disorder, there is no delay in early language development. In Autism, there is some delay in language acquisition.  Also, delays (in language or social development) must be noted to occur prior to age 3 for a diagnosis of Autism.

        Trish,
I have been a mother to a child with Asperger's, or High Functioning Autism, for almost 12 years now. Dealing with the quirkinesses can be difficult but very enlightening at the same time. At an early age, my son Bryan, didn't talk very much, but was obviously very bright. He was doing complex puzzles and structures by the age of 3. While every parent wants to have a genius for a child, the price is almost too high. When he would work on his puzzles or structures, the rest of the world would simply disappear. At first I was worried that he was going deaf, because I would call him and he didn't even respond. Potty training was insane, it took forever! He would get into his ""zone"" and he would wet/potty himself, forget to eat, etc...the rest of the world just went away in his eyes. His temper tantrums were enormous and I tried to follow the doctor's suggestions, but found the only way to stop them was - you're going to laugh - but to hug him. He hated to be held, touched, kissed, unless it was on his terms. That alone was very difficult. The hardest part was when he was older. I would get calls regarding my son that didn't sound anything like him! ""Are you sure you are talking about Bryan? Cute, quiet, never bothers anyone?"" Finally, in Kindergarten a teacher suggested I have my son tested, and the ""A"" word came into my world. Since that diagnosis, I have fought the school, doctors, medical professionals in regards to my son and his well being. Autism is such a new disorder that everything is still up in the air, and as a mother of an autistic child it can be very upsetting. There are no definite answers for the millions of questions you have, which leaves you frustrated and struggling for help. You will get tons of suggestions, but no definites. We have gone through a battery of tests, psychologists, neuologists, and therapy sessions. He was given an IQ test earlier this year and was shown to have a 132 non-verbal, and an 82 verbal. Bryan doesn't have any friends, stems (flaps his hands, makes gunting noises, and bounces about when irritated, excited, or over stimulated) fairly consistantly, has a modified achidemic schedule, but is in a normal classroom. He just got his progress report card and is getting straight A's. He has gotten better about talking to people and engaging in eye-to-eye contact, but he is picked on a lot by the other kids. He rides the bus, goes to public school, loves dinosaurs and chickens, and wants to be a farmer when he grows up. His refuge is his home, his family. While it sounds like a very difficult world to live in, it really isn't. It's just different. Bryan has opened my eyes to so many new things around me, ways of looking at them, dealing with them, understanding them. His passion for Life is inspiring. His laugh still brings tears of joy to my eyes. Bryan is not like other 12 year olds....but that is okay.

        Since your question is “…what should we do?” here’s what I would do (and these things should be all done as soon as possible):  speak with the appropriate person at the school (start with your son’s teacher; and he or she may refer you to a school psychologist, social worker or special needs department).  Explain that you want your son to receive a screening for any special education needs and, if there are any indicators of specific areas of difficulty, a full CORE Evaluation.  After you speak with the school personnel, put down in a letter to the school what you discussed (when you met, your request for an assessment etc.).   Let me add that I mention putting your request in writing in order to help keep things clear for you and the school and to document the request.  I want to emphasize that I have often spoken with parents who seem to develop an adversarial relationship with their school system before there has been a chance for the school to address the parents’ concerns.  I think speaking with the appropriate personnel at the school before requesting anything in writing helps to keep everyone working together as a team.  The until such time as the school gives you a reason to believe that they are not acting in your child’s best interest, assume they are following through on their mandate to provide your child with an appropriate education.  At the same time as meeting with your school, talk to your child’s pediatrician and ask about a referral to a pediatric neurologist.  I suggest this based on the history that you have provided.  I will also add that I am not sure what doctor you saw that used the checklists alone as a basis for concluding that there was nothing wrong with your son.  Checklists are commonly used in diagnosis of ADHD, but they are only one part of a comprehensive assessment.

        What you are describing isn’t uncommon in typically developing 2-yr olds and there can be quite a range in development across a range of areas. Also, tantruming and other sorts of problem behavior may be more likely if your son isn’t yet able to communicate effectively given the speech delay. All that being said, having him assessed for autism-spectrum disorders would be a good idea. In any case, absolutely pursue early intervention for any and all delays whether they be motor or speech. Even if he does not receive a diagnosis, the extra therapy can be enormously helpful. Regardless of diagnosis, if he’s delayed in some areas, he could use the extra help. So, do your best to make sure he gets it.

641,Asperger's?,"
        I can't comment about the delays but I have a 2 year old also.  The rapid mood swings are typical of what I saw in both my boys and in other normal 2 year old children we play with.  The question is does he have the behavior problems (biting hitting etc) in all situations or is he normally better with someone in particular.  I've discovered my 2 year old never hits or bites at preschool but at home he feels its a way to get my attention when I'm working with my other child or he does it when he doesn't get his way with his brother.  

I hope that helps a bit.

     I just wanted to send you a not of encouragement. 
I have a son who is now 17. We were told  several years ago that he has Asperger's. After alot of testing and learning. I now have a well behaved  straight A student. I feel it is important however that the child have a big part in his development. His school has a class to help him learn how to handel social situations also. This has also been a blessing.  My son, I am pround to say, is in the process of writing a book and is a star singer in the school choir.  Once you learn how they think and learn how to talk to them, they become just as normal as any other child. Have faith and hang in there. There is hope and you can have a ""normal"" child in time.

Hope this helps you to know it will be okay. It is hard work, don't get me wrong, but very much worth it.

        I was on tenex for years when I was younger, for ADD. 

Tenex is a high blood pressure med that can also be used for these sorts of things.

Missing doses can be very bad for your health - your blood pressure will sky rocket.

Also in some cases, it can cause heart problems down the road for people who have taken it.

645,Autism and Social Anxiety Issues,"
        Given the problem behavior you describe, I recommend that you seek the support of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, who would be able to conduct the appropriate assessments and to assist in developing an assessment and treatment plan for these behaviors. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers. Although early intervention services can be helpful for increasing appropriate behavior and decreasing problem behavior among young children, there is no empirical evidence supporting the use of a weighted vest as a form of treatment for problem behavior among individuals with autism. Although it sounds likely that your son may receive an autism diagnosis, it may be helpful for you to seek the assistance of a qualified professional who specializes in the diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorders so that you can receive an accurate diagnosis for your son. Although diagnosis alone will not point to an appropriate intervention, it will lead you to identify appropriate services for your son. I recommend that you seek the assistance of a pediatric psychiatrist who can systematically evaluate the effects of the Zoloft on your son’s problem behavior. If the medicine is consistently causing an increase in his problem behavior, then it does not sound like this medicine should remain in effect. However, a pediatric psychiatrist should be able to evaluate the effects of this medicine and inform you if this medication should be discontinued an alternate medicine prescribed. Regarding your question about whether Autism and Social Anxiety Disorder are linked, one of the characteristics of individuals diagnosed with autism is an impairment in social interaction (e.g., limited eye contact, lack of social initiations or interest in others). In addition, individuals with autism often engage in repetitive nonfunctional behavior (e.g., motor stereotypy) that may be socially stigmatizing. However, social anxiety disorder is not listed as a defining feature of autism.

646,Teen Daughter,"
        Many people start by discussing the issue with their pediatrician who can refer to someone with experience making those diagnoses. Keep in mind that the sort of difficulties that you describe are not uncommon in teens that have no diagnosis and the diagnosis isn’t necessary for you and your daughter to be working on them. I would recommend finding a therapist that you and your daughter are comfortable with and addressing the difficulties that she’s having head on. Going off to college and being successful on your own for the first time actually requires a fairly complex skill set. No reason not to start planning for and working on that now.

647,MY SISTER NEEDS HELP!!!!,"
        This is obviously a very intense and stressful situation. Based on the information you provide, I can’t tell if an autism-spectrum disorder diagnosis might be appropriate for your nephew but having him assessed might provide useful information. Typically developing 3-yr olds can display the sort of tantrums and problem behavior that you’re describing, so while he might meet the criteria for a diagnosis, he might not as well. In any case, dealing with that sort of behavior can be very difficult especially if your sister has a number of other children to care for. I would highly recommend seeking out a board certified behavior analyst in your area who has experience working with children like your nephew. These sorts of behavior problems are treatable and there are professionals who should be able to help your sister work on a plan for how to handle them.

648,violent seizures,"
        The first thing to do is to get the seizures under control. If he is taking medicine for them, and it’s not working, the medication needs to be adjusted. You should be working closely with a doctor to treat the seizures and making changes until you’re seeing improvement. It’s not clear if he has been diagnosed with a particular disorder. If his behavior has changed as dramatically as you seem to indicate, you should be aggressively pursuing having him assessed and accessing additional services to help him. It sounds like he and your family clearly need help and continuing to have him assessed until a cause is found is the first step.

649,Pulling and eating hair,"
        
Although not very common, this behavior is not as rare as you may think.  It is also not the kind of behavior that I could say to you “Do x …” and the behavior will disappear.  There are number of more detailed questions that a qualified behavior analyst working directly with you needs to ask about the behavior.  There are a number or interventions that can successfully address the behavior, but a specific assessment of the conditions surrounding the behavior is the first step.  I suggest that you find a qualified behavior analyst to help you with the problem behavior.  In addition, given the increasing number of findings that early intensive intervention based on the principles of applied behavior analysis is the most effective treatment for children with ASD, it is clearly in Madeline’s best interest to find a qualified behavior analyst to (at a minimum) help monitor her progress. 

Here are a couple of websites that might be helpful in locating a behavior analyst (they also have information about what ABA and the use of the techniques with children with ASDs):

Also, in case anyone mentions the term “trichotillomania”, don’t be alarmed (or impressed).  This is the specific psychiatric term for what your daughter is doing.  As a shorthand description of the behavior it’s fine, but the concept of the behavior as some psychological or emotional disorder won’t lead to any useful treatment intervention.

        No one can diagnose your son over the internet.  I certainly see why you are concerned and if you can do anything to shorten the time before he will be seen by his doctor, you should do it.  (I am assuming the pediatrician you were referred to is a specialist in children with possible developmental problems.)  I included below a list of websites that I often give to people who have questions about autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).   I am afraid that the bottom line is that you will have to persevere looking into the resources available in your local community.  If you can’t find any, then you will need to continue to push to see where the nearest services are that are appropriate for your son.

Speak with the neurologist who gave your son the diagnosis, and 2. Get a second opinion from a neurologist, neuro-psychologist, or other health professional familiar with children with autism spectrum disorders.  #1 allows you to ask the neurologist directly how he arrived at his diagnosis for your son, and discuss any concerns you have.  #2 would give you the opportunity to explain to the clinician giving the second opinion that you want to be sure that the clinician bases his or her diagnosis on direct observation as well as whatever descriptive assessment tools they might use.  I always stress to parents that finding a clinician who has seen many children with ASDs is very important.

        Given your niece’s early history there may be a number of factors contributing to the behaviors you describe.  The one thing that is certain is that you should definitely pursue having a full assessment of her development.  The typical place to start is with your niece’s pediatrician.  After you describe the above behaviors to him or her, they should make a referral to your local educational authority (usually the school department of the town where you live) and they will do a full educational assessment.  You pediatrician may also recommend some additional medical and neuropsychological assessments.  In the USA, every child at age three may receive educational services from their local educational authority if they are identified as having some special need.  I encourage you to pursue help for your niece as soon as possible.  The earlier she receives any help that she needs to better for everyone concerned.

664,Stereotypic behavior/stimming in SPD,"
        Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including Autism, Aspergers, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests.  Based on your description, it doesn’t sound as though you have concerns with her social development, and there is a reasonable account for language delays (a bilingual household).  However, direct (in-personal) evaluation by a qualified professional is necessary for any diagnosis.  If you haven’t already brought this to the attention of your pediatrician, I’d recommend doing so now. Be sure to discuss both the behaviors that you are concerned about (“stimming” is more formally referred to as “stereotypy” in the literature), as well as developmental milestones that she is (or is not) meeting.  As to your main question: Engaging in stereotypy does not mean that your child will end up with a diagnosis of developmental delay or an Autism spectrum disorder– plenty of typically-developing infants and children engage in forms of stereotypy.

Regardless of her diagnosis, childhood behavior problems like stereotypy can typically be addressed through consultation with a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA).  If you feel that the behavior is stigmatizing or interfering with more adaptive behaviors, you may want to consult with a BCBA.  This professional will want to spend time directly observing your child as well as interviewing your family, so that they can provide recommendations on how to best address the issue. A local BCBA can be found at the following site: http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html

671,worried about autism,"
        
I think that it is understandable that you are concerned, but it also sounds like you are closely monitoring your son’s developmental progression and have the correct people involved.  Parents have reported that some children were developing completely normally until a sudden loss in language and social skills at ages varying from two to three years.  This is just one of the controversial topics in children diagnosed with ASDs.  It seems more likely that children who eventually go on to be diagnosed with an ASD were showing signs of delayed and/or disordered development in social and communication skills, but these were not noticed until they reached some “threshold” where a caregiver or professional noted them.  As far as stereotyped behaviors (often referred to a “stimming” or “self stimulation”), everybody engages in these behaviors.  It is often a matter of how often, how intensely, where, what it is and at what age that determines whether it would indicate a problem behavior or not.  I encourage you to continue to keep a close eye on your son’s development in conjunction with your health professionals.  You may wish to look at some of the following websites for additional information about early indicators of ASDs.

        Unfortunately, I don't think I can answer this question, as this forum specializes in Autism Spectrum Disorders, and the background of the doctors on this forum is in Applied Behavior Analysis, not neurology or other organic disorders.  I would recommend that you contact your pediatrician, who should be able to better answer your question (or at least point you in the direction of someone who can).

On a positive note, I am happy to hear that your son is doing well and seems to be progressing normally!  Good luck to your family.

Did you take the baby to a neurologist after he was born?  What did they say?  Trying to bump you so one of the experts will answer.  I know it is a terrible cross to worry when you child is growing and you had a terrible scare when he was born, but have faith, he will be fine.

676,Having 2 year old evaluated for learning disability...,"
        The problems that you described – problematic behaviors that manifest when something is difficult or frustrating – are fairly common in typically developing children.  And there is certainly some variation in when children acquire certain skills (as it sounds like you and your husband may be worried that he is behind in some areas). Neither of those characteristics necessarily means that your child has a developmental disability; it really depends on the extent of the delay to meeting developmental milestones. 
Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including Autism, Aspergers, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests.  Based on your description, it doesn’t sound as though he meets criteria for these disorders.  However, I would recommend that you contact your pediatrician and explain your concerns in more detail –an in-person consultation with a qualified individual is the best way to determine whether your son is meeting the milestones along what is considered a typical timeline.
Good luck

677,How to help constant Intrusive thoughts for 8 year old PDD NOS Boy,"
        I would certainly recommend continued interaction with your pediatrician attempting to identify the source of the pain your son seems to be experiencing.  It also seems like you have a psychiatrist that you are working with trying to treat the thoughts and sounds your son is reporting. Intrusive thoughts are sometimes observed in individuals with GAD but they are not one of the defining symptoms of autism-spectrum disorders. Intrusive thoughts are commonly treated with both medication and behavioral therapy. The best recommendation that I can give you is to find a therapist with experience working with children like your son and make sure that the psychiatrist prescribing the medication is monitoring its effects and making changes as necessary if the medication is ineffective.

678,Is stimming always related to autism?,"
        Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including Autism, Aspergers, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests.  Based on your description, it’s hard to know which, if any of these, diagnosis fits, and direct evaluation by a qualified professional is necessary for any diagnosis.  If you haven’t already brought this to the attention of your pediatrician, I’d recommend doing so now. Be sure to discuss both the behaviors that you are concerned about (“stimming” is more formally referred to as “stereotypy” in the literature), as well as developmental milestones that he is (or is not) meeting.  As to your main question: Engaging in stereotypy does not mean that your child will end up with a diagnosis of developmental delay – plenty of typically-developing infants and children engage in forms of stereotypy.
Regardless of his diagnosis, childhood behavior problems like stereotypy can typically be addressed through consultation with a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA).  If you feel that the behavior is stigmatizing or interfering with more adaptive behaviors, you may want to consult with a BCBA.  This professional will want to spend time directly observing your child as well as interviewing your family, so that they can provide recommendations on how to best address the issue. A local BCBA can be found at the following site: http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html
Best of luck to you and your family

679,Is stimming always related to autism?,"
        Hi,
I totally understand your concerns.  You didn't mention his age? As you have probably have read, autism spectrum disorders involve more than just stimming (repetitive behavior).  It sounds like you read up on how to diagnosis and he sounds social, and he is communicating and imitating which is great.  Hard to tell how delayed in communication since we don't know his age.  

My son who just turned 2 likes to follow vertical lines from the corner of his eyes while running past things and is speech delayed- with 15 words.  He is in early intervention because of this weird behavior and delay and speech.  The EI team came and they were saying no to autism but i was not so sure.  I actually video taped it and took him to a neurologist.  Since my son was easily distracted from the activity and he didn't do it alot, she wasn't too concerned.  Actually i can't remember when he did it last and it appears it comes and goes.  She asked me a lot of questions about his ""social"" abilities, had him do some activities, watched his eye contact which was good and said b/c he doesn't do that activity alot meaning --what is his normal play activity?  Does he play with toys appropriately and engage in other play activites?  Is the stimming your son does alot, obsessive, can you interrupt him without a tantrum? 

To ease your mind i would contact your doctor for a referral to the early intervention team (if he is under 3 yrs old). In NY you don't need a referral from your pediatrician but they can give you the number.   They are absolutely wonderful.  They see alot of kids and they can guide you with your concerns. 

Hope this helps.  Everything with your son will be ok just seek out some help from the professionals and you will feel better.

        well my son will turn 2 next month. the thing he does with his eye has incraesed lately but can be distracted easily. He doesn't throw tantrums when I take away his wheel while he is spinning, would cry though alot and will stop as soons as I carry him and bounce him or engage in another activity. But If i don't make an attempt to stop he would spin the wheel for a long time. He seems so obsessed with wheels and fans and washing machines and everything that spins that's y I'm so concerned.

681,Is stimming always related to autism?,"
        I was worried as well so i understand. My worries have subsided a lot because in 4 wks he is improving with speech, he's added 5 words and more word approximations,is using sign language to communicate, and has increased his pointing and labeling of objects tremendously.  This was all possible with Early intervention coming to my home.  In addition the neurologist said, ""at this point she would say he is expressive speech delayed not ASD.  She told me to only come back if he didn't improve with speech or his behavior became obsessive or intensified.  Well his speech improved and that""running-eye"" behavior has really decreased, if not gone and he is v.social, the youngest of 5.  I still am concerned and i am watching him but i am sleeping better. My son never obsessed with spinning things.  He would drop one object or line them up, run by them with his eyes and drop his head right when he got to the object.  He would also ocassionally follow the line of the kitchen table with his eyes.  This is what i video-taped for the neurologist.

What eased my worries was getting help.  Trust me, go to your pediatrician and explain your concerns.  The spinning thing is a red flag as well as the stimming and you can only ease your mind and move forward with the help of professionals who are experts in child development or autistic spectrum disorders.  I know it is scary but there are great people out their willing and able to help you.  I hope this helped.

        well I forgot to mention to u that I got him checked by a specialist, we did a test called(ADOS) where they tested his activity level and eye contact and many other things. But to be honest , the test didn't help me put my mind at ease.I was told that there's nothing much we can do now but start speech therapy and see if he progresses verbally.They couldn't give a diagnose now since My son is still young and I had to do the test again in 6 months. So basically I have to go for the wait and see approach which is the hardest thing to do. I'm always watching him and everytime he acts weird or does that thing with his eye I really get so upset. He is my only son and i just can't take that there could possibly be soemthing wrong with him. It's the hardest thing that i've ever been through and I can't wait to get over with all that.

        Hang in there!  I too didn't get relief from the neurologist.  I thought i would have answers but i didn't, they felt he was too young to go further in testing and since he was improving with regard to communication it was a good sign- I still have my doubts but having EI involved makes the world of difference.

Has your soon improved since you saw the specialist?  Is he getting speech therapy right now and is showing slow progress, slow and steady?  Is his behavior increased or become more obsessive ?You got a pretty extensive test (ADOS) what were the results?  If you really have a gut feeling you can always get a 2nd opinion or go back and tell them your concerns.  You have to focus on getting the RIGHT therapy for your precious son.  It is so hard to wait and trust what the professionals are telling you when you see him everyday and everytime he does that quirky thing you are reminded of AUTISM, but trust me, try to focus on doing all you can do for him to help him achieve his goals.   

I had to ask myself what I was really looking for with my son, and i finally realized that waiting was ok for me because (1) I accept him and love him no matter what quirky or delays he has- he is a gift from God and (2) As long as he was getting the right services for his age at the recommendation of the specialists & improving i didn't focus on the diagnosis as much. If it turns out in 3 mths that he doesn't improve as much as they would like or things change than we will reassess services.

686,My 12 year old son,"
        PDD-NOS is a diagnosis given to individuals that do not meet the criteria for an autism diagnosis because of late development of symptoms or symptoms that do not meet the required threashold. Usually this is given if there is impairment in communication and social interaction and/or the presence of stereotyped patterns of behavior. This is often a matter of judgment on the part of the diagnostician. It may be that a new diagnostician would change the previous diagnosis or it may be that your son may now meet the criteria for a diagnosis of autism. PDD-NOS is categorized in the DSM as one of the autism disorders and, occasionally, a child will be diagnosed with PDD-NOS when there appears to be impairment but a full diagnosis of autism doesn’t seem warranted.

687,"Does my son have a speech delay or an ASD, PDD?","
        Communication delays and repetitive patterns of behavior are part of the diagnostic criteria for autism. The fact that he enjoys social interaction is a great sign but I would still recommend seeking a formal assessment for him and, even if he does not meet the criteria for an autism diagnosis, I would recommend seeking help for his language delay. Intervening as early as possible is very important whether he is officially diagnosed or not. People are in tough financial situations all over but get on the phone, talk to your pediatrician and your school district about options for having your son assessed and getting intervention for his language delay. If your son has a disability, the school district must ensure that he is getting the services that he needs. This is often an uphill battle for parents but it’s a fight that needs to be had to make sure that your son receives the interventions that he needs.

690, 20yr old with aspergers,"
        It sounds like your son has made tremendous progress and I think many parents of individuals diagnosed with autism will relate to what you’re saying. This lack of sensitivity to social situations, to social interactions, is a common theme underlying the autism diagnosis. It is almost unbearably hard to love an individual with autism and not see signs of that being reciprocated. Your son is who he is and, while he can learn and grow, there is nothing that I can recommend that will take away his autism. He is a unique individual who, like all of us, has his strengths and weaknesses and, at the end of the day, he has to be accepted and loved for who he is. I have known many parents of individuals with autism who have found comfort and understanding in talking with other parents going through what they are and in sharing their experiences with them. Perhaps you would find this helpful as well.

693,masturbation,"
        Masturbation is not entirely uncommon even at that age and it isn’t necessarily something to be overly concerned about. As with typically developing children, as your son gets older, expect him experiment as he becomes more familiar with the sensations he is experiencing. Usually, the focus for children with autism who begin masturbating isn’t on getting them to stop but rather teaching them when and where it is and isn’t appropriate. It sounds like you are worried that this might be related to possible sexual abuse or some sort of sexual encounter that he might have had. The masturbation, in and of itself, is not atypical and doesn’t necessarily indicate this. If you have concerns, keep your eyes open for any other signs and talk to his teachers about what they are seeing but, if it is just the masturbation, it does not need to be a major concern.

        Another condition that has many of the characteristics of autism is Fragile X Syndrome, the leading genetic cause of mental impairment.  It is a single gene disorder that can be passed to children by one parent.  If the mother is the carrier, then her sons or daughters will have a 50% chance of inheriting this condition.  If the father is the carrier, then only his daughters will also inherit the premutation form of fragile x.  

Many children with fragile x also have a seizure disorder, developmental delay and ADD/ADHD.  For more information, visit www.fragilex.org and www.fraxa.org.  The MIND Institute in California is a premier scientific resource for both autism, fragile x and other related conditions.  Our daughter (now 33) was first diagnosed with autism at age 3, but at age 12 was found to have the full mutation of fragile x.  In the past 5 years, my oldest brother,& his two daughters, our mother, her elderly sister and oldest son  tested positive for the premutation form of fragile x.  Now we have closure as to the reason many of us struggled in school.  Do look into this syndrome which requires a specific genetic test, not usually included when testing for Down syndrome and other conditions.

give your son some time.. try not to worry so much.. he sounds perfect to me.. everyones different... and he has his own likes and mannerisms.

704,Autism or delay? ,"
        My son is 2 1/2 years old and he has no vocabulary. He points to everything he wants or needs. If you ask him a yes or no question he will answer by moving his head for yes or no. He is very loving and good with other people ( a bit shy at first) though he gets very frustrated when he can not communicate his needs to us. Alot of times we are asking him a million times this this this this???? pointing at everything to see if he wants something. 

He is a very independent little boy. Watches tv for hours and will play by himself for hours. 
We had a hearing test done and found out he has a mild hearing loss but the doctor said that might be because he has fluid in his ears. He had tubes but in and has also had his adenoid removed. He goes back for a hearing test in a few weeks but his ENT said he doesn't think that him having the fluid in his ear has anything to do with him not talking but goes deeper then that.

Is there a specialist that he would see to see if he is autism?

        Please listen to me-
Your child is normal! My daughter is 2.5 years old and was diagnosed with autism 1 month ago. We have been doing all sorts of therapy in home for the past 8 months and she now goes to pre-school. while Madeline has many strengths, she has many consistent charactoristics of autism. She has very poor eye contact, rarely (20%) responds to her name, does not initiate activities with other, lines up her toys, has trouble making her needs known, has many tantrums in frusteration, repeats a handful of single words (inconsistently) has no expressive language. On the other hand she is very affectionate, loves to cuddle (with immediate family), has good cognitive skills for her age, and gross and fine motor are great. Madeline is considered high functioning. Please stop worrying and enjoy your child, he has a speech delay as simple as that.

706,More sensitive to sounds and control issues popping up,"
        Even if there’s some disagreement on the particular diagnosis, you are on the right track. No matter what the diagnosis is, the particular difficulties your son experiences can be addressed and early intervention can be very effective. Speech therapy and exposure and practice in social interactions can be extremely helpful. As your son ages and learns and grows, new problems will crop up along the way as they will with any child. OT can be effective for improving coordination and gross and fine motor skills. If your child finds certain types of sensation aversive, systematically exposing him to those sensations may be effective. Unfortunately, there are many approaches to teaching and providing therapy to individuals with autism-like disorders that have not been shown to be effective or have been shown to be ineffective. Sensory integration is a relatively popular approach to treatment that the weight of the evidence suggests is ineffective. 

The best advice I can give you is to identify the particular things you’d like to see your son working on, and monitor his progress on those things. Identify a behavior analyst in your area who has experience working with children like your son and work with him or her on a plan for your son. Finding a good behavior analyst who works well with you and your son can be enormously helpful and this person should also be able to help you consume the scientific literature on treatments and guide you toward approaches that are supported by science.

707,More sensitive to sounds and control issues popping up,"
        Speech therapist and OT who are working with my son advised us against ABA in its pure form; they beleive that he does have the skills necessary for learning (imitation, play skills, etc), he has problems with compliance and seeks negative attention a lot. They do not view ABA approaches as suitable for him.....

I know there are programs in ABA that adress compliance, but both OT and Speech therapist beleived that it may very well make him more defiant and less willing to learn


We did have ABA therapist come to our house, she did some training with us, but she sis not beleive he needs one-on-one therapy...... 

So are you saying that OT is completely innefective?

        The eye contact, enjoyment of social interaction, and talking are all great signs. There is no rule about children who do not point by 12 months having autism. As with any developmental step, there is a range and each child moves at his or her own pace. If you have any concerns though, it’s always a good idea to speak with your pediatrician about your concerns and to seek out professionals who are experts in diagnosing autism. Early intervention is extremely important and there are really no disadvantages to having your child assessed.

        Autism is a disorder defined by behavioral characteristics that involve delays in communication and repetitive movements and or activities. Differing people can meet the criteria for an autism diagnosis for differing reasons. Based on your description, it seems possible that your daughter might meet the autism criteria and I would recommend having her assessed, you doctor should be able to identify professionals in your area to do this. You are also identifying some issues that are not defining features of autism (i.e., clumsiness, low weight, etc...) and I would absolutely recommend continuing to attempt to find medical causes for these problems.

        Autism diagnoses involve impairments in social interaction and communication as well as the presence of stereotyped movements or activities.

Early intervention can make a huge difference and if he does not receive an autism diagnosis.

        Risperidone is an antipsychotic that may decrease problem behavior in some individuals. If you are not seeing effects, it may be that your son is not at an effective dose or it may be that the medication is just not effective for him. Unfortunately, there is no medication that will help your son begin to speak. Medication like risperidone has serious side effects, its efficacy needs to be continually monitored to make sure that it is producing a clinically significant benefit for your son, and there should be ongoing attempts to attempt to taper and remove the medication as soon as possible. The choice of appropriate medication is one that should be made by your son’s psychiatrist, taking your input into account. It is extremely important that you have a good working relationship with the psychiatrist. If you are unsure why a medication is being used, how its effects will be measured, or how decisions will be made about increasing or decreasing doses, seek a different psychiatrist.

        My concern is that the Dr. is saying alot of the same things our Dr. said before we moved on. A five yr old should be able to converse in a ""typical"" way. The things you describe would indicate to me that something neurological is going on whether it is autism or on the spectrum I couldn't say. I would urge the mother to seek help through her local childrens hospital. Many have autism programs and could put her in touch with a Dr that specializes in autism. I would think that the child needs to be assessed. The average age of diagnosis is 2.5 yrs. It is 3-4 times more likely to be seen in boys than it is girls but that DOESN'T mean there are not autistic girls because there are. Good Luck

        First and foremost, I would suggest that your son be screened by a specialist in developmental disabilities.  Not walking by 2 and having limited communication skills is very concerning.  It seems you are in or near the Washington area.  If this is the case there is a very well known autism center at the University of Washington (website: http://depts.washington.edu/uwautism/).  They offer a number of services from developmental screening to educational and clinical services.  I suggest you start there.

Though it was suggested that you seek a DAN! doctor, I would not recommend anyone with that ""training.""  Biomedical intervention for any developmental issue should be backed by sound scientific research and that has not been my experience with any DAN doctor.

Also he had a lack of essential vitamins and had high levels of metals. Which I believe was from his shots.

721,Why does my son behave so strangely?,"
        Diagnostic criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (including Autism, Aspergers, and others) include delays in social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped or restricted behavior and interests.  Based on your brief description, it’s hard to know which, if any of these, diagnosis fits, and direct evaluation by a qualified professional is necessary for any diagnosis.  If you haven’t already brought this to the attention of your pediatrician, I’d recommend doing so now. Be sure to discuss both your behavioral/developmental concerns, as well as the toileting, specifically – apparent incontinence (or voiding in inappropriate places) can signal a medical issue such as a bladder infection or chronic bowel issue.
Regardless of his diagnosis, childhood behavior problems can typically be addressed through consultation with a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst.  This professional will want to spend time directly observing your child as well as interviewing your family, so that they can provide recommendations on how to best address the issue.

        I believe you have reason to be concerned. I would suggest that you find identify a hospital in an urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children who present developmental delays. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations. You can then take these recommendations to your local early intervention program. 

The most effective treatment for children with autism is early intensive behavioral intervention. This means that your son should receive 20 hours of direct teaching in language, social skills and self-help skills. Services can be provided by early intervention or the public schools in your area. You may want to look for behaviorally trained professionals to supervise a treatment program by checking www.bacb.com for a person in your area.

723,bedtime and sleeping,"
        I think it would help for you to be more in control of the bedtime routine. As you have described it, you son is successful in delaying bedtime (and your departure) by dawdling and making requests. Make sure your son's needs are met before starting the bedtime routine. Give him a few sips of water, and take him to the bathroom. Then start the routine. You should give your son a few minutes to pick a book. To speed this along, give him just a few books to choose from. If he doesn't choose in a minute or two, choose for him. Over time he will learn to choose quickly if choosing is important to him. If you both enjoy lying together before he goes to sleep, do that for a brief period, but do not allow him to prolong your visit by whining or negotiating. It may be best to start this briefer routine later in the evening to increase the likelihood that he will fall asleep quickly, allowing both of you to meet success. Then gradually move the routine earlier so that you can get your son to sleep at a reasonable time. Checking back every 5 min or so if fine. If you do this, minimize your interaction and just tuck your son back in as you did before leaving his bedroom initially.

        i am a member of a autism play group that meets once a week, all the adults and children suffer from sleep disorder
for me it has little to do with ""bed time"" or trying to get away with staying up late, for my son too
its more to do with the inability to sleep, no way to stop thinking to get to sleep, i read but sometimes i go several nights without sleeping, 
this all started for me when i was around 8 and my son started around 5, after doctors visits, forced bed times, sleeping pills, i found a few things that did work, first see how wired your child is, i read to my son every night, sometimes thats enough, but on nights when he is showing all his aspie defects i give him a massage with organic coconut oil, and let me tell you it works!!! he falls asleep fast, on moderate nights we also use book on cds after story time, he has a cd player beside his bed, we turn it on and let him listen to it until he falls asleep
,i do this for my son because i remember the obsessive thoughts i had at bed time as a small child, they would attack me when i laid down, there was a definant forced bedtime, there were nights when i just stayed up all night, then went to school the next day, most of my childhood i was on ritalin so that did not help, now i take tenex for my asper symptoms and it has really helped, and is not narcotic
because of my life experience with this condition i take half an hour a piece to put each of my children to bed, its really not that long, 30 minutes out of your day to spend one on one, 
well this is a doctors forum, i do not even know why i am posting this, maybe because its late and i cannot sleep, 
when an adult cannot sleep they are not forced to stay in the bed alone with their thoughts, i typically allow my kids to get out of bed if they cannot sleep, usually i am up so we can talk for a few minutes and then they are ready for bed, i do not know why or how this works but it does

        Autism is characterized by delays in social development and language development and the presence of repetitive behavior.

From your description, it does not sound like your son has social difficulites, and the only repetittive behavior that you mentioned is repeating lines from movies.

I think it is also important for me to mention that the increase in autism awareness has led to early diagnosis and intervention for many children but has also resulted in undue concern for many families. For example, even typically developing children are not interested in social interaction and affection all of the time and many play in repetitive ways.

        One of his goals is to stop taking the medicine for awhile.  There is sometimes slight improvement in behavior or so in the next week (decreased lethargy, seemingly reduced depression, etc.), but in all of the attempts he has tried, was always followed by a much worse bout of mania or extreme anxiety that necessitated more hospitalization and the need to go back onto the medicine.

As a child, he was slightly weird (showed his penis to random people in the playground in elementary school, banged his head against the wall sometimes during junior high school [and did it a few times recently, really hard]).  However, we never suspected he had autistic spectrum disorder.

He was always a good artist and drew extremely well when he was younger, but hasn't drawn much at all in the past few years.

Over the past few years he has been in and out of the hospital for reasons such as the above.  At the hospital, he has had conflicts with the staff (showed his genitals to the nurses, sleeps outside on the field even though he has a bed, ran away from the hospital [necessitating helicopter searches], etc.).

He sometimes have bouts where he moves his arms and legs in weird ways and seems to have little control over keeping them still, during which he cannot communicate well (we ask him ""what are you doing?"" he says ""i ... can't ... "" and has a lot of trouble completing the sentence, often swearing).

We have tried therapy but he did not communicate with the therapists, so they gave up.  We have tried counselling -- same result.  We have tried many types of medication, none of which seem to be perfect for bringing him back to his old self. 

What we have considered him having (** = certain, ? = unlikely):
Asperger's Syndrome
Autistic Spectrum Disorder
Bipolar Disorder
Depression **
Rett's Syndrome? (seems like something that occurs since childhood)
ADD
Tourette's
Schizophrenia
Delusional Disorder
Insanity

Please help; we have tried for the past few years and we still don't know exactly what he has; the doctors don't know either (they have labelled him as having autistic spectrum disorder but nothing beyond that).  It is starting to drive us insane as well, especially with recent behavior.  Thank you...

        You did not mention difficulties with social interaction or repetitive behavior, which are primary characteristics of autism spectrum disorders. It sounds as those his difficulties with attention and other behavior problems are the primary concern. The website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board has a list of certified professionals, and there are a few in India (http://www.bacb.com/becom_frame.html). I think it would beneficial for you to get some professional help with your son's behavior. There are some fairly simple behavior management programs that would likely work well. In addition, please discuss any developmental concerns with your regualar pediatrician who could direct you to some local resources for assessment, if necessary.

739,smearing of feces,"
        It would not be a bad idea to provide alternative activites that provide sensory stimulation, but these activities should not be connected to fecal smearing attempts. That is, if you want to increase stimulation, do that according to a schedule independent of fecal smearing. Some sensory programs inadvertently reward inappropriate behavior. For example, some programs involve allowing children access to a swing when they are behaving inappropriately in the classroom. In this case, the child may learn that they get a break and a fun activity when they behavior inappropriately.

I would strongly encourage you to focus on close supervision during toileting visits and other opportunities to smear feces. Any attempts to manipulate feces should be prevented by gently guiding the child's hands away from the area. Do not comment. If close supervision is not possible during all times when fecal smearing is likely, you might try a reward system. At first, give small frequent rewards for keeping the area and hands clean. You can later reduce the frequency of rewards. Also, the child's pediatrician should rule out (or treat) any medical reason for this behavior.

        Hi
I also work with a young adult with severe Autism whom smeres feces as well.  I am not sure of the age range that your speaking with or what type of setting that your in.  We are a community  residential setting.  The guys that we work with have access to helping us do chores even if they are prompted or hand over hand.  When our guy smeres we have him help clean it up hand over hand.  It is not pleasent for neither.  He hates the gloves he has to wear and also hates to help. Then we get him to put the soiled clothes towels etc in the laundry. But, within a couple weeks he is no longer smereing.  We do still get the odd time.  But if this is a school setting it would be not a great place to work on the behaviour.  

When he was in school and he did  this we would do a round of sensory activities before toileting him.  This seemed to help a bit.  We made up a bunch of containers with lids.  In the containers we a variety of different scents.  Anything from coffee to vanilla to materials to spices.  This seems to satisfy the need to smell anything innapropiate.

This also worked with my own two children who have Autism.

743,7 Year old boy with Aspergers,"
        Regardless of the child's motivation for wearing his mothers clothes, it is important for her to get control of this behavior. She must be able to restrict his access to her personal belongings and to unsafe materials in the home. Therefore, I would start with gettting her some help to work on his compliance.

I would recommend making sure that the child has access to appropriate dress-up materials in a location that is avaialble to him. I don't think there is anything wrong with providing male and female dress-up clothes to children of both genders, but this is certainly the decision of the family.

In addition to avoiding telling the child that he is bad, I would recommend minimizing other forms of attention for this behavior. Based on the description, I suspect that the child get's a strong reaction from his family when he is caught. In some cases, these reactions can further encourage the behavior.

If the family is concerned about gender/sexual identity issues, I recommend that they contact a local professional with expertise in this area.

        Taking this post in context with your previous one, it looks like you are doing exactly the right thing.  At your son’s age, it can be difficult to tell if his language is developing a little slowly or if he might have a diagnosable condition.  The eye contact, the fact that he is very social, him looking like he’s attempting to say something to you are all great signs.  The progress that you are reporting from his ABA therapy also is really encouraging.  The best way to address your concerns, at this point, is to identify potential deficits that he may have, areas that he seems to be behind, and seek out services to help address those.  If it turns out that he ends up meeting the criteria for a diagnosis for an autism-spectrum disorder, then you are ahead of the game.  If he doesn’t, you’re still getting him valuable services that can help speed up his development in the areas you’re targeting.  I would recommend having him seen by a specialist in another few months to see if a diagnosis is warranted given the progress you will have seen by that point.

        I agree that the difficulties you describe with your son do not seem consistent with Asperger’s disorder, which is characterized by restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and activities with no significant delays in language acquisition. However, I recommend you discuss your son’s potential language delay, behavioral and feeding difficulties with your son’s pediatrician. A medical professional can rule out medical issues that may be related to your son’s speech delay. I also recommend that you ask your pediatrician to refer your son to an early intervention clinic for an evaluation. They can conduct a formal assessment to determine whether or not your son has a delay that qualifies for early intervention services. I also recommend that you contact a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, for the behavioral difficulties you describe. A behavior analyst can assist you in developing a plan for how to manage your son’s tantrum behavior. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers.

You noted some social difficulties, but did not mention repetitive behavior, precoccupations, inflexible routines, or other behaviors that fit into that second category. If you feel that he meets these criteria, you should have him evaluated by a professional with experience diagnosing autism spectrum disorders.

Could this have an effect on the some of these behaviors?

        I would not be concerned about your son watching TV why you cook or clean, as long as he gets plenty of play and interaction time also. Your son has learned to fall asleep through rocking/nursing, so when he wakes in the night he requires this same stimulation to get back to sleep. To change this pattern, he would need to learn to fall asleep on his own. From your description, it does not necessarily sound like you see his sleep as a problem. If it becomes a problem, talk with your pediatrician about how to change this pattern.

        It may be that there is something annoying or unfamiliar about wearing shoes (rather than physical pain), but to be safe you could start by ruling out any medical issues if you haven’t already done so. After that, you may want to try some type of gradual fading program.  You could start by assessing whether there are any types of shoes that she will wear even for a short period (try different types – sandals, flip flops, yard shoes, sneakers, etc. – as well as different materials).  Once settling upon a pair that seem least bothersome to her, you should identify preferred activities or items that she might be able to earn for wearing the shoes for a very short period – depending on her tolerance, you may have to start with just a few seconds, or even just putting them on and taking them off.  As she is successful with the short periods, very gradually increase the amount of time that she is required to wear them before earning the treat/activity.  This type of strategy can take time, so you may need to keep with it for several weeks before she will wear them for extended periods.  If you are having continued difficulty, you may be able to find resources or advice from a Board Certified Behavior Analyst in your area (http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html).

It is interesting that your son shows some difficulties at home that he does not show at school. It is common for children to behave differently in different situations, and this reminds us that the environment has influence over children's behavior. It is likely that your son exerts more control over his physical and social environment at home because he can. His teacher cannot possible accomodate his preferences given that he/she is responsible for a large group of children, and he has learned to handle this situation. You are inclined to make your son happy and so you do what you can to accomodate him. You might consider identifying some rituals, routines, preferences that are problematic and then addressing those. For example, your son should not control when you go to bed. Teach your son to tolerate change by gradually introducing change under supportive circumstances. You can support your son by teaching him some strategies for dealing with unpredictability (e.g., relaxation or distraction) and rewarding his cooperation with these changes.

772,Nineteen Month Old - Autism/PPD NOS Question,"
        My 20 month old son has some similar characteristics and I am just now looking into possible Autism. He does look us in the eye but does not maintain that eye contact. He will respond to his name most of the time, but when asked to do something, he usually stares off into ""space"" and won't follow through. He seems to be in his own little world, however he does play socially with others. He has no words other than da-da and ma-ma sometimes. He says buh-buh for just about everything and will say uh-oh sometimes. We are in the process of having him evaluated for speech/OT for food/oral aversions. He will only eat crunchy food and nothing with any type of soft/wet textures. We've been told that he quite likely has a sensory disorder, but I'm wondering if it could be more, possibly on the Autism spectrum. Any thoughts/suggestions?

773,Nineteen Month Old - Autism/PPD NOS Question,"
        Dr. Thompson-

Thanks so much for your response.  We do have him in both ABA therapy and speech therapy at this point.  I guess the thing that's concerning to me is the lack of response to his name (although he does seem to be getting nominally better at this) and the fact he was saying three of four words (Hi Dada, Baba, Mama).  

Since beginning ABA therapy two weeks ago he has begun to say a few words again and is waving Hi and Bye fairly regularly.  

I guess I always assume autism or pdd nos as I know he has two classic red flags for those conditions.  Do you see children with these symptoms that go on to simply be diagnosed as temporary development delays?

        Hi, 
I had the early intervention team(developmental teacher and speech pathologist) come and observe my son for an hour last week.  I watched him answer his name, come build 4 blocks put them back in and out of a bucket, clapped with them.  They then asked him 3 questions to pick different toys, he did all three, two incorrectly but she said he's inconsistent b/c it appeared he looked at the right one but may have wanted the other object like the bananna over the juice cup.  After that he had enough and pushed his toy cart around and then played with his ball in the kitchen.  He walked in and out but didn't seem to interested in sitting with us or the toys in bag.  Grunted when asked to pick pictures from a book and walked away.  At one point he started lining up two toys and ""running it"" but they didn't seem concerned.  I asked again but they said quirks like that are ok if not with other things.  They saw him independantly play in the toy room and said that works against his speech ability and his social skills.

He qualified for speech and special ed and i am meeting with them again in july to go over services.  I asked if he was autistic and they said no he didn't show the typical signs they would see when they met him b/c of his eye contact.  

Today he lined up like 6 different objects, anything he can find in the room, walks/runs the line with his head down.  Now he walks over them with his head down.  when we the other kids get on the ground near him he plays with them by wrestling and hugging but will get up and run faster down the line.  It is so quirky.  The other children now give him things and he lines them up.  Also, now that he's taller, every once in a while, he walks by the stove handle and turns his eyes to the line.

Today i showed him a picture of 3 elmos on a card with balloons.  I asked him to show me where elmo was.  He didn't. When i asked him to count them with me, he made sounds and pointed to all three.

I find my son truly fascinating because like right now he is playing (making sounds) with my other 3 kids in the back room as they build forts, crawling in and out yet he can't talk and lines up toys, has weird gazes, but loves to build blocks, and shape puzzles and has a beautiful disposition, eats, sleeps and cuddles great.     

I want to be sure i ask the right questions to this development teacher and speech pathologist to make sure if he is on the autistic spectrum we get the right treatment.  If i ask again and they tell me no should i get a second opinion and from whom?  If he truly is on the autism spectrum and I wait like a year, what harm or missed opportunity will there have been for my son?

        The numeric coding that you describe is not universal to all individuals with autism, and I suspect that only your grandaughter can help with the decoding. Rather than play along with the codes, you might consider just encouraging her to use peoples names, a skill that will be expected of her in the long run. If the family finds it enjoyable to play along, consider teaching her the conditions under which number codes are acceptable (e.g., at home) and those under which she should use peoples names.

782,Defining Asperger's,"
        Although one of the diagnostic criteria for Asperger’s Disorder is stereotyped patterns of behavior similar to your son’s wrist flapping, there are a number of other criteria that need to be present to receive this diagnosis. In addition to stereotyped and repetitive motor movements, individuals with a diagnosis of Asperger’s Disorder usually exhibit more than one form of impairment in social interaction (e.g., limited eye contact, lack of social initiations or interest in others). In addition, the impairment in social interaction and repetitive motor stereotypy limits the individual’s overall functioning. From your description, it sounds like your son may not meet all of the diagnostic criteria to receive the Asperger’s Diagnosis. However, to determine the cause of his wrist flapping and to receive services to treat this problem, I recommend that you seek the assistance of a qualified professional who specializes in the diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorders. This is the only way to definitely determine whether or not your son has a diagnosis of Asperger’s Disorder or a related disorder, and more importantly, it will allow you to identify appropriate services for your son. I also recommend that you seek the support of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, who would be able to conduct an assessment and determine an effective intervention for decreasing your son’s wrist flapping behavior. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers.

        Yes, children often learn to perform differently in different situations. A child who swears under some conditions may not swear in front of a parent because (a) the parent does not present the situations that often result in swearing, or (b) the parent has a different manner of responding to problem behavior. The good news is that this pattern of behavior can provide some clues about how to reduce the swearing. For example, adults should probably (a) follow through with assignments and routine changes even when the child has a negative reaction, (b) consider whether the assignments are well matched to the child's skill level, (c) try to decrease the unpleasantness of routine changes and assignments by, for example, providing choices between tasks, embedding preffered activities within tasks or difficult transitions, or providing rewards for compliance.

        You certainly have many questions but the main point seems to be that you question the diagnosis of autism for your son.  You mention that his school has diagnosed him as having an autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  Some schools have excellent diagnosticians who are experienced and well qualified to make such diagnoses but many do not.  You also mention that there has been metabolic testing that has not come back abnormal.  Though many have suggested metabolic abnormalities in persons with autism, metabolic testing is not a valid means of diagnosing autism.  In fact, if one were to rely soley on genetic/metabolic testing only about 40% of cases of autism would be diagnosed and this testing would cost well over $30,000 per child (according to tiered pricing offered for genetic evaluations by qualified geneticists).  Such genetic evaluation usually occurs following the diagnosis of an ASD.  To definitively determine whether your son has an ASD, I suggest that you find a developmental specialist who is qualified to adminster the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (or ADOS).  With this test you will have an answer to that question.

        As you recognized in your post, your daughter's safety should be the highest priority. Having your son live with his father would certainly reduce the opportunity for inappropriate contact with your daughter. However, there will still be opportunities for these interactions with your daughter and with others, so it is important for your son to get the help he needs to develop appropriate socio-sexual behavior and eliminate inappropriate contact. I recommend that you seek behavioral counseling that is appropriate to your son's cognitive abilities. In the meantime, as I am sure you are now aware, your son should be supervised closely. It will also be important to teach your daughter self-protections skills. You should talk with her about what type of physical contact is approriate and what type is inappropriate and have her practice what to do when someone attempts inappropriate contact. These skills should involve (a) recognizing attempts at unsafe contact early, (b) leaving the area, (c) notifying an adult. Research suggests that children must practice these skills and that just talking about these situations does not insure that children will perform the skills when the situation arises.

        All of the characteristics that you describe can occur in children who develop typically. So, I am not immediately concerned about autism from your description. However, I do recommend that you share your concerns with your pediatrician and that you continue to monitor your child's social development and language closely. It is important to intervene early when a developmental difficulty is detected. In the meantime, continue to encourage social interaction, language, and play skills that will eventually replace the flapping and twirling that you described.

        Well, I'm not a doctor but I don't think any 11 year old should be talking like that. Have you notified the school board about the child's actions? If you haven't yet you should immediately. And the parents should definitely be concerned about their child's actions. It doesn't sound like they're very good parents if they let him run around like a psycho threatening kids half his age. Like I said, I'd make sure the school knows about this and are monitoring that child.

812,Adults with Autism who bite,"
        Treatment of sever problem behavior, such as biting and other forms of aggression, can be quite complex and should be supervised by a board certified behavior analyst (BCBA) who has experience designing and implementing such treatments.  I recommend that you look for an appropriate BCBA in your area to oversee the analysis and treatment and I don’t have sufficient information in this case to give specific recommendations but I can tell you the types of analyses that should be conducted.  Functional analysis is the most reliable method of informing treatment for severe problem behavior.  This involves conducting a series of conditions to identify the reinforcer(s) maintaining the behavior and to experimentally rule out other confounding variables.  In the case of very severe aggression, such as biting, there are also data supporting the utility of conducting a functional analysis of precursor responses rather than the aggression itself.  This involves identification of reliable precursors (i.e., responses that often precede aggression and might be used to predict the aggression) and this might be done using a descriptive analysis and collecting data on the proportion of aggression that is preceded by various responses and the proportion of time that each of those potential precursor responses are followed by aggression.  Once a maintaining variable is identified, an appropriate treatment can be selected, typically some form of differential reinforcement (i.e., reinforcing appropriate requesting and not reinforcing aggression whenever possible).

        Question is, where did she learn it? My son learened to cuss and then unlearned it, while dad was not cussing, then started all over once Dad slipped into cussing. He started back full throttle the very second he heard Dad cuss. 
Locking in a bedroom is a bad idea. Being consistent in both households is a good idea. Timeout can be implemented, but if she never ""stayed"" in timeout - expect her to escalate behavior for about 2 weeks. Still, be consistent and keep returning her to time-out, do not talk to her.

For me, the most succesful strategy with cussing was to correct him (we do not say these words) and do not show too much emotional reaction. Then it goes away (for 2 weeks it will be getting worse, then better).

Problem with time-out use in children with ASD is that many do not care about it and actually enjoy it.

818,My 6 year old son has an issue with his clothes,"
        It sounds as though the problem is that he doesn’t put on the clothes that you have picked out the night before.  It’s difficult to know exactly why he is doing this.  One possibility is that he is trying to avoid the clothes you’ve picked out for some particular reason, perhaps because they are uncomfortable in some way.  In this case, you might want to try letting him independently pick out the clothes he’d like to wear, and maybe even pick out two outfits the night before – this way, he still has a choice in the morning and you’ve had a chance to pre-approve the outfit.  If he does seem to consistently avoid particular outfits, you might try taking him out to try on clothes when you are buying them, so that he is able to help pick out clothes that he likes and may be more likely to wear.

As you mentioned, it’s also possible that he does want some attention from you, in which case you should be trying to minimize the amount of attention that he gets for not following your directions, and provide plenty of attention for doing what you’d like for him to do (picking out and putting on the clothes).  Some type of visual aide may be helpful in this case.  You might try a “getting ready” checklist that he can use to help him stay on task with all of the tasks involved in getting ready in the morning. The checklist could consist of either written instructions or even just pictures of the relevant tasks.  This may allow you to step back on how much you need to supervise him (and how much attention he gets when he’s slow) and provide a more neutral format for directions from you.  For example, you could praise him for what he’s already completed on his checklist, and then prompt him to look at his checklist and see what he needs to do next.

Good luck.

828,Does my son have Asperger's,"
        Hi,
I am going through the same thing with my 17 year old son. We always knew that he was immature and he was labeled as ADHD at about 7 years old. It is a long story, but I just recently realized that many of the issues he has could be considered Aspergers. Also, he is not growing ""growing up"" like we always assumed he would.

He also does not have any male friends, does not consider consequences of his actions, does not take a shower, brush his teeth, clean his room or do his homework without me asking him to. It doesn't matter how much we threaten to punish him or take his privilages away, his behavior does not change.

I recently found out that he was changing into his McDonald's uniform in his car outside of work. It never occured to him that he could get changed in the restroom. It broke my heart! You wouldn't believe the things I am learning about him that I was completely oblivious to. He never offered any information and I just thought he was being a typical teenager, growing away from his parents. Now I know that is so not the case.

You definitely need to see about getting your son tested by a professional, but you should be able to start with the school system. If he does have Aspergers, he would be considered disabled and there are laws that protect his right to receive the proper education and help.

Good luck.

831,Heightened Sensitivity,"
        It will be important to work toward the difficult balance of accommodating your daughter's unusual reactions to sensory stimulation and teaching her how to behave appropriately. It is helpful that your daughter is able to communicate verbally what she prefers and what she finds very uncomfortable. This will allow you, for example, to purchase clothes that she will find comfortable. At the same time, though, she will need to learn to tolerate situations that are unpleasant. You will not be able to remove all unpleasant noise from her environment, so she will need some strategies for coping with noise. I think it would be helpful to have some professional support for the problems that you describe. The goal would be to develop strategies to minimize her discomfort (e.g., providing a choice between two outfits purchased based on her specifications) and to maximize her ability to cope with difficult situations (e.g., gradual exposure to increasingly difficult situations while teaching an appropriate coping response). If you don't already have a psychologist that you think could help, I recommend that you consider contacting a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (see bacb.com).

        You did not mention whether your step son is diagnosed with autism or not. It is common for children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders to respond strongly to certain forms of stimulation, but this is also observed in typically developing children. My suggestion is to honor his preferences when reasonable by letting him choose clothing before getting dress (and to select clothing for purchase). Give him a choice between outifits or articles of clothing that seem to meet his needs. Give him a short period of time to make a selection and then require him to get dressed quickly. Do not allow him to change outfits once he has made a selection and avoid discussing the outfit once dressing has started. Consider providing a reward for dressing within a reasonable time period (e.g., 5 or 10 min). Set a timer and then provide the word if he is completely dressed. If he is not dressed, help him to get dressed with minimal interaction. I agree with the post above that he is probably having some discomfort related to the sensation of clothes, but his difficulities with the dressing routine can be worsened if he is able to avoid school or otherwise control the family's activities.

        Hi Nanuma,

Autism is characterized by severe impairment in social interaction skills, communication skills, and/or stereotyped (ritualistic) behaviors, interests, and activities.  Asperger’s Disorder has a similar profile (restricted interests, delayed or inhibited social interaction skills), but without the developmental and language delays seen in children with a diagnosis of autism.

A wide variety of behaviors might be considered “normal” for a 6-year old, and it’s difficult to tell from just an overview whether your son’s behavior falls significantly outside of the range of normal.  Only a trained professional who has conducted an in-person assessment of your child can diagnose Autism spectrum disorders – I would recommend that you share your concerns with your pediatrician, and get his/her feedback on whether to seek additional help.

Best of luck to you and your son.

840,what would you suggest??,"
        Autism is characterized by language delays, delays in social development, and the presence of repetitive behavior (e.g., rocking, need to have things the same). I am glad that your son is in a school that you like and that he is receiving speech services. If you or his teachers are noticing repetitive behavior or social difficulties, I recommend that you have your son reevaluated by a professional with experience diagnosing autism spectrum disorders.

It would be useful to work with a professional who could help develop a behavior plan to decrease your son's tantrums. The website of the behavior analysis certification board (www.bacb.com) has a list of certified professionals by state. Like any other developmental or behavioral issues, it will be important to address this problem as early as you can so the your son can meet his full potential.

The general strategy is to teach your son that tantrums are not the way to ""get his way."" Effective interventions generally consist of two components. First, it is important that tantrums do not result in any improvement. For example, you mention that teachers provide affection after a tantrum. If he enjoys this affection, this practice may actually increase tantrums. I recommend that you work with a qualified professional and your son's school to identify a consistent way to respond to his tantrums that is unlikely to reward tantrums. For example, it can be effective to remove young children briefly from ongoing activities (e.g., have him sit in a quiet area of the classroom). Minimize attention to the tantrum while protecting the child and his peers. When he is calm, simply return him to the ongoing activity. 

This strategy will be effective only if your son has more appropriate ways to communicate what he wants. Speech therapy will help with this. Also, adults should try to honor his appropriate requests for attention and preferred activities as much as possible (and within reason). Also, provide attention or other rewards when he is engaging in other appropriate behavior such as playing with peers. If he enjoys cuddling, adults should make time for this when he is behaving appropriately and avoid cuddling him after tantrums.

These are the general strategies. A behavior analyst will be able to help to you adapt these strategies to your son's individual needs and preferences. It sounds like your son is a warm likeable child who will do well with some additional support.

        I know that it is quite a frustrating process to identify a diagnosis. Of course, a diagnosis can only be assigned based on a thorough, in-person assessment by a qualified professional. In most cases, a diagnosis is helpful primarily because it provides a means of obtaining services for your child. Most diagnoses don't really explain behavior nor do they specify a treatment; they merely provide a label for a group of characteristics. Your primary concern seems to be your son's problem behavior (e.g., noncompliance, aggression). A large body of research suggests that behavioral interventions are effective in the majority of cases, independent of the diagnosis. I recommend that you identify a Board Certified Behavior Analyst who can help develop a program to improve his behavior. A list of professionals is available at the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (bacb.com). If you don't intervene soon, it will be much harder to control his behavior as he grows.

        Your son and my son have a few things in common.  My son is 14 and was only just diagnosed with Sensory Integration  Disorder/Dysfunction.  I would strongly suggest another evaluation with a different Neuropsychologist and Behavioral Health Consultant,  They test in a variety of modalities and can give you a better understanding of how your ""gifted"" child can be affected by any one of a number of things (like SID) that fall under the GIANT umbrella of disorders/dysfunctions that are in the family of Autism Spectrum.  Now, don't get wrapped up in the lable ""Autism Spectrum"".  It tends to freak parents out.  Keep your eyes and ears open to the explanation of all possibilities and treatments given to you by your next professional evaluator.  By the way, my son has always been in the ""gifted"" catagory, read by himself at age 4, can build anything no matter how difficult it is for an adult, is a whiz at math, skipped a grade in school, BUT HAS ALWAYS HELD HIS EARS, even when ""anticipating a sound"".   he could play alone for many hours by himself when younger, and has at the same time been extremely social and well liked by all adults.  sometimes other kids found his precocious manner of speaking ""funny"", and if you ask him what time it is he will ""tell you how a watch is made"" in great detail.  What I am trying to say is, when a person is affected by something that falls under a ""spectrum"" disorder, you can't expect it to be black and white, or one thing or another.   Its frustration for all, especially when it seems the child is being argumentative or defiantly disobedient.  As for the sensory integration, there's much to know about the vestibular system, tactile sensitivity, etc.  Again, you don;t have to have ""all of the symptoms"" to have the disorder.  But a thorough eval and diagnosis can set you on the right path.  We have had treatment with an OT and continue to do the ""Therapeutic Listening Program"" at home. I can honestly say it has helped.  The times my son will try to put his hands over his ears are far and few between.  His OT has also helped him to have better balance, go on theme park rides he could not previously tolerate (roller coasters, etc.) and his core strength is better.  The pencil holding/handwriting is something that we will also need to work on.  But the help is out there.  You just have to find the right people.  Keep trying until you find it.  Oh, and by the way, my son is in the 9th grade and earns excellent grades in honors classes.  We have to stay on him to make sure he ""follows through"" with assignments and ""pays attention"" and ""listens"", but sometimes you have to do that with kids who don't have these types of disorders.  Just follow your hunch, don't get sidetracked by the fact that he is ""smart"", and help him (now) so that when he is on his own he can function in a very impatient, loud and busy world.

Best of luck.

        Research developments continue to uncover evidence of a genetic basis for autism spectrum disorders, so it would not be surprising to observe autistic characteristics in other family members. If a diagnosis is important to you, I would recommend that you seek assessment through a professional with expertise in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders. Most large urban hospitals will have specialty services in this area, although many will specialize in children.

        My son was suspected to have Asperger's at the age of 2, but where we live it was difficult to get the actual diagnosis until he was 5.  He was still treated for it w/o the diagnosis.  His eyes do that as well, but not a lot.  I have only noticed a couple of times.  Best advice I can give you is appreciate your son.  Autism is not a horrible thing.  My son is wonderful.  He had early intervention....he started a special ed class at a regular public school at the age of 3....he only went 3 days a week at first and went full time at age 4.  He is now 7 and is smarter than most 10 yr olds.  He is in 1st grade and is on a 2nd and 3rd grade regular ed academic level without any problems.  His teacher feels he could probably get on a 5th grade level without it even being challenging but chooses to try to keep him at the same level as most of the kids his age since it's the social aspect that is most challenging in this case.  If the high functioning autism your son has is Asperger's....keep in mind he is hyper sensitive.  He hears things louder so he will talk louder ( and oh, he will talk...sometimes way too much....and very proper).  He tastes more, so foods are a big issue b/c of texture and flavor ( you don't like too much salt on your food do you?).  Remember that what ever you put in his food he will taste at least double what you taste.  Loud noises are a problem so if hair cuts are an issue find someone who has silent clippers or buy some yourself and have the hair dresser use those.  My son has improved in his ability to handle these situations or maybe he is just becoming accustomed to them, but cutting his nails is still a work out for me.  If your son shows signs of Attention Deficit Disorder....that is common....Concerta is the best med for that.  Also, any aggression is common in Asperger's kids.  My son takes Risperdol at night to help with that.  He is just very easily frustrated if things don't go perfectly for him and this also helps him sleep better at night.  With the combination of the two....wow, he is a calm, smart, loving little boy that is crazy about his baby sister (they don't tend to be very jealous because they crave less attention and affection, although, my son has never pulled away from me...he has never begged me to hold him, either).  He is just cleaner.  He hates to have anything messy on him.  He also doesn't like to go outside and play much because he is terrified of bugs...all bugs, flies, gnats, etc! But one difference is that he is overly cautious whereas many autistic kids find themselves in dangerous situations because they fail to realize the danger first.  Although, he desperately wants to see a tornado up close and personal because..""That would just be so cool, Mamma!""  Good Luck with everything!

        An addtional question that I have for the docotr is why she was not diagnosed with PDD-NOS when she was evaluated at the age of 5 years old?  I specifically asked the doctor at the time if she was in the autism spectrum, including PDD-NOS or Aspergers. I was told that all her behavior was related to ADHD and not AS.  The same doctor now wants to add the label, when if anything she has improved most of the behaviors since she was 5.

851,PDD-NOS,"
        Hello,
I'm not a doctor but I do have three sons who are on the autism spectrum.  My firstborn, who is now 17 years old, was first diagnosed with ADHD at the age of five.  I knew there was something more to that diagnosis because he would do things that even as a first time parent I knew it wasn't right.  He had incredible fears of flying insects and would run and hide under tables or complete run off from his classroom, he would never make eye contact, he responded to situations literally all the time, etc.  This was in 1995 when the dx of Asperger's was not that common.  I finally pushed enough and was sent to a psychiatrist with my son who knew immediately that he had Asperger's. 
To answer your question directly, you can have more than one diagnosis.  I believe the term to use is co-morbid (again I could be wrong but I believe that it is).  It means that you can have more than one dx.  That's the thing with autism (or lots of other dx's), you can have autism but have epilepsy (very true) or you can have autism and have ADHD (the hyper activity part especially for my sons).  My oldest, for example, has Asperger's Syndrome, epilepsy, ADHD (he's still on two meds for that), ODD (he picks his scalp to the point he has a hole in it), depression (very common in autism, as well as many other life altering dx), and finally insomnia (all three of my sons need meds to SLEEP).

As for the more services with the PDD-NOS dx, I don't know about that, my school district doesn't recognize that dx so my youngest (who b/c of many of dx - mainly he was born with a cleft lip and palate - has been given that dx b/c they don't know where exactly to place him on the spectrum) has not received more services because of that dx.  His dr gave him that dx for the same reason yours did - the only difference being we know he's on the spectrum, just don't know where.

Anyway sorry for my rambling reply - the bottom line is they can have more than one dx (in my humble opinion).

All the best,
Chezbug

852,Is my child autistic?,"
        I would suggest that you go try to identify a hospital in an urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children who present developmental delays/autism. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations. You can then take these recommendations to your local early intervention program. 

If your child does receive a diagnosis of autism, the most effective treatment for children with autism is early intensive behavioral intervention. This means that your son should receive 20 hours of direct teaching in language, social skills and self-help skills. Services can be provided by early intervention or private therapists in your area. You may want to look for behaviorally trained professionals to supervise a treatment program by checking www.bacb.com for a person in your area.

        just stopping by to send my sympathy towards your situation. my son is almost 18mos old and we've been wondering about autism as well. i really don’t have any suggestions since I’m new to this all, but his pediatrician did mention the hearing thing once (which is not a problem for my son), so as you mentioned that could have a lot to do with some problems your son is experiencing. Also, my son's dr mentioned that most times in autism the children aren't very emotional, etc. Which, from what you say you're son is a cuddle bug like mine (don't you love that?!) and smiles a lot. My son clapped his hands for a while, then stopped and wouldn't do it no matter what we did to try to get him to do it, then all of a sudden people were clapping on the radio and he started clapping! He also did this with high5's... he'd do it on command for a while, then decided he wouldn't do it anymore but sometimes decides to demand someone give him a high5. Also, you can yell my son's name a million time but he wont acknowledge you until he's good and ready... seems like he can't hear you or something, then all of a sudden I’ll get his attention...that i have heard is a good symptom of autism. I'd hang in there with going to a ton of specialists yet. Maybe your son is just a little later to develop with some stuff? (I know you probably hate hearing that, that's what everyone always tells me about my son and his speech). Children's behavior is so mysterious sometimes, I def know it can be stressful and worrisome. Sorry I don't have any advice, just letting you know I can relate to the worry something like this causes. Hang in there! And good luck! 

Also, have you taken any of the ""quizzes"" for autism? I found this one online, which is actually very similar to the test my son's pediatrician uses at pt's 18mo & 24mo exams routinely..... the MCHAT.....the site is.....

859,feces smearing,"
        In some cases, loose bowel movements or constipation contribute to fecal smearing. If this is the case, I recommend that you talk to your pediatrician about these issues. I suspect that your doctor would suggest dietary changes before medication. 

A child may also fecal smear because he/she has difficulty cleaning after bowel movements. In these cases it is important to patiently teach the child how to clean correctly. I also find that flushable wipes make the task easier.

Some children smear feces because they enjoy the sensation. In these cases, I recommend beginning with careful monitoring in the bathroom. Interrupt any attempts to touch or manipulate feces. You might also consider a reward system for clean bathroom trips. If your child is smearing feces at other times (e.g., in bed at night) it will be more difficult to supervise adequately. In these cases, I recommend checking on your child frequently and implementing a reward system for no fecal smearing. If the problem is consistent enough, you might also consider purchasing a cheap video monitor now available along side audio baby monitors in many stores. If it is an appropriate time, you might also consider offering you child an appropriate alternative source of stimulation (e.g., play dough) at the times that he usually smears. But, do not give your child something fun to do immediately after he smears.

Some children also learn that they get a big reaction from their parents when they smear feces. In order to avoid rewarding this behavior with attention, I recommend that you minimize your reaction as much as possible.

You must also decide whether to clean the mess yourself or have your child participate in the clean-up. The answer is that it depends. For some kids, participation in the clean up might provide an enjoyable type of attention that will actually reward the smearing. For other children, participating in the clean up would be a consequence that discourages fecal smearing.

864, extremely unruly 7 yr old boy,"
        Hi Jessadia,

It sounds like you are having a pretty difficult time with your son at home.  Before giving you any specific advice, I’d like to suggest that you try and obtain the help of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA), as they can provide you with professional help in assessing why he is showing these problem behaviors and how to safely reduce them.

It’s great that he is doing well as school compared to home, and that suggests that something is happening differently at school than at home. It may be helpful to set up a chance to observe him at school and/or talk to his teachers about what they do to address his behavior at school – both in terms of supporting good behavior as well as addressing problematic behavior.  You may be able to adapt some of their strategies to home.  In the meanwhile, I’d suggest that you continue to supervise him around other children and pets and implement consistent rules. 

In terms of your question about autism: there is no way to diagnose without seeing the child directly – I suggest you take him to see your pediatrician and explain your concerns.  A diagnosis of autism usually follows when the child shows a delay (or sometimes regression) in communication skills, limited interest in social contact, and possibly restricted interests or some repetitive movements (flapping hands, tapping, etc.).  Problem behavior like you described sometimes occurs in individuals with autism, but alone doesn’t mean your child has autism.

Finally, the question if medication is one that should be directed at your pediatrician.  Quite often, a BCBA can help you assess and reduce problem behavior without the use of behavior-altering medications, but if you feel that medication is appropriate, you should speak with your doctor. 

Best of luck to you,
Jessica

But, I do recommend that families share all developmental concerns with a qualified professional because it is vitally important to intervene early. An autism diagnosis is made based on delays in language and social development and the presence of repetitive behavior. I am a little concerned that her doctor suggested autism based on head size.

        9 months is early to determine the reason that she is not talking.  Does she look at you or anyone that calls her name? By this I mean: does she look and make eye contact when your call her name?  Does she play pick a boo, smile and look at your face/ eyes? does she clap? I am not an expert, but I read somewhere that the earliest test for autism is that the baby does not turn when you call out his or her name.  If the pediatrician is worried about autism, he should refer your sister to a child development specialist.  The earlier you start intervation for speech and social skills the better in the long run for the success of the child. Good luck.

        I would definitely recommend that you seek assistance for your daughter's vomiting and feeding difficulties. Many large hospitals in urban areas have pediatric feeding programs that offer assistance. As you noted, many feeding issues begin with medical problems (e.g., reflux) that make it uncomfortable for children to eat. Feeding is then complicated by behavioral issues in that the child is motivated to avoid eating and may learn to escape meals and other unpleasant events through tantrums and other forms of refusal. Comprehensive medical and behavioral interventions are highly successful in these cases. It may be good news that the school feels that your child is doing well. If there are signs that this is not true, you should continue to advocate for the services that your child needs. If it appears that she is doing well at school, it would be useful to get services for the problems that you are seeing at home and to figure out what may be promoting positive behavior at school. It is not uncommon for children to behavior very differently at home and school. This does not mean that teachers or caregivers are to blame for the behavioral difficulties. Good communication can increase the likelihood that both parties understand what is working and not working so that the child is best served.

        I am the mother of an 8 year old boy on the autistic spectrum.  He is high functioning and goes to a school that is a mixture of those on the spectrum and mainstream children.  He went to a mainstream only school to begin with and he wasn't diagnosed until he was 6, although I had raised a number of concerns from about age 3.
I've also gone over onto YouTube and have looked at your videos.
In my opinion she is showing autistic characteristics and also alot of sensory issues.
From your post I presume she has a diagnosis of PDD NOS?  What part of the diagnostic criteria for an autistic spectrum disorder did she fail on?
I am in the UK, and the definition of 'education' in the UK is not limited to just reading and writing.  It includes social interaction and play skills, life skills, emotional regulation and anxiety regulation etc.  
So, in short, I disagree with the school.
Is she in a mainstream school?
Just because a child is not showing inappropriate or disruptive behaviours, does not mean they don't have needs.  If your child cannot play with other children she has a need in that area that should be met with a programme from a speech and language therapist.  She should be going to a Social Skills Group, she should have adult support during playtimes and dinnertimes and she should be being taught how to initiate social interaction (as a starter) and play and the adult on the playground should be helping her to use the skills she has learnt on how to initiate from the SALT.  Those targets and how they will be met should be in her IEP, and it should be monitored and recorded how she is doing with this skills.  And that is just one aspect.
She is showing alot of sensory behaviour.  Covering her ears in the bathroom, making sure it doesn't involve a shower (many have tactile problems and showers may actually hurt them).  The bathroom has a different acoustics.  She vomits easily.  She flaps and spins.  She has a body movement she does rhythmically using her upper torso.  She should be assessed by an Occupational Therapist and a programme put into place on how to help her with these issues and what kind of environmental adaptation she needs to cope in school.  It maybe that in school she has less problems.  But she needs to be assessed for that to be certain and to ascertain what it is in the home or school environment that she likes or cannot cope with.
I would also recommend a book by a woman called Olga Bogdashina called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  There is a caregivers questionnaire at the back of it that you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.
As children typically find visual information helps them understand, you could make up a daily timetable for home which shows in picture form what she is going to do on that day.  As she is verbal start to ask her about what is upsetting her.  For example, in the bathroom, ask her ""is the noise from the water hurting your ears"", or ""does it hurt your skins when you have a shower"".  Whatever she tries to avoid ask her a direct question, not an open ended one.  Don't ask her 'why', she's too young and may not even know why herself.  She appears not to like soap, ask her ""does the smell of the soap bother you.""  ""does the soap make your skin feel itchy"". etc.  You might get some surprising answers.  But just believe whatever she says is a true experience for her.  I have sensory issues myself, and I am not on the spectrum.  But I have auditory processing difficulties, CAPD, touch oversensitivities (If someone touches me I can still feel it for minutes afterwards, some touch hurts), I cannot wear tags in clothes or wear man made fibres, I cannot bear certain smells to the extent that I will vomit or have to leave the building or bus.

        Sensory issues are different to OCD behaviour.  In OCD the person/child feels compelled to do certain rituals because they feel that something bad will happen if they don't do them.  With sensory issues we actually receive and translate the incoming sensory information differently.  So a child insisting on certain clothes (or tags removed) (or long sleeves/trousers) (or short sleeves/short trousers) (or must always wear shoes and socks) or (must never wear shores and socks) is not OCD if they want (or don't want) those clothes because the fabrics are tolerable (or intolerable) to them.
My son had some similar behaviours at around her age.  He used to vomit like a reflex action when he got anxious or upset.  It could happen in seconds.  It could be around me turning off the TV, or saying we were leaving the house, or telling him no.  It did stop just before he started school.  But up until then we had to try to distract him as soon as he started to gag, which sometimes included singing or clapping or dancing around!.  Mostly we just cleaned up the sick and changed him.  It happened that fast.
He very rarely flaps, but he did used to spin and run or walk round in circles.  He used to like ripping up newspaper.  He didn't line things up.  He did play with parts of things.  He was okay with changes in routine.  But he needed his expectations to be met, and if something was not as he expected it to be he would get upset and vomit or throw a tantrum.
He's now 8 and much much better.  Especially since I moved him to a school that has experience and expertise in autistic spectrum disorders.  I also got private reports and went to an Educational Tribunal and got every provision we have proved he needed.  
What you need are reports that actually give written evidence of what your daughter's needs are and what is recommended against those needs.  I found it impossible to get anyone in the education or health service willing to carry out any assessments.  I can only put that down to funding and the fact that the more needs they find the more money they have to allocate to your child.  
But there are eductional laws, and you would be wise to find out what any school is required to do by law to meet a child's needs.  
The school seem to be just looking for bad behaviour.  That isn't always the case.  I know of autistic children who just follow the rules at school (because  they love the routine), they get annoyed at other children making a noise or not paying attention.  They want to just sit and learn.  Yes they are model pupils, but it is because how autism affects them.  
My son isn't like that, he hates school, because he does find it a struggle.
Has your daughter been assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist?  She sounded quite verbal on the tape which is good.  However is her receptive speech as good as her expressive speech?  Is she a concrete literal thinker.  Can she hold two way conversations or does she give an unrelated answer to questions that are directed to her?  Does she have language processing delays or difficulties following verbal instructions?
If she has a diagnosis, and if you are happy with that ie. PDD NOS and not Autistic Spectrum Disorder.  Then you need to know exactly what her speech and language skills are as well as her social skills and play skills.  It maybe that she is okay academically in school, but does not know how to interact.  If that is the case the SALT needs to work on that area.  However, she may find academic stuff hard because as they get older they have to use learnt information and manipulate it to apply the concepts into different situations.  Many children struggle with that.  So she might do okay in the infant years, but start to struggle at around age 7+.  Can she read and write and understand numbers?  Has an educational pscyhologist assessed her cognitive ability and her emotional and anxiety regulation.  Can she recognise emotions in others.  Does she have one to one correspondence with numbers.  Is she learning the alphabet and phonics.  Is she motivated in the class.  
Sometimes children appear to cope in school, but bring all the anxiety/stress and frustration out at home.
If it was the other way round, ie. problems in school and perfect at home, how would school like you to refuse anything they suggested because she was okay in the home environment?
If school are refusing support, do you have reports made by the SALT and Educational Psychologist that names her needs and recommends how she should be supported.  Can you go back to her paediatrician and ask for a referal through health to a multi disciplinary team assessment?
You can also get private reports done.  If you do they are much more thorough, but they cost about £1500 per report.  If you do go down that route you want professionals who are independent and who don't work for the health or education services.  You want them to have experience of autistic spectrum disorders, and also experience of being called as expert witnesses at Educational Tribunals.  An independent professional will write a report that states what your child's needs are (irrespective of what is available in school).  Once you have written evidence of that need, by law (in the UK, at least), the school has to provide that level of support and if they don't have it the local educational authority has to fund that extra provision.

        Hi -
You should be happy that your child is doing so well.  The best for the child is to be integraded with other children without disabilities. She will learn from them.  I would just work closely with the teacher and make sure that all is going smoothly.  If not, you can always call an IEP meeting.  Maybe your daughter is out growing her issues.  There are children that in Pre- School show symptoms on the spectrum but will outgrow them.  Just work closely with the school and make sure that you understand how your child is performing.  How is she doing in Pre-school? does she behave? does she talk to other children?  I think that it is always in the best interest of the child with minor disabilites to be fully integrated in a regular classroom.  Later if she is having social issues you can always request that the school give her a social skills class. Good luck.

873,Preschool eligability under special needs denied today for child with PDD-NOS,"
        There are big disagreements around inclusion.  Some for, and some against.  If your daughter is on the spectrum that means that she DOESN'T learn from other children or family members.  That is what autism is.  Having said that, these children do have to be able to function in a world where most of the people are neuro typical.  And at primary level children are much more forgiving.
You say that she isn't playing with other children, and that is what it showed on the video you posted on you tube.  She is either unaware of other children, or does not know how to initiate and sustain play.  No matter how long she is with other children she will not learn these skills simply by being in close proximity to other children.  
I am not anti inclusion.  My son is in a school that is a mixture of those on the spectrum and mainstream children.  The best school I have ever been to was aspergers and high functioning autism only, but the chances of me getting my son in there are practically nil.
Other conditions or disorders do well in mainstream because those children learn in the same way even though they may be delayed etc.
Children on the spectrum are totally different and there is no evidence that being in a mainstream environment is of any benefit to them.  Infact as they get older and are self aware, they recognise that they are different and have difficulties but they don't know 'what' is different about them or 'how' they can bridge the gap.
As an adult, I know that my son will not be mixing with other mainstream adults because he isn't interested or motivated by the same things and he doesn't have the social skills or language skills for them to accept him even if he wanted to be part of that group.  He won't be going to pubs and clubs because of the sensory issues involved with that.
On a comparative level with other children on the spectrum your daughter may be doing well.  But her difficulties are not minor and the gap between her abilities and her peers will widen.  But, even if you consider only the social side of things, the school should be meeting that need and not fobbing you off.  It is the responsibility of the SALT and the school to meet those needs.  If you don't fight for it, it won't happen.  And a year down the line she will be showing no improvement in those areas and you will be a year behind in therapies.
Don't play the waiting game, that is what they want, it doesn't cost them money.  Get the supports and provision in place.  If she does develop and gain these skills and doesn't need the support and therapies anymore it can be withdrawn.
If they don't support her during playtime, and she is by herself and not joining in, then in what way is she being included?

874,Preschool eligability under special needs denied today for child with PDD-NOS,"
        Thank you for all your wonderful advice!!!  I should clarify, she has had no schooling thus far, no IEP yet.  She was at school for 3 days for her evaluation in an integrated classroom, but has not even been enrolled.  This was the pre-eligability meeting (we never even made it that far).  She was also denied for early intervention at 18 months and just got taken on (based on clinical judgement) at 34 months (so they will drop us too in 2 weeks when she turns 3).  She is diagnosed with PDD-NOS but bordering Aspergers (highest functioning possible just missing Neurotypical).  The school stated that she definitely has sensory problems when it comes to the videos, but in real life in the classroom, they didn't see the behaviors.  She tolerated the other children screaming, music, noise, etc.  She followed the rules, was a model student.  They said she could be acting differently in the classroom versus at home and in the world because she knows the reaction her parents will give her (which is a load of **** in my belief).  They said that while she made no attempt to initiate social interactions, she responded to others' attempts to make them with her.  They wrote in their report that my DD stated ""Hi.  My name is Jennifer."" to another child which I find very hard to beleive as neither I nor my husband have ever heard her say this to another child before.  They did say that she preferred to be around the teacher versus the other children (which I could have told them...she prefers adults). Jen wants to play and interact, she just doesn't know how and will stand there shyly and stick out her tongue and just stare at the child.  Very odd interactions when she does attempt but would rather just be next to others, but not interacting except with adults...she is wonderful with adults).  Not sure if it is because she can tell adults a story and they will respond as she expects.  I guess now that the school is saying ""it is basically the parents' leading the behaviors"", it is hard for me to say she is really experienceing sensory info this way, or is she just playing games with us to get a response?  When we ask her if she likes soap, she says Yes but the bathroom is too scary.  I ask if it is the noise, and she says that it is too noisy.  She also says she is scared of the pipes as a couple months ago, we had a pipe leak and needed the ceiling fixed from the leak.  Bathing was bad before this incident, but this made it much worse.  She also states ""the water is too hot"" but it is luke warm if that.  She prefers an ice bath and is obscessed with ice and cold items.  It is funny that you said that you experience some of these things, because I also have some sensory issues.  I can't touch boxes or rub my fingers on certain textures (feels like rubbing nails on a chalkboard).  I also lived on soup as a child, and this is the only thing my child will eat and pasta.  Like you, I am also neurotypical.   When your son was Jennie's age, how was his eating, sleeping?  Did he talk well?  My Jen's speech is wonderful, but it is more like she talks at us as a story, but can't do the give and take part of speech.  She is very literal.  Her doc's eval stated that she has pragmatic speech delays, social delays, anxieties. 

How you said that your son would vomit from the smallest thing, I completely relate.  It could be us telling her that we are going to the park, and she was shake and say, ""No, I want to stay home, I'm tired.""  Then shake and vomit.  I told the school this and they (the principal during the eligablity mtg) turned it around on me stating that ""well, she got her way right? It's behavioral.""  However, she was really scared and if I took her anyways with these anxieties, would I not be doingher even more psychological harm???

They don't have SALT here.  Just EI and Preschool.  I have her in swim classes to be around others, but she spends it clung to me and scared of every noise in the pool area.  The next step is to request an independent evaluation, but with the way this school treated me during this mtg, I really don't want my daughter attending there.  I am going on Mon to see if she will qualify for another school (Head Start)...hopefully this will be better, but they want the child potty trained, and that has been a whole other issue which is not going too well.  Thank you for all your info...

875,Preschool eligability under special needs denied today for child with PDD-NOS,"
        My sons language seemed to be developing and at around 2+ he was using one and two word combinations.  When he was 3+ his older sister was bought a TV for her bedroom with an inbuilt video player.  From the moment he saw his first video he would sit mezmorised by it, and after seeing it once or twice he would repeat the dialogue to himself and re-run the film in his head.  He is 8 now and still does that.  Some of his speech he has put together himself, but he struggles to find the correct words to express what he wants, and finds it easier sometimes to use a phrase or part of a dialogue from a film.  So he kind of puts his verbal speech together like a verbal jigsaw puzzle.  I can recognise from his speech what parts he has made up and what parts he has taken from somewhere else.  He also speaks with an American accent, and has an unusual intonation and emphasises the wrong sylabel in words sometimes.
He also tends to talk at you.  And it is very important to get her speech assessed because being able to talk is not an indication that everything is okay.  She needs her expressive and receptive language, her auditory processing and auditory memory and working memory to be assessed.
Google delayed echolalia and autism to see if that is relevant
Also google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder to see if that is relevant (if she has problems with pragmatics, then she probably has difficulties with semantics, and if she has both she probably has semantic pragmatic speech disorder).  In the UK the different between a delay and a disorder is that with a delay there is the possibility that the child will learn and catch up.  A disorder is for life.  So, with the diagnosis of a speech disorder your child cannot be discharged from SALT.
It is also very common for children to behave differently in different environments.  She does have some auditory sensitivities, and those seem to be around the acoustics associated with bathrooms, swimming pools etc.
I'm glad your've not impressed with the school.  You need a school that has experience of teaching children on the spectrum.  You need to be understood when you talk about your child and not be accused of things, or looked at like you are mad, or ignored.
If you get a multi disciplinary team assessment through health you can ask for a referal to a centre that has experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders including aspergers.  There might be a wait, but it would be worth it to get a proper insight.
In the meantime, find out about all your local schools and which ones have experience.  Go and visit them and talk with them about entry criteria.  If it is a mixed special needs and mainstream you maybe able to get a mainstream place without a diagnosis at this point.  
Does your child ever appear deaf when you call her name, or does she appear not to feel touch sensations, etc.  I found with my son that he doesn't misbehave in class, but he tends to shut down some of his sensory systems to cope with the classroom environment.  Many people on the spectrum do this automatically as a way of reducing incoming stimulous.  So, I too had to fight for his needs to be recognised and met because they couldn't see what his difficulties were.  But in the classroom if he shuts down his hearing he cannot hear what the teacher is saying, so how can he follow her instructions etc.
To get support you have to tease out and identify every need because even with a diagnosis of aspergers or autistic spectrum disorder in the UK that doesn't automatically entitle you to extra support and services.  And I found that the school professionals and health professionals did not want to do assessments because it costs them money to do them and anything they find means they have to find the staffing levels and money to meet that support.
Do you have an equivalent of the National Autistic Society in America?  If so contact them and get some local information and advice.  
There are solicitors who specialise in special needs law.  I had to resort to one in the end.  It cost me a new kitchen (which I had save up for!), but it has been more than worth it in the amount of money I know my son is receiving in therapies and supports in school. 
But if you take that route, make sure you follow my instructions re independent professionals, and try to time it right so that you get the best benefit because you cannot afford to keep spending that amount of money.
Find out about your education system and your child's legal rights.  It might be worth paying for a couple of hours advice from a specialist solicitor so that you know what you can do.  
Don't believe what anyone in the school or health professionals tell you.  It is hard to believe, but they do lie and they do threaten and they do refuse you access to supports your child has a right to.
Make sure that you put every request to anyone in writing, and always keep copies, and always get their response in writing.

876,Preschool eligability under special needs denied today for child with PDD-NOS,"
        At my son's previous school (he was mainstream only for 3 years), the headmistress told me that ""we cannot change all the systems in the school just for your son"".  I asked her to put that in writing and she did.  So I had evidence that she was refusing to meet my son's needs (which is illegal), and by refusing to differentiate work and make the environment autism friendly he was 'excluded' and not 'included'.
I moved him to another school this September eventhough the educational authority threatened me and said they would put him in a mainstream only classroom with no supports (ie. they tried to scare me into keeping him where he was).  So I moved him anyway and dared them not to support him or withdraw his placement as that would be illegal too under Disability Discrimination Law.
Why do we have to do this???  Don't we have enough on our plates anyway.  It is very unfortunate that you find yourself in these confrontational situations, but you are the advocate for your daughter.
Your videos were very good.  They are good evidence.  Always check with professionals what they are assessing for and what they have found and what they recommend.  For example, after three years I asked the SALT what the heading ""social and behavioural assessments"" meant because on their standardised forms, in three years, this heading always said ""on this occasion we did not have the opportunity to assess him"".  She explained that this section was about Social Interaction and Play Skills.  So I wrote a letter of complaint and asked why a child with a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder, which as part of the diagnostic criteria has to have difficulties with both language and social interaction and play skills, had never been assessed or supported in those areas?  I requested a SALT with experience of autistic spectrum disorders, and I insisted that they put together a social communication and interaction programme for him and that the school supported him during playtimes and breaktimes.  
In the end I was hitting my head against a brick wall, so I called in private reports, got a solicitor and went to court and won.  And my son is high functioning autistic.  He too wants to play with children, and now is doing much better.  But he needs supporting, and will probably always need supporting during his school years.
Don't be afraid to complain.  Don't be afraid to ask professionals to explain themselves to you in writing and to justify what they have/haven't done.  
Your daughter might benefit from a listening therapy.  My son is doing one at the moment called Listening With the Whole Body.  His Occupational Therapist has been trained in this.  Again, I got that therapy because the private reports stated he had auditory processing and auditory memory problems, as well as auditory processing disorder - he also has sensory integration disorder.  So I went to my GP and said that my son had a medically recognised disorder which the health service could not assess for or treat and that I had found a clinic in London UK that did a listening therapy that had proven clinical evidence that it caused improvements.  My GP agreed to put in an application to fund this treatment.  Lo and behold, a couple of months later I am approached by the community OT team who have been instructed by the health care trust to begain this therapy on him.  No other child in his school gets this therapy.  So, those that ask get.  It would have been impossible for the hospital trust to justify turning my son down for this treatment because he has the medical condition.  And it is not my son's fault that they don't have the facilities or specialists in our city to meet those needs.
Regarding potty training, my son was out of nappies at 3 years.  Fortunately we haven't had many of the typical problems others have with that.  
My son has always responded to other childrens attempts to play with him.  But he didn't know how to initiate it himself.  And frequently he could sustain play.  When he was younger he wanted to re-enact things and other children would not comply and say the same words and do the same movements he required.  He also found it hard to follow their spontaneous imaginative play.  If the children were playing together and then got up and ran off to another part of the playground my son would not automatically get up and follow them, he would stay where he was.  He frequently gets sidetracked whilst playing ie. something within the game will interest him and he will focus on that and become oblivious to what the other children are doing.
But at 8 he has made incredible progress.  He is very observant and clever.  He tends to watch and absorb information and put it together himself.  Then he will come out with a statement such as ""humans cannot fly because they are too heavy and gravity pulls them to the earth"".  
So I would go back and get an assessment of her social interaction and play skills.  Why can't you get access to a SALT.  They are the professionals that cover this area.
Look around at more suitable schools.
Find out about your education system.
Get in touch with national organisations and local support groups.  Get clued up.
Start collecting written evidence and learning about the different aspects of her difficulties and how they affect her and then write to the responsible professional for them to tell you how they will meet that need your daughter has.
If, after some time, you are not making progress and are not happy with her progress in school, or are denied access to the school you think is appropriate because of their entry criteria or lack of places etc.  Then get a solicitor involved.
I would also recommend you read the book I mentioned by Olga Bogdashina.
I took me over 2 years to get my son diagnosed (from 4 to 6 years old), and it took another 2 years on top of that (6-8) for all of the difficulties I recognised to be confirmed by professionals (in private reports), and for those needs to be supported in school.  And I was fobbed off by doctors, health care workers, nursery etc from the age of 3+ because they all told me to wait and see how he develops and that any issues would be raised when he started school.  But that meant he missed out on a years worth or professional input.  It also meant he had to go to a mainstream primary school because the education system did not know that he had any special needs.  That first school failed him terribly, and we are still playing catch up now.  He still isn't reading or writing and is suspected of having dyslexia.  Yet he has higher than average cognitive ability.  
I am now continuing to gather all evidence because I don't know what the schooling options will be for him at 11+.  At that age many children are forced back into mainstream only school due to lack of places.  Again this is illegal, but the education authority still does it and only backtracks with those parents that threaten legal action.

        Regarding my son's eating.  He would totally refuse certain textures such as peas, beans etc.  He gagged and vomited easily.  He sometimes over ate and vomited.  He eats a broad range of food, and recently is trying and eating new foods.  He won't eat foods that are a mixture of textures such as pieces or chunky soups.  He likes each food item to be separate and recognisable for what it is.
Regarding sleep.  He gets scared at night time.  Actually, even in the day he won't go upstairs unless accompanied by an adult and with all the lights on.  Sometimes he sleeps in his bedroom with the light on.  On those nights he usually wakes up in the middle of the night and comes into our bed.  But most nights he either sleeps with his dad or with me.  He finds it hard to get to sleep at night, and in the morning he is still tired and finds it hard to get up.  Then we usually have refusal to go to school and anxiety and tears about that.  Once he is there he is usually okay, although he does have meltdowns and tantrums there.
What I have found out many times about autism.  Is that is isn't that the child cannot do certain things eg. theory of mind, or social interaction etc.  It is the fact that they cannot process the information quick enough and make the correct connections between information or situations to be able to apply it at the time necessary.  My son is capable of watching a film and explaining why the child is unhappy or what they are thinking.  However, in the real world we don't view it on a TV screen.  Things happen out of our view or are said and we don't hear them.  He needs all of the information presented to him literally for him to grasp it.  So they do have emotions, and empathy, and social understanding, and theory of mind etc - but not as we do.

        In the UK we have Statements which are documents that are legally binding.  We also have IEPs in school which are reviewed on a termly basis.  I have taken the following information about IEPs for you to print off, read and keep.  It is very important for IEPs to be specific because that is how you know if your daugher is achieving targets and making progress.  If it is badly written you won't know what, if anything, is being achieved and you won't have any evidence that she needs extra input or supports.

""Goals are all part of writing the Individualized Education Plan-Program (IEP). More importantly, writing good goals that meet the specific child's need are critical to the process. A large number of educational jurisdictions tend to use SMART goals which stand for:
Specific
Measurable
Achievable
Relevant
Time Limited
Using SMART goals makes a lot of sense when writing your IEP goals. After all, well written goals will describe what the child will do, when and how he'll do it and what the time frame will be for achieving it.
When writing goals, keep the following tips in mind:

Be very specific about the action. For instance: raise his/her hand for attention, use a classroom voice, read the pre-primer Dolch Words, complete homework, keep hands to him/herself, point to I want, I need augmentative symbols.

Then you need to provide a time frame or location/context for the goal. For instance: during silent reading time, while in the gym, at recess time, by the end of 2nd term, point to 3 picture symbols when something is needed.

Then decide what determines the success of the goal. For instance:how many consecutive periods will the child remain on task? How many gym periods? How fluent will the child read the words - without hesitation and prompting? What percentage of accuracy? How often?

What to Avoid

A vague, broad or general goal is unacceptable in the IEP. Goals that state will improve reading ability, will improve his/her behavior, will do better in math should be stated much more specifically with reading levels or benchmarks, or frequency or level of improvement to attain and a time frame for when the improvement will occur. Using ""will improve his/her behavior'is also not specific. Although you may want behavior improved, which specific behaviors are targeted first along with when and how are a critial part of the goal.

If you can remember the meaning behind the acronym SMART, you will be prompted to write better goals that will lead to student improvement. It's also a good practice to include the child in setting goals if appropriate. This will ensure that the student takes ownership over reaching his/her goals. Make sure you review goals regularly. Goals will need to be reviewed to ensure that the goal is 'achievable'. Setting a goal too high is almost as bad as not having a goal at all.

Some Final Tips:

Include any curricular modifications. If the curriculum states that the goal is to count to 50 and you state count to 10, this is a modification.
Include any curricular accommodations. This will include things like: scribing, a quite setting to take tests, assistive technology etc.
Provide any support staff that will be involved in the IEP
Indicate materials and or resources to be used
Most importantly, make sure the IEP is based on priorities for the student.
Try the following sample goals:
Behavior Goals
Written Comprehension
Self Esteem Goals
ADD Goals""

Also, whatever the target is, they need the child to be able to demonstrate it between 75-100% (100% is a better specific target) of the time for it to be proven that they have learnt it.  Then if they lose that ability you know that they are learning and losing skills (which is a common autistic characteristic).  If you only require a 50% success rate, you never know if the item in question was ever learnt.

        I think they switched our children at birth...LOL...you're talks with an American accent and mine talks with an English accent!!!!! That is too funny...She says ""Mommy...I cannot do this."" saying the word ""cannot out loud"".  From what I am reading out children sound so much alike.  Mine too is mesmerized by movies such as Elvis Presley, Wizard of Oz, old fashioned musicals and will sit and watch over and over again as if it is the first time.  She learns the words as well and you can hear it in her everyday language (some her own speech, some what others have said before, and some from tv all pieced together)...funny exact same thing you are describing.  It makes her sound brilliant to the person who doesn't know where she is getting the info, but I know where the words are from.  My DD also talks at people...very similar to yours....AMAZING!  Sounds like your son is soooo similar to my DD!  I went today to a couple preschool and have been calling her GI and developmental doctors to alert them.  I also called today for an Advocate which is a free service to assist parents in getting services for children with disabilities.  I have been a busy bee today.

I was reading about your fight for services and I admire how you have been able to really advocate for your son's needs.  I am not usually as vocal, so I have been thinking that maybe the Lord meant for this to give my DD's mom a voice.  I hate confrontation so this must be my test to fight for my DD.  I am going to fight for her as I know that without services, she may get worse and I don't want that for her.

        I too hate confrontation.  But they sent me in circles for years until I could have quite happily collapsed in a heap of tears and just banged my head on the wall!
What turned me round, and made me so angry I nearly hit someone.  Was two people came to my house from the local education authority to persuade me not to move my daughter to the specialist school he is in now.  They told me that because children on the autistic spectrum need extra support and can get upset easily, that adding just one more child into that classroom would have a detrimental effect on the other children.  But they were quite happy to exclude my son and weren't at all worried about the detrimental effect that was having on his education, self esteem and his future prospects.  So I phoned a specialist solicitor and got the ball rolling.  I felt that I had gone as far as I could with the information I had at that time.  Now I have been to an educational tribunal, I would be prepared to go again on my own if necessary.  Last week I even had a meeting with the Head of Special Needs Services at my local Council.  Progress is slow.  But every parent in area Town and City that makes a stand for their child, improves the overall services for the children in that area.  If enough parents in a school are getting input from a SALT and Ed Psych, then it would become cost effective for those professionals to be permanently based in that school.  If we get our children on every waiting list applicable to them (regardless of waiting times), it will mean that staffing provision will have to be put into place to meet those needs.
As your daughter also uses words from TV etc google Delayed Echolalia and Autism.  This is a different way that some children on the autistic spectrum learn to speak.  A SALT experienced with autistic spectrum disorders would know about this.  The fact that she has an English accent shows that she has picked it up and copied it from TV.  My son uses alot of USA terminology ie. ""common you guys"" (we don't use the term 'guys' in the UK).
Once you begin to identify, and list the areas of difficulty you think she has you can specifically ask the relevant professional (always in writing) to assess for ""echolalia, strange dialect or intonation of voice"".
As she gets older you may want her assessed for ""Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder"".  And, as previously stated, in the UK if a child has a speech disorder they cannot be discharged from SALT throughout their school years.
With the difficulties you have described a SALT should be involved.  Her expressive language maybe well above her receptive language.  She also probably has literal interpretation of language.
Good luck with the advocate.
Just remember to start teasing out and identifying her needs.  Then when you write for her to be assessed in these areas, or question how they will support your daughters difficulties of X, Y and Z, they have to respond.  If they ignore you that is evidence, if they deny you supports that is evidence, if they under support her that is evidence, if they support her and she doesn't make a full years academic progress that is evidence.  It is a slow step by step process, but it does all add up and eventually you will have enough evidence for her to get the supports she needs at the level she needs it.

        I am sorry you are having such a hard time.  Usually, in the States, it is easier on the pre-school level.   Honestly, in NYC I knew parents that faked a disabled cild to get free pre-school.  I really don't understand how you got all of these doctor reports and still did not qualify for any services.  Perhaps you need an advocate - because it seems like this school isn't telling you all your rights.  You need to go to your state's websites and find out who/what your rights are.   My son is borderline too - and honestly at that age I didn't get anything for him because he was muddling through.  There is a big wait and see thing going on.  We took care of it privately (which is pretty expensive) until his problems interfered with his school work.  The fact that your child is 3 and is still in diapers already indicates that they are a bit lagging.  Kudos for finding a school that allows it.  

If you qualify for Head Start then you probably can find an advocate who will help you on a sliding scale.  Every state has to provide a public advocate service and they are less expensive than the private ones.  Also, some of the private schools work with advocates who charge a substantially lower fee.  

My daughters had a kid in their preschool who used to upchuck any real food every time she ate - but magically could keep down potato chips and cheese doodles.  The teachers viewed it as a control issue to get more chips - so sometimes teachers read their own feelings into it.  Just remember you are dealing with a professon that has the lowest SAT scores of any licensed group.  Furthemore teachers who have scored elementary education degrees also have the lowest critical thinking skills of any college major.  This knowledge really helped us deal with them on a psychological level - all of a sudden the professional was no longer very insightful or intimidating.  

Be happy that your child is functioning in school.  Sam buried many a preschool director/teacher.  He then grew up to bury a principal or two.  You should be happy no one is politely asking you to pack up your urchin (and I mean public school) and handing you a letter telling you to go find any private school and they will happily foot the bill - just get him the hell out of their sight.

        Hi, I just watched all of your videos on youtube. She is precious. Bless your heart, I know this is rough. Alot looked very similar to my son. He is autistic. Also alot of sensory. I have never even heard or seen anyone else vomit at mealtime, like he does, until I watched your little girl. She looks as though she does have sensory issues. You really need to get help and not wait. She seems very bright with her language, but alot of sensory can be very frightening to them. Hang in there, it does get better. We actually took our boy to the feeding encouragement program at Kluge Childrens rehabilitaion center in va. Of course we live in va. But I encourage you to look up a feeding program for sensory issues on the web in your area. He was doing great, We actually taught him for years if he gagged go ahead and spit his food out before he vomited. Well he did this at school and low and behold one of his aides told him to not do that uit was disgusting. So now he has regressed and we are working with another feeding specialist. Dont you just love the school systems. All those years of hard work with him, BAM down the tube. Oh and I very much expressed how I felt to the school, but do you think they give a rats @#$, sorry I tend to still get a little bent out of shape over that one, dont give up .I personally know its hard, but you will get there.

        Hi there,
    I read your post and I really apreciate the info.  I have a meeting scheduled with the school for this upcoming week and my very vocal and persuasive mother in law will be going with me this time (lol...breaking out the MIL).  I am definitely going to look up feeding programs for sensory as you suggested...the feeding team she has right now is more medically focused...she is having an upper GI next month to monitor damage to her esophagus.  Poor kid...  Thank you for suggesting the spitting the food out before she gaggs...we just started doing that and soooooo much better!  If it hits the back of her gag reflex though, there is no stopping it...but for the initial textures that she feels when she gets the first bite, spitting has helped a lot!  Any suggestions on potty traning issues?  We are no where near potty training and she does it all over the house!  She doesn't understand not to go in her underwear.  I have a potty in the living room as she is petrified of the bathroom.  We keep prompting her to go every 5-10 mins and she says she doesn't have to...but she will go every 10 mins if you sit her on the potty each time she does go.  Also, she just started becomming hyperactive and uncontrollable (partly regular 3 year old) and she began hitting people this month which she has never done before.

        I also taught my son to try food and that it was okay to spit it on a paper napkin if he thought he was going to vomit.  This also worked for us.  Thankfully he then grew out of this at about the same time he started school.  Otherwise I am sure he would have got told off for doing that in school.  But it is a sensory thing, and also a reflex action.  Then it also gets associated with anxiety etc.  So, by telling him I wanted him to taste, but that it was okay to get it out his mouth fast, he became much more able to try stuff.  We started with just sniffing and touching food with the tip of his tongue, then just putting it in his mouth etc.  There are still certain food types and textures that he cannot bear, but his overall food intake is very good and is from a wide range of food.  He now even eats cabbage and brussels!  But he still cannot tolerate baked beans, peas, sweetcorn etc.
And I also worked on teaching him how to swallow vitamin tablets, because I knew that we would have huge difficulties with medicine.  He had liquid antibiotics once and just vomited it back up every single time.  I spoke with the doctor about it and he was just not understanding at all and told me 'you have to get it down him'.  Well, I did eventually find a way.  I mixed it in with hot chocolate milk and he drank it.  But after that we worked on tablets, and he can now swallow tablets okay.  So if he ever needs any kind of medication in the future I know he should be able to manage it.
So it is possible.  Just lots of encouragement, small steps and a get out clause (ie. spit it out) to reduce anxiety.

        A number of other things I have noticed about my son regarding food, which might be relevant is:-
(a) anxiety over different labels, where it was in the supermarket shelf (if it moved place), if the packaging or name has been changed.
(b) when on holiday he will eat food he will not touch at home.  And some familar food he appears not to recognise.  Quite bizzare really.  At home he likes fish fingers and likes blackcurrent juice to drink.  On one holiday he really didn't appear to know what this food was and was starting to get quite anxious about it.  I can only assume he in some way recognises the food by the environment it is in and not just by the look and smell of it.
The above examples are things that happened when he was younger ie. 4-6 years old.  I haven't had anything similar since.  Apart from a change in food naming causing an absolute meltdown in the middle of a cafe.  We went to order chicken nuggets and were told they were now called chicken chunks.  He didn't like that!  So he said okay i'll have fish fingers.  And we were then told they aren't called fish fingers anymore they are called fish nuggets.  Well all hell broke loose with him kicking and screaming on the floor.
But I think that all of the above is down to sensory, perceptual and language difficulties.

        it is just important to make sure everyone (at home and nursery/school is aware of your daughter using this strategy and that they MUST NOT say anything negative to her about it.  For most people it is a bit disconcerting to see a child frequently spitting out food.  But she can be taught to do it quite discreetly as she gets older and the important thing is that she becomes more confident in 'trying' textures and feeling 'confident' that she can remove them without gagging or vomiting.  You may well find that over time (years), her variety of food consumption will broaden.  Today my son ate some bread with sesame seeds on.  That is a first.  Usually bread cannot have any other texture/seed or grain in it or on it.
You can also encourage her to touch, squash and sniff food without any pressure to eat it or even put it in her mouth.  But that is usually for even more severe cases where childrens variety of food is severely limited to just a couple of items.

        The only other thing I can think of is that smell is closely tied in with taste.  Infact when you have no sense of smell you have no sense of taste.  Therefore it maybe that your daughter has an oversensitive sense of smell.  So you can help reduce the overall sensory load by reducing any perfum and chemical cleaners in the house.  Try to use natural stuff.  It usually works better and is cheaper eg. vinegar and lemon juice.  No air freshener sprays etc.  Let her smell products and tell you if she likes them eg. soap and shampoo.  If there are any she cannot tolerate then get rid of them.
My son used to gag and run away if he smelt mushy peas.  Once we were in a restaurant and someone near us had them on their plate and my son kept trying to escape outside.

        Hi,
   So glad this is working. I know it ia a slow process, but once they understand that YOU understand what they are going through it seems to slowly get better. As far as what other people think, THEY CANGET OVER IT!! They have NO CLUE what you or your child has been ,is, and will go through!! my sons diet has fluctuated back and forth. Its definitely alot more than what it used to be, but he can communicate to me what he wants and now I try to let him make those choices. There are times I say oh please just try it. He refuses ex: broccoli, but at school his peers talk him into it then he tries it and loves it!! But there are still times of gagging and vomiting. You are definitely right do go the medical way first,(tests for reflux and et.), but if they say shes fine and dismisses it dont stop get her the help she needs while she is young. You will be sooo glad you did. My son is 10 and still has issues, somedays more than others, but I have seen him make incredible strides over the years and I fully believe with everything in me if we did not seek out so much help for him and fight every step of the way, he would have never come this far. Thanks God for the push and willpower he put in me for my childs sake. He is truly amazing. I could not imagine my life without him. Also I wanted to mention my son has to have plenty to drink while he is eating. It just helps him to wash it down. I have noticed if it gets stuck in his teeth he will gag. Although we constantly have to say thats enough to drink, get a bite, because thet will definitely substitute drink for food. As far as potty training, I tried probably 5 different times over the course of 2 to 3 YEARS. I thought okay this is not going to happen and it didnt until he was 5 yrs, old. Then I tried again and bam this time he got it and took off with it. Has done wonderful ever since. Please dont listen to everyone ""Oh she should be pottied by now"" Please people mind your own business. She WILL get it (only in her time ), no one elses.Good luck and Im glad the spitting is helping. My boy had to eat ALL pureed food and baby food until he was 4 yrs. old. Now he eats macaroni and cheese, spagetti, omelets, hamburgers, chicken nuggets, loves carrots and green beans, cut up apples (no peelings of course), watermelon, used to ve alot more until the bread ended. Take care.

891,Could my child be misdiognosed???,"
        As your post recognizes, Asperger's is characterized by social impairment. Repetitive or stereotyped patterns of behavior are also required. In Asperger's, this second category typically involves strong preoccupations with a particular topic or area of interest. Your description did not mention any such preoccupations. The DSM-IV-TR, the manual that guides diagnosis, indicates that many individuals with Asperger's initially receive a diagnosis of ADHD. I think it would be worthwhile to have your son evaluated to be sure that he is receiving the amount and type of support that he needs. Whether or not he receives a diagnosis, it will be important for you and your son's school to work with him on his social issues.

        You can ask your GP for a referal to a multi disciplinary team that has experience of diagnosing Aspergers.  But for Aspergers he must have had typical language development.  You can also google DSM IV for the diagnostic criteria and see if that sounds relevant.
Alot of what you describe is Sensory Integration Disorder.  That can be a diagnosis in itself, but also accompanies autistic spectrum disorders including aspergers.  
A book that I found very useful was by a woman called Olga Bogdashina called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  This will explain more about how they perceive sensory information differently.  Alot of people recommend Tony Attwood books regarding Aspergers because they are easy to read.
I'm not sure about him being afraid of the neighbours boys.  Have they bullied him or teased him in the past?  Or he might have been anxious about this unexpected meeting in the streets and tried to avoid it.

        Asperger's Disorder is diagnosed based on impairments in social interaction and the presence of repetitive behavior patterns and restricted interests or activities. An inflexible adherence to routines or rituals falls into the second category as do intense or highly focused interests. Also, Asperger's is diagnosed when there are no significant delays in language or cognitive development. It is not uncommon for children with Asperger's to perform well academically, although they struggle with social interaction. I recommend that you seek an evaluation by a professional with exppertise in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders.

897,signs of aspergers,"
        If you google Temple Grandin (you probably have heard of her), and read her experiences of sensory perceptual difficulties, you will see that she says that she believes all those on the spectrum have sensory perceptual differences ranging from mild to severe.
These difficulties are ususally called Sensory Integration Disorder and it is an OT who would assess and put together a programme.  However OTs understanding of what is going on is somewhat limited.  There are autistic and aspergers people writing about it themselves eg. www. donnawilliams.net.  And there are professionals working with them to discuss these difficulties ie. Olga Bogdashina.  
These types of sensory issues are not new.  They were raised back in the 1960's by Delacatto who did a number of studies into how sensory information was perceived.
It is possible to have Sensory Integration Disorder without autism or aspergers.  But I haven't met anyone on the spectrum who didn't have some sensory issues.
I have some sensory processing difficulties, but I am not autistic.  My difficulties are around tactile (clothes, tags, fabrics etc - and feeling touch as painful), over sensitive smell, auditory processing problems (CAPD), poor balance.  But it fluctuates.  So I have good days and bad days.
Why would school think she cannot have aspergers because she is ahead of her peers academically?  There is a whole range of intelligence levels for those on the spectrum as in the typical population.  Even Einstein is suspected of having autistic traits.
You can also google the DSM IV diagnostic criteria for autism and aspergers and see yourself what the characteristics are.
I presume she does have a diagnosis?  It is always better to get a diagnosis through Health rather than through just school, and you need a multi disciplinary team to assess her that has experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders, including aspergers.  This should involve a Speech and Language Therapist (to assess language and social interaction and play skills), and an Educational/Clinical Psychologist as well as a Paediatrician.
The only real difference between ASD and Aspergers appears to be the requirement that the child acquited typical language development in Aspergers.  However even if they do have typical language (expressive), they still need to be assessed because their receptive language may be at a totally different level.  They may have problems with processing language or CAPD, or auditory or working memory problems.  They sometimes have Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder (literal and concrete thinking).

Your daughter appears to have SID, sensory intergration disorder which is common in people with autism.  I have to wear V-neck shirts and short sleeves, no jewellery-watches etc on my body and would get cane most days at school for wearing thongs-hated shoes.  I have spoken to absolute intellectual genius' Aspergers people, unfortunately they have the social IQ of idiots.  I'm not so lucky, I have learinng difficulties in visual spacial intergration, a wasted above average IQ and social idiot.

Have your daughter assessed by a clinician who specialises in Aspergers, a neuropsych assessment should put things into perspective.  

I have an aversion to manufactures tags, denim jeans as a child and certain loud noises. 

Mongrave's post is informative, Clinical psychologists who specialise in Aspergers is the way to go.  Run a mile from psychiatrists, they only wish to medicate excessively, that is all they know.  Some autism activist are anti-CBT and mainstream therapy for autism(We can't change attitude).  I'm not as it has assisted me in managing life and understanding appropriate behaviour.

        If Springfield Elementary also had a University, I am sure that they would have had a Post Grad course on ""how to recognise an autistic spectrum disorder"" as many professionals appear to have attended!
And regarding concrete and literal thinking, it is often the case that the NT medical/education professionals seems to be affected with this autistic trait.

Regarding your visual perceptual differences.  Have you ever tried Irlen lenses.  I have heard of a number of people with sensory issues being helped with these.  Donna Williams used to see fragments of objects etc, but when using the lenses she said that she saw objects and people 'whole' for the first time.

        ""I am sure that they would have had a Post Grad course on ""how to recognise an autistic spectrum disorder"" as many professionals appear to have attended""! 

Not quite sure what you saying, but if you believe a person who completes a degree can recognise an autism spectrum disorder you are delusional.  I interact and speak to many people on the spectrum and their parents.  The problem appears to be there a re very few trained diagnosticiains in the autisn spectrum disorder field.  Most medical poratitioners are looking for autistic disorder with arm flapping, rocking, unable to maintain eye contact and head banging onto walls. 

I have been assessed for Irlene's coloured lenses, not the issue.  Visual-Spatial-Orientation integration problems, with inability to form visual images:  I have no imagination or perception of abstract concepts.

I have read much of what Donna Williams has to say and Temple Grandin.  Definitely agree with there notion of not excepting bad behaviour.  Temple's coments and perceptions are interesting except you will not find subject on autism sex/sexuality.  She would appear to be asexual and that is only half of us on the spectrum.

I agree with your comments in relation to medical professional having autistic like personalities, especially the specialist-with exception to the psychiatrists.lol  How many complaints do we hear of specialist medical Drs bedside manners.  I do not have a problem with their attitude, the less chit chat the better.

        Hello, 
       I believe it is best to seek professional help for your child outside of school. My son was labeled ""developmentally delayed"" until he was diagnosed with moderate autism at the age of 4. His special ed preschool teacher said there was no way he was autistic, but we continued to get him the help he needed and eventually they agreed. He is 10 now and does wonderful. He just started to read and although he is behind in some areas he is an extremely happy little boy and makes us (his parents) extremely happy as well. He does have alot os sensory issues. He gags on most foods, cannot tolerate long sleeves, used to hold his hands over his ears from loud sounds(not so much anymore), has problems with tactile and body awareness. He receives ot pt and speech bith in and out of school. I never trust the school with anything. Sad to say it has been a CONSTANT battle with my sons school every single year and i have to feep fighting every step of the way. It gets old and frustrating but I have gotten pretty good at it. hope all goes well for you. Your in our prayers.

        Did you ask the parents about the way that she is?  please be aware that it is very difficult to come from a small Mexican village to a big USA environment.   Maybe she is having a hard time adjusting? Children in small villages of less developed countries do not develop as fast as the kids here in the USA or England.   Talk to her parents about how she does versus the children in her village.  Do the parents state to you that they worry about her behavior and development in hr village?  Maybe this is the way that she is and the way her small village is.  I was in the same situation as a 13 year old that came to this country in 1978 and placed in a big Southern California city.  Within 3 to 5 years, I had adjusted and ended up going to UCLA to obyain a Master degree (without any intervation).  Also if she is always going to live in her small city in Mexico, maybe they can not affort to go to Mexico City for help or any other city.  In less developed coutries, it is very hard to travel and get the help for the child. I am trying express that if she has someting very mild, it is better to not open Pandora's Box if she is always going to live in her small village and maybe she is fine given that she is from a small village.  Her parents know best and know her best.  Good luck and God bless her.

It is possible that your son's medications could be decreased if the proper behavioral support was in place. Be sure to immediately alert your son's psychiatrist/pediatrician to the side effects that you are observing. If you are concerned that your doctor is over prescribing, seek another opinion.

        Early intervention is important for all forms of developmental delay. So, it is important for your cousin to have a developmental assessment done as soon as possible, if she has not been evaluated already. Autism is diagnosed when there are delays in social and language development and when the child shows repetitive behavior. However, repetitive behavior (like the rubbing you describe) also occurs frequently with other forms of developmental disabiility. From your description, your cousin certainly sounds as though she would be eligible for physical therapy and speech and language services.

        I would encourage you to be in close communication with you son's school. First, you may need to advocate for more of different services or accomodations for your son at school. If you don't feel that your son's school is supporting him to the extent that he is making progress and feeling successful, you should advocate for some changes. At the same time, I think it is great that you are making yourself part of the solution by working with your son at home. But, you shouldn't feel that your son's academic success relies solely or primarily on what you do at home. Also, your work with him at home is likely to be most helpful if it is matched to his school curriculum, so it would be best to use his school as a resource. If your son has not been formally diagnosed I would encourage you to have him evaluated so that he is eligible for the services that he needs.

        I completely understand. My 12 yr old son was diagnosed 5 mths ago with Asperger's Syndrome. It had been suggested to me over the years to get him tested but I thought my son was fine and would grow out of his odd behaviors. It wasnt until last year when I went back to school to be a nurse that I really started to realize through my training that my son had an autistic spectrum disorder. The treatment that seems to work the best for Aspie kids usually envolves a behavior analyst. The best thing you can do for your soon is to have him get an actual diagnosis rather than just a self diagnosis. With a diagnosis it will open up doors for him to recieve additional services from schools and medical professionals such as special schools and more intense interventions. It is our job as parents to be our childs advocate. If you get your son a diagnosis the school will be required to pay for the services he needs to succeed in school.

916,Austims question,"
        Autism is characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication. Examples of social deficits include lack of initiations in social play and lack of interest or awareness of others. Examples of communication deficits include delays in spoken language, lack of initiation in conversations with others, and stereotyped or repetitive vocalizations. In addition, individuals with an autism spectrum disorder often have stereotyped motor actions, have a restricted range of interests, and show a resistance to change in routine. These delays are usually observed prior to age 3. In addition, Autism is usually associated with a delay in cognitive skills and a diagnosis of mental retardation, which may range from mild to profound.

Asperger’s Disorder is similar to Autism in that there are severe deficits in social interaction, the presence of stereotyped and repetitive behavior. In addition, these features must cause impairment in social functioning. However, unlike individuals diagnosed with autism, those diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder do not have significant delays in language acquisition or cognitive development. Features present with Asperger’s are typically not detected before 3 years of age. A diagnosis of Asperger’s Disorder is not given if criteria are met for another Pervasive Developmental Disorder.

917,Compromised immune system,"
        It is well established that autism spectrum disorders have a genetic origin and that this genetic inheritance results in abnormal brain growth regulation.  There is much less information about potential immune system involvement in autism.  There have been many reports of persons with autism having verified immune system ""problems.""  This has led many people to suggest that there is immune system dysregulation involved.  Most of this speculation occurs in fringe journals with relatively few large scale studies conducted by researchers clearly qualified to conduct such research.  There is certainly a need for more study.

One recent study by Rosen and colleagues (2007; Pediatrics) examined whether more infections occurred in the first two years of life for children with ASDs relative to typically developing peers.  Interestingly, there were no differences between the populations though children with ASDs actually had slightly fewer ear infections than their typically developing peers though children w/ASDs were more likely to have an infection in the first month of life and more likely to have a genito-urinary infection.  These data have some clear limitations as the authors suggest, they are not definitive but suggest the need for further study of autism and the immune system.  Early higher rate of infection, such as at one month, is interesting when taken together with the known increased rates of autism detected in mothers who contract certain diseases while pregnant (like rubella).  These early environmental exposures are contrary to what many who would prefer to blame vaccines for autism suggest may be related to the cause of autism.  If more time and research money were placed in such potentially useful research into pre-natal or very early peri-natal exposure to environmental conditions, then this would be a welcome change.

This, of course, does not directly address your question.  If you feel your child has problems with their immune system, discuss this with your pediatrician to determine whether it would be wise to consult with an immunologist.  Though allergies are common in all populations, when a child has one or more, it is also a good idea to have allergies more precisely examined.  One excellent source of information on allergies is the MedlinePlus:Allergy.  I'm pasting in the address to this website.

        This is just an idea.  But you could try seeing a nutricianist so that they can firstly look at what she is eating and drinking to make sure it is balanced.  They would then be able to advise you on some vitamins and minerals that might aid her immune systems and also help to keep detoxing.  Nothing drastic, just good common sense stuff ie. remove all caffine and stimulants and sugar from the diet, lots of water, herbal teas with nettle extract (I find blackberry and nettle good), vitamin B complex and vitamin C complex etc.  But take advice, because she is only 7 and you don't want to overdose her on any vitamins as too many can be as bad as too little.  Goats milk soap is very good for the skin, I have heard that epsom salts baths can also be good.
Organic food if you can afford it - or grow your own.  Exercise is also good.
Do you think she might have an allergy to any pets?  If you suspect dust mites you can replace carpets with wooden floors and only keep a few stuffed toys which you wash at above 60 degrees or which you freeze overnight to kill mites.  
You can also buy air filters that can take allergens out of the air in the house.  
Make sure all washing materials in the house are all organic, or make your own - it is easy to do and more effective than the stuff you buy.

920,Autism Concern,"
        I would definitely recommend that you have your son's speech evaluated and seek early intervention services to target his language delay. Your pediatrician should be able to assist with identifying some local resources for developmental screening. Aside from your language concerns, the other issues that you describe sound fairly typical for a toddler, but you should describe all of your concerns during an in-person evaluation.

921,Autism Concern,"
        Follow the above advise.  A Speech Therapist is responsible for speech and language development as well as social interaction and play skills.  You would be wanting one that has experience of speech delays associated with hearing loss, as well as developmental issues.
If you also google to find similar characteristics between those on the autistic spectrum and those with hearing difficulties you will see that there are some similar difficulties.  But those with only hearing loss do go on to learn the skills that those on the spectrum always have difficulty with (however children on the spectrum can be affected in this, or any area, severely or mildly).  This is just my own opinion, but the reason I think that the two types of children develop similar speech and social characteristics is because many on the autistic spectrum have language processing difficulties to such an extent that they are getting about the same amount of auditory information as a child with hearing difficulties.  So although they aren't deaf and can 'hear' they can't actually process alot of what is said at the time it is being said, which maybe similar to how some children with hearing difficulties pick up certain aspects of a word or a sentence, but maybe not enough of it to get the full picture.
So get him into a programme with an experienced SALT as above and ask them to also teach you how to communicate with him and also how to interact socially.
Your post is showing that he is showing an interest in other people eg. asking where mummy is, and he is also wanting to interact eg. asking if you want to go outside with him.  Children on the spectrum tend to come across as very self sufficient and don't tend to seek interaction and play to the extent that their peers do.  Many can be quite content in their own company for most of the day or they can go to the other extreme and always want someone with them, but only to follow their instructions or meet the child's needs eg. I want a drink, I'm hungry, turn on the TV, and not interacting and chatting with them as other children do.
But I would also mention to the SALT about characteristics similar in children with autism and hearing difficulties so that she can explain that to you.
If you persist in having these concerns then you can ask for your child to have a full assessment by a team of professionals that are experienced in diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders in children who also have hearing difficulties.

922,My 4 yr old and A.S.,"
        As you may know, Autism is characterized by deficits in language and social development as well as the presence of restricted and repetitive behavior. A diagnosis of Asperger's Disorder is assigned based on deficts in social development and the presence of repetitive behavior, with no language or cognitive delays. Your description does sound more consistent with the criteria for Asperger's, but it is not possible to assess the severity of symptoms without a thorough, in-person assessment. So, I do recommend that you pursue an evaluation. Whether or not a diagnosis is assigned, though, it is important for you to consider your son's strengths and weaknesses (as you are currently) and to make decisions about his care and education based on those strenghts and weaknesses. So, even if you son is not diagnoses with Asperger's it would be important for you to work with his school to address his social difficulties. Likewise, he will need to learn to tolerate things being out of place and disruptions to his routine.

923,My 4 yr old and A.S.,"
        I am a mum of an 8 year old boy with high functioning autism.  You can google DSM IV Aspergers and read the diagnostic criteria for that.  
As  you say, many of the behaviours and traits can be seen as strengths.  However in our social world I think you can see that his language and social interaction difficulties are going to cause him some problems as well as he need to keep to routines.  His need for rules and inflexibility is going to cause him stress and anxiety.  He also sounds like he may have some sensory issues.  
My son also appears very independent.  Unfortunately it is not that they are 'independent', it is because they don't get social interaction, otherwise they would ask for things or help to get things rather than attempt to do stuff themselves.  
Infact tonight, I was upstairs doing homework with my daughter, when my son came into the bedroom to apologise to me.  I asked him ""what are you saying sorry for"", and he said ""for losing the dog, but don't worry I found him now"".  I always keep our house doors/windows locked, so I asked him ""what have you done""?  And he told me that he had wanted to go next door to say hello to the neighbours.  But because the front door and side gate was locked, he went down the garden, climbed over the wall into their garden and went and knocked on their door.  When he went into the garden the dog got out through the hedge and was on the road.  He called it to come back in and it did, and he returned back over the wall and into the house.  And I missed all that in 20 min!!!  Now, on the one hand, he was trying to be social.  But everything was inappropriate.  He is 8 and he should not leave the house without telling me.  He shouldn't climb over walls into other people's property.  He let the dog escape.  He didn't come to get help he tried to solve it himself.  Then he thought about what he had done, decided he had made a bad call and came to apologise.  
Your son will have some similar issues.  He may tend to talk at people rather than hold a two way conversation.  At the moment he is 4 and children can be quite forgiving at that age (they can also be nasty too), but I would advise you to find the right educational environment for him, which ideally would be in a school that has other pupils with Aspergers and has experience and expertise in teaching them academically and socially as well as teaching them life skills.  That maybe in a mainstream school, or it maybe in a mixtured environment.  
I don't think his difficulties are down to being an only child.

        I can completely identify with the feeling of ""am I being an worried parent or is there really something more going on"". My son is around the same age as yours, just turned 5 in December and is going to be tested through the school system for Aspergers by a Neuropsychologist. I was going to get him individualized testing but he is already in a a special education class (Pre-K) at an elementary school, so they suggested while they were doing his annual testing they would include this since his problems are more along the Social/Behavior level and not learning. My son has alot of the same traits as yours, very imaginitive and intense while building with Legos etc. Also he is usually VERY happy but is very sensitive and can lose control and become sad at a moments notice. 

The main thing is to find the right type of school environment where the staff is educated and has experience with these types of children, which can be hard because it's almost as if they fall in between..they don't really have serious problems,  but they do need some type of special care because of their different needs . It takes a big weight off when you know they are somewhere they will flourish.

        You are correct that early diagnosis and intervention are the primary focus, and services are much more limited for older individuals. There is no research to support ear treatments for autism spectrum disorders. There are many ""interventions"" that are marketed to those desperate to find help. Many of these are ineffective yet costly and sometimes dangerous. So, I would recommend being very skeptical about treatment claims. A diagnosis would be assigned only if there is clinically significant impairment in important areas (e.g., social, occupational). It is not clear from your description if this is the case. If your brother in-law has not seen a psyciatrist lately, I recommend that you encourage him to do so.

        Although medication can be helpful, medication alone will not solve behavior problems. I would be very cautious about adding or adjusting medications to solve each new problem that arises.

Teenage years for me and many other Aspergers people are very difficult.  Acceptance by our peers, understanding of gender issues, relationships and rejection are overwhelming.  I was always fighting bullies, saying the wrong thing, getting over stimulated around other children and going down in my grades.

Have you considered social skill development, coping strategies, awareness/understanding of his Aspergers with a psychologist that specialises in Aspergers.  Sex education is understated as an issue for aspergers teenagers and there some books on the market to assist parents.  Try googling for these books.

In some instances medication is essential for well-being, I personally found medical Doctors preescribe what they do not understand.  Actually that is their amin function, to medicate.  Try counselling for your son first.

BTW stimulant meds like Adderall  can cause increased anxiety, irrritability/aggression and sleep problems.  Seek out a Clinical psychologist who specialises in Aspergers, my experience with meds is negative and many other aspergers people state the same.  Our disorder is neurological, not mental health.  We can develop mental health disorder from continuous social rejection and trying to understand this world.

        I agree with above posting.
What kind of school is your son at?
Is it a mainstream only school that has no experience of children on the autistic spectrum.
All the things you mention are common to his diagnosis.  In school they should be presenting his work in such a way that he can cope with it.
If he has problems following whole class instructions he may need to be taught in smaller groups.
If he has auditory processing or auditory memory problems he may need to be presented on typed worksheets.
If he is attention and focus issues his environment needs to be assessed to see if it is too over stimulating.  He may benefit from a workstation.
He may need a TA to check that he understands what he should be doing.
He may need extra frequent breaks during classes.
He may need an identified place that he can go to when he is feeling overwhelmed.
He may need a 'choose time' built into his daily timetable to motivate him.
He will probably need some kind of adult support and structures during breaktimes and dinnertimes because these children have difficulties with social interaction as part of their diagnosis.
Due to his age he is probably going through puberty.  So he will have all those extra hormones floating around.
Talk to him, when he is calm.  Ask him what upsets him at school.
If your son is taking medication so that he is easier to handle in a mainstream school, then maybe that isn't the right school for him.  If he is becoming depressed because he is self aware and can see he has difficulties with other people but he is not receiving any help or interventions to help improve those skills, then again that may not be the right school for him.
You need a school that has experience and expertise in teaching children with aspergers.  Depending on his abilities that maybe an school that only has children with high functioning autism or aspergers, or it maybe a school that is a mixture of mainstream children and those on the spectrum which also has the extra teacher to pupil ratio and experience and expertise in aspergers.  
Has your son been assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist and an Educational Psychologist who have experience of children with aspergers?  Have they clearly identified and itemised his areas of difficulty, and have they made recommendations to his school about how he should be supported in those areas, including therapies, programmes of support and provision etc?

The stress made physically ill, increased face blindness, short term memory was terrible, fixed gaze at people and would talk excessively.  Clinical psychologist new it was the enviroment and suggested some coping strategies.  A smaller gym was of benefit.

931,My grandson's behavior,"
        Autism is characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication. Examples of social deficits include lack of initiations in social play and lack of interest or awareness of others. Examples of communication deficits include delays in spoken language, lack of initiation in conversations with others, and stereotyped or repetitive vocalizations. In addition, individuals with an autism spectrum disorder often have stereotyped motor actions, have a restricted range of interests, and show a resistance to change in routine. These delays are usually observed prior to age 3. In addition, Autism is usually associated with a delay in cognitive skills and a diagnosis of mental retardation, which may range from mild to profound. 

The lack of social interaction in your grandson is consistent with a diagnosis of autism. You are in a difficult situation if your son and daughter-in-law do not recognize deficits that you have observed in your grandson. I suggest that you recommend to your son and daughter-in-law that they seek the assistance of a qualified professional who specializes in the diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorders so that they may recieve an accurate diagnosis for their son. Although diagnosis alone will not point to an appropriate intervention, it will lead them to identify appropriate services for him. I also recommend that you suggest that your son and daughter-in-law seek the support of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, who would be able to conduct the appropriate assessments and to assist in developing a curriculum for increasing appropriate social interaction and play behavior. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers.

932,My grandson's behavior,"
        I am not a professional, I am a mother of an 8 year old boy with high functioning autism.  Finding the right educational setting is crucial for both their education and self esteem.  What I did, which you could consider, is I had a private report done by a Speech and Language Therapist who had experience of autistic spectrum disorders and speech disorders.  You need to find an independent professional not tied to the health or education service (because if they are independent they are more inclined to tell you what the child needs, as opposed to what the system provides).  They assessed his receptive and expressive speech, working memory, auditory memory, assessed him for auditory processing disorder and semantic pragmatic speech disorder.  She assessed his comprehension skills and information gaining skills using inference etc.  And she also assessed his social interaction skills.  That will give you a good idea of his areas of strength and weakness.  
Then we had a private Educational Psychologists report (independent as above), and they assessed his emotional understanding and response, his cognitive abilities (again using non-verbal assessments as he is autistic).  This gave us a very clear idea of his IQ.  You say your grandson's IQ is 90, but was that using non-verbal assessments, because if he has difficulties with language or language processing or meaning that will automatically bring his scores down and is not a true reflection of his intellectual level.  The EP was also experienced with autistic spectrum disorders and made a number of recommendations about teaching approaches etc.
These two reports should help give you a better idea of what type of schooling would best suit him.  The EP can actually be asked to visit the school to assess if she thinks the environment (ie. classroom structure/size, teaching strategies, experience etc) is going to be appropriate.
Although holding him back a year might make him fit in more at the beginning.  If he has social interaction difficulties they will remain unless they are addressed and he is taught (by teachers experienced with those on the spectrum) and supported during playtimes/dinnertimes.

        Thanks for all that information. It would all be a good thing to give him all that assesment. But I have one problem. My son and daughter-in-law are in denial of him having autism. I see that it is very mild but he does have symptoms: plays by himself, just scribbles in a coloring book while his cousin same age colors in the lines, slow to answer my questions, gives one word answers. He interacts with his younger brother who is extremely smart and friendly. His IQ test was given by a regular yeshiva school psychologist and it probably was the usual assessment, verbal. I don't think he has sensory issues. By that do you mean hearing difficulties? I will relay this to my older daughter who is close to my daughter-in-law and would know how to relate this stuff to her in a sensitive way. My son and daughter in law don't discuss this with me. I have a physical birth defect on my foot and leg, growth imbalance, and maybe they think I am sensitive about Bobby's autism. Thanks for your help.

        Sensory issues can affect any or all of the senses of hearing, touch, vision, taste, smell, balance and co-ordination.  And it varies day to day or even throughout the day because it is a perceptual problem.  The senses can be over or under sensitive and as I said, it can fluctuate between the two.  It is called Sensory Integration Disorder and an Occupational Therapist is the professional who would address this.  An example of behaviours (and a child may have one or many behaviours) is appearing deaf or not responding to name when there is no hearing loss, covering ears at sudden sounds, making alot of noise, difficulty finding things in complicated visual backgrounds, looking at patterns on floor, attracted to bright/shiny things, avoidance of sunlight ie. pulling up hood, picky eater, complaining of smells or tastes, over reaction to light touch, needing tags cut out of clothes, upset with hair washing/brushing, nailing cutting etc, appears not to feel pain when hurts themselves, poor balance, clumsy, doesn't like to climb like peers, screams if feet taken off the floor, poor co-ordination, problems throwing/catching a ball.
As you say it is difficult if parents are not recognising the cause behind the difficulties.  But in reality, if he is placed in a school environment where he cannot cope he will begin to show frustration and behavioural problems and it will become obvious to the parents and school that that is not the right place for him because he simply won't show much progress either academically or socially.

        The Doctor does give the stereotypical straits for autism etc, however we are quite different in many behaviours and personality.  Classical autism is quite different from Aspergers syndrome and you have suggested mild autism.  If your grandson's IQ test may not represent his true intellect if he is overly verbal and visual.  This can impact negatively on the by 10-20 marks.  A neuropsych assessment would be a better indicator of your grandson's weaknesses and strengths, he may have learning difficulties that no one is aware of as yet.I'm assuming the Doctor is psychology based.  Her recommendations are sound in relation to assessment and behavioural therapy/govt assistance.  From experience and speaking to others with Aspergers venture clear of psychiatrists, medication is their main arsenal and have little knowledge of pervasive development disorders.  Sally's insight into her son's differences is helpful and you won't see them in the DMS-IV criteria for autism spectrum disorders.  Your grandson's willingness to please and be accepted by his peers is common in some folke with ASD and we look for constant reassurance of ourselves.  Some of us are reclusive and shy from social contact.

        This sounds like a very serious problem and I certainly send my best wishes for a speedy resolution to it.  That said, renal specialists are typically not overly familiar with autism and autism specialists are not typically familiar with kidney problems, though an MD that specializes in developmental disorders should bring together knowledge in both areas.  The best pediatric hospital program that deals with helping children tolerate medical procedures is the Kennedy Krieger Institute at Johns Hopkins Medical School.  In my opinion, Dr. Keith Slifer is the foremost expert in this area.

        It is never too late to toilet train and there have been many approaches that have been shown to lead to success.  I've worked with developmentally delayed persons over 20 years old who have learned to use the toilet independently.  Looking for a Board Certified Behavior Analyst through the BACB certificant registry (www.bacb.com) may help you identify a behavior analyst who can help guide you through the process.  One of the most cited approaches to successful toilet training is Azrin and Foxx's ""Toilet Training in Less Than One Day.""  This is a book that provides detailed information about how to implement toilet training and it is available for purchase at multiple online sites.  I bought a copy for my cousin at Barnes and Noble just last year, so it might be available at your local bookstore.

        I would get a professional involved who is a going to put together an approach that all the family sticks to.  The most important thing is routine and consistency, so everyone has to be on board 100% of the time.  The consistency needs to be down to everything as very small changes to the environment, routine, words spoken as prompts etc can render it a whole new experience for him and he won't recognise it as the same thing.  An example of this is that about a year ago I went to have lunch with my son in a cafe.  He wanted fish fingers, but the waitress said ""they're not called fish fingers anymore they are called fish nuggets"".  That really upset him because he didn't know what ""fish nuggets"" were, eventhough he knows what chicken nuggets are, he couldn't use that information to guess what a fish nugget might be like.  He got very upset and was lying down on the floor screaming, whilst I was waiting at the checkout!!  And my son is high functioning autistic who goes to a mainstream school and was potty trained when he was 3.  So, if that small difference in language upset him so much, you can imagine how other changes you three adults make could upset him so much that he doesn't understand what he is expected to be doing.  Does that make sense?
I think the professional you need is a behavioural analyst and one who has experience of autism.  But all three of you need to sit down and agree on how you are going to do this.  It might be that only one person initially works on the programme and once he has learnt it it is then generalised out to the other adults.  That might make it easier and quicker for him to initially learn rather than having three different adults.  But obviously that is going to mean alot of work for that one person.  I would discuss your options with the BA.

        To answer your second question first: I would suggest that you go  identify a hospital in an urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children with autism spectrum disorders. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations. You can then take these recommendations to your local early intervention program or public school. 

In answer to your second question: The most effective treatment for children with autism regardless of level of functioning is early intensive behavioral intervention. This means that your son should receive 20 hours of direct teaching in language, social skills and self-help skills. This can include a portion of integration time with a specialized teacher who can make sure your child takes advantage of all the learning opportunities in that setting, such a social initiations, play, conversations and participation with peers. Services can be provided by early intervention or the public schools in your area.

948,Pre School Related Question,"
        I am not an expert, I am a mum of an 8 year old boy on the autistic spectrum.
A multi disciplinary team assessment carried out by health professionals is usually the best way of getting a diagnosis because it is more indepth than through education for example.  There are lots of different characteristics of autism and a child only has to have enough of them to get a diagnosis.  No two children are the same.  My son also doesn't flap or spin (although he did spin sometimes as a toddler - but even then not so much that I thought it was an issue).
Your son is just at that age when he should be beginning to develop his social side.  If he is on the spectrum he will start to have difficulties with social interaction which may look like he is simply delayed because his peers will be developing these skills and he won't be, or he won't have the same level of skills.
Once you have a diagnosis you start to think about what educational setting will be appropriate.  In my experience I resulted to getting private reports done because I couldn't get anyone to test my son so that I knew what his strengths and weaknesses were.  I was repeatedly told that ""children on the spectrum typically have difficulties with x y and z"".  But, for example, if a child has difficulties with social interaction is that because of (a) language difficulties  (ai) problems with receptive language; (aii) problems with auditory processing; (aiii) problems with comprehension or inference, (b) sensory or environmental difficulties, (c) executive function difficulties etc.  And depending on what is the 'root' problem the approach, strategy or therapy will be different.  Does that make sense??
So typically a private report by a Speech and Language Therapist and Educational Psychologist should give you a very clear idea of what his difficulties are.  The Ed Psych should also be able to tell you what kind of educational environment is going to best suit him as they assess for cognitive ability.  If you do go for private reports make sure that they are independent professionals ie. not employed by the health or educational service and that they have experience of being expert witnesses at educational tribunals.  The reason for this is that they will be impartial and will give a true reflection of his needs.  Someone employed by the health or education system will assess knowing what their department is able to provide - and that will be at a much lower level.  
In the UK if you have evidence of need (through professionals reports), the school has to provide that support regardless of whether they have the staffing level to do so.  If they don't the educational authority has to provide additional funding to meet that level of support.  That is why independent professionals are needed.
At the state you are at, I would have thought a paediatrician who specialises in childhood development and who has experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  Or if they don't have that experience that they can refer you to a multi disciplinary team that does have.
Once you have the diagnosis, you need to find out how your educational system works and what you will need to access certain schools.  Everyone country is different, and I don't know where you are.  If you feel you are hitting your head against a brick wall and getting no answers you can always find a legal advocate who specialises in special educational needs law and get some advice from them.  If you are in the UK you can contact the National Autistic Society as they have alot of helplines and educational advisors as well as a educational tribunal service.

949,Pre School Related Question,"
        If you do along the private report route this does cost money.  Therefore it is wise to do it at the most beneficial stage.  That is why seeing how the educational system work.  For example you may get access to a nursery you are happy with without a diagnosis.  Or you may need a diagnosis to get access to the nursery that can meet your child's needs.  The same will apply for primary school.  Find out what schools have experience and expertise in teaching children with autistic spectrum disorders.  An Ed Psych should be able to tell you whether your child needs to be mainstream or whether an autism only environment is better suited.  And remember that there are high functioning autism only schools (not many but they are out there).  
Usually the biggest problems start at secondary school, because even if your child has been mainstream up until then, at secondary level 11+ inclusion doens't ususally work because the other children aren't interested in special needs kids, and your child cannot interact with them socially and being in that environment is very stressful for them.  Also at this age they need alot more input on things like life skills etc that a mainstream school just won't provide.
You are right at the beginning as he isn't 3 yet, and you don't know how he is going to develop, but you do need to know what his areas of difficulty are and what are the optimum levels of therapy and by whom at this stage.  
But I just wanted to add that spending the money at the right time is the most wise.
Wherever you are, it is also worth finding out if you are entitled to any benefits post diagnosis as it all helps you to achieve your goals as the money can be used for advice or therapy.

        A further thing I noticed from your post is that he doens't always respond to his name ie. appears deaf.  He isn't noise sensitive.  He might be auditory hypo sensitive (ie. under sensitive to auditory noise).  It might be worth googling Sensory Integration Disorder.  Also google Olga Bogdashina and read an article by her printed in Autism Today.  If that sounds relelvant you can find her book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  There is a caregivers questionnaire at the back of this book that can give you a sensory profile of your child.  Our Autism Outreach Department uses this questionnaire so I know it is reputable.  
Sensory Integration Disorder means that there is differences in sensory perception which can be over or under sensitive and can fluctuate between the two.  So you will get a different response to the same sensory stimuli.  It can affect any or all of the senses or the ability to co-ordinate the senses or multi talk from a sensory point of view.  So it is very typical for a child to be engrossed 'doing' something and to appear deaf or unaware of its environment or others close by or even calling their name.  The senses are vision, sound, touch, smell, taste, balance and co-ordination.  There can be any combination of difficulties eg. a child might appear deaf on occasions, be sensitive to smell and tastes of food, brilliant balance and co-ordination - or they could be the complete opposte, or a different combination.

        Yes, the hearing tests have to be done to make sure there is no hearing loss.  But my son is the same.  I can call his name many times and he just ignores it if his attention is elsewhere.  On other occasions he responds to his name straight away.  It is a sensory and focus/attention issue.  Those on the spectrum tend to be able to do one thing at a time.  So we can watch TV whilst being aware of other people in the same room, and evesdrop on a conversation someone is having and also be aware that mum is in the kitchen making dinner etc.  Someone with autism, when watching TV is ONLY watching TV and can be totally unaware of anyone or anything else in the environment.  Their attention is 100% on the TV.  And whenever their attention is on something, either TV, or a puzzle or lego etc and you interrupt their concentration, they can become very upset.
My son is now 8, and he was eventually diagnosed when he was 6, although I had been raising my concerns about certain things since he was 3.  And along the way I have learnt alot about my son, and have made professionals assess and explain to me why he has difficulties with certain things, and when they have refused I have had private assessments.  This has shown me that my son has an autistic spectrum disorder, he also has disordered speech and Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder.  He has Sensory Integration Disorder, Irlen Syndrome and Auditory Processing Disorder.  He also has auditory processing delays and difficulties with auditory memory.  Knowing all those disorders etc makes me very clear about what his needs are and who should be going into his school (eg. Speech Therapist, Occupational Therapist, Educational Psychologist etc) and how much time they should be dedicating to him.  It has meant I have the evidence of his needs, and have been able to go to an Educational Tribunal and win every single thing I had proved he needed.  This is way over and above what would normally be provided in a state school, and is way above what those in the autism unit receive.  My son is mainstream and the school has experience and expertise in autism.  I was refused a place for my son at that school, but through finding out about the educational system and my sons legal rights, I managed to get him in anyway.  
As you are in the USA, it will be much easier to navigate your way through the education system than some other countries, and get the help you need either through the health system or getting your own reports done.  Never take no for an answer.  Always check any information you are given (especially if it is denying your child access to something).  You are the advocate for your child and you are the only person who will make sure that they get the provision they need.  Have the attitude of the long distance runner and just take everything a step at a time and work through it, because it will be a lifelong thing - as any child is always a lifelong project to their parents - but children need us to be more focused about what they are being provided with because we are aiming for them to be independent as adults.  If we don't have that goal in mind it won't happen.
As he is just coming up to three, you really don't know how he will progress, and these children do not come with a manual.  Typical children are measured on typical percentiles and they stay on those percentiles.  Our children don't.  They can be at the same stage for a long time, then suddenly come on and make incredible progress.  
So at this stage, I think you need to work towards a diagnosis, and find out what different kinds of nursery there are in your area and what the entry criteria is.  
Most parents start by wanting and hoping that their child can remain mainstream - and some, with high functioning aspergers do.  Those on the autistic spectrum (which by definition means they have the language difficulties as well) tend to struggle much more in a mainstream school.  Then parents try to move their child to a school that will have the supports their child needs only to find that there are no places left.  Then you end up fighting to get a school place that you initially hoped you would never need.  And the diagnosis you dreaded getting is suddenly the ticket to the therapies your child needs and then you worry about ever having that diagnosis removed and therefore the supports and therapies removed.  It is a strange merry-go-round.  
That is why I advise you to find out about the education system in you county, and the legal rights your child has through educational law.  If you are refused access to certain nurseries or schools you think your child needs, don't take no for an answer.  By law the state has to provide the educational needs of a child.

        It is unlikely that medication alone will resolve the behavioral issues that you have described. In addition, all medications have some risk of serious side effects. So, it is important to seriously consider alternatives to medication. I strongly recommend that you seek the assistance of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst who would be able to work with you and the school to be sure that your son has the support he needs to succeed. A large body of research suggest that behavioral interventions are highly successful with the type of behavior difficulties that you described. Even if your son eventually requires medication, medication should be used in the context of appropriate educational and behavioral interventions. In addition, it will be important for you and your son's school to track his behavior in such a way that you would be able to evaluate whether medicaiton is effective. A registry of Certified Behavior Analysts is available at the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (bacb.com).

        I think the key is the fact that this is a new school for your son.  Those on the spectrum have great difficulties with change in general and changes to routine.  A new school means that everything has changed.  All the teachers/pupils are different, taught in different classrooms, with a different timetable and different curriculum subjects, with different food at dinnertime, with different supports or strategies (or none at all) being used.  Infact you couldn't change his situation any more if you tried!
I presume he is in a special school?  
It maybe that he will need visual supports and a very high amount of structure and explicit teaching to help him adjust to this change in routine.  Once it is at a level where he is coping, with time, they can gradually reduce the level of support - but for now it may mean supporting him at a level that he required when he was much younger.  By that I don't mean they do everything for him.  I mean that everything is highly structured and visually presented and broken down into small manageable chunks, and that he has one key nominated worker so that the person helping him is not changing all the time.  If he is finding the new school environment difficult to cope with the school needs to look at it to make sure it is low arousal.  He might benefit from a booket with a picture of each classroom and the teacher/teaching assistants in that class.  He may need alot of extra input from the Speech Therapist to help him learn the names of his teacher and some of the pupils.  He may need alot of extra support during playtimes and dinnertimes.
From his point of view, it must be like he has just been dropped onto an alien planet.  Everything he knew at his previous school no longer applies.  He is starting from ground zero again because he doesn't have the language or social skills that we have that help us adapt to a new environment such as a change in school or workplace.
And follow the advice of the expert as above.

        You know your son better than anyone.  You are his advocate.  If you have a strong feeling about how they should approach this escalation in behaviours, put it in writing to the school.  If they don't do that you have evidence that they have'nt listened to your advice.  If you feel that they are not providing the level of support your son needs and you are hitting your head against a brick wall, you can find a legal advocate who has experience of special educatioinal needs law and it might be worthwile to pay for a couple of hours of advice to see how you can move this situation forward.

        Autism is characterized by delays in language and social development as well as the presence of repetitive behavior (e.g., repetitive motor movements, rituals). Therefore, your description of your daughter does not sound consistent with a diagnosis of autism. It is great that you have received an early intervention screening. As you know, It is vitally important to intervene early with all developmental delays. Continue to share your concerns about her development with your pediatrician and her early intervention team and to advocate for appropriate services.

958,Can someone explain,"
        Although children on the autism spectrum sometimes do not develop eye contact as typically developing children do, it is important to recognize that eye contact and other absent social behaviors can be taught and encouraged. Social skills training allows children with autism spectrum disorders to become more fully integrated with their typical peers and to benefit more fully from these opportunities.

959,Can someone explain,"
        There seems to be a couple of explanations.
The first one is that it is uncomfortable, even painful for them.  We don't understand that, but we just have to accept that that is how it makes them feel.
The second is that they have difficulties multi-tasking from a sensory point of view.  So, if they look at you they become focused on 'looking' and therefore don't hearing what is said to them or what is going on in the wider environment.  So they avoid making eye contact so that they actually get an understanding of what is being said.  A child like this in the classroom may get easily distracted by visual stimuli or other sensory stimuli and therefore 'miss' what is actually being taught because they cannot look, listen, write, think etc at the same time.
The third reason is down to attention and focus.  This is explained rather like wiring.  Our brains are wired up differently to theirs and we can therefore pay attention to a number of things at the same time eg. talk whilst listening and looking and being aware of what is in the wider environment.  Someone with this type of diffculty will only be able to put their attention into one thing at a time.  Therefore they may be able to talk at someone, but not be able to talk, wait and listen to the response of the other person.  If you think of social interaction rather like a tennis match with it passing between the two players like the tennis ball being hit back and forth.  Someone with attention and focus (and sensory) difficulties can either keep hitting the ball, or keep receiving the ball, but cannot do both at the same time.  Therefore information is either coming in or going out.  So in a social interaction they might talk at someone, or listen to what is being said but be unable to gather their thoughts and give a response at that time.  Avoiding eye contact helps them keep their focus as it is one less thing to be trying to do.
I have heard many times of children coming out of school having been given a message to give to their parents.  However, if they have been made to 'look at the teacher' whilst they were given the message there is a very good chance that the child will not have heard anything.
Infact most successful interaction with children or adults who have great difficulty with this is to avoid eye contact, and don't even expect them to be facing you.  When you are in the same room say their name until they acknowledge they are listening, and then 'talk to the wall'.  By talking, and not demanding their attention in the way we expect (ie. looking at us and facing us), they appear to be able to take in what is said because that is what they are concentrating on.
A woman called Olga Bogdashina has written several good books called ""Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers"", ""View From the Bridge"", (I can't remember all their names).  She gives a very good insight into how those on the spectrum 'perceive' information.  It is different to ours, and how we receive sensory information affects our perception, affects our world picture.  
Does that make any sense at all?
Google Sensory Integration Disorder as well as Auditory Processing Disorder - these conditions frequently accompany a spectrum disorder, and by reading about them you might get a better idea of the kinds of difficulties they experience.
And it also has to be remembered that these children do develop, and difficulties they have at 2 might be totally different at age 5.  My son had alot of sensory issues as a toddler.  Now he is 8 and has learnt alot of coping strategies himself.  Sensory Issues are not a major barrier for him now.  Now he is becoming more social and social interaction difficulties are causing him more problems along with his speech difficulties (he is diagnosed with Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder).  And, if his speech develops significantly, as an adult it might become harder to 'identify' that he is on the spectrum.

        Not everyone on the spectrum even has this problem.  Alot of adults have managed the 'appearing to look at you' but they are looking just over your shoulder or some other part of the face.  
There is also the aspect that you mentioned, that they aren't interested because it doesn't mean anything to them.  There are many, if not all, those on the spectrum have difficulties with social interactions, including 'chatting' and the 'two way' system of giving and receiving information.  Those on the spectrum tend to talk at you and appear not to be interested in getting your opinion or any response from you about what they are talking about.  Or they may ask you for information, but again there isn't this two way 'chat'.  If they are verbal, speech is usually around getting their needs met ie. what they want to eat, drink, do, watch on TV/computer and tell you about something that interests them.  My son never tells me about his day at school, or ask me what i've been doing, or what i'm thinking/feeling etc.  If I give him that information eg. today I did xxxx and xxxx happened - he understands that perfectly.  But he just doesn't seem to know how to engage in this type of conversation.  If I am talking he can frequently tell me 'that's enough you can stop now'.  So he obviously doesn't even like hearing chatter.  But then my son has high functioning autism and not Aspergers.

963,My sons behavior,"
        The only way to find out is to ask his paediatrician to refer you to a multi disciplined team that has experience of diagnosing autism.  You say he is already having speech therapy.  Is this therapist experienced in speech disorders as well as autistic spectrum disorder?  A good therapist should be able to tell you whether his speech and play skills are giving an indication of an autistic spectrum disorder.  An experienced multi disciplinary team would include a Speech Therapist, Clinical psychologist, Educational Psychologist, and maybe an Occupational Therapist or Neurologist, depending on the child's difficulties.
You can also google the diagnostic criter ie. DSM IV Austistic Spectrum Disorder and see what it says.  A child has to have enough traits in each section to get a full diagnosis.
It is good that he is toilet trained and can dress himself, those are good self help skills that he has learnt at the right time from a developmental point of view.  However it is also common for children on the spectrum to have a 'spiky profile'.  This means they are 'typical' or even advanced at some skills and then really struggle or have virtually no ability in other skills.
I presume he has had his hearing checked.
You mention quite alot of sensory behaviour.  Google Sensory Integration Disorder to see if that sounds relevant.  I also found a book by a woman called Olga Bogdashina very useful called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  You can google her name and read an article by her printed in Autism Today.  Her book has a caregivers questionnaire that you can complete to give you a sensory profile of your son.  Occupational Therapist are the professionals who assess and provide therapy for sensory issues.  Another good test they can use is the Winn Dunn sensory assessment.
His making a beat noise all the time could be a number of reasons.  It could be a rigid repetitive behaviour under autism, or it could be a sensory behaviour he uses either to distract him from other noises that bother him or because he needs more auditory input and he makes the beat noise to do this.  The body has to receive sensory information.  Infact sensory deprivation is a form of torture.  So if one of their senses is not working well they try to produce more sensory input.  And from the other end, if the sense is hyper sensitive to noise they can appear deaf (literally turn their hearing off), or cover their ears at noise, or make noise to distract them.   And with sensory problems their senses can fluctuate between under and over sensitive throughout the day and day to day.  So you will get different response to the same sensory input.  For example my son might cover his ears, appear deaf, enjoy popping balloons and enjoy going to drum club.  So it isn't as simple as a noise volume problem.  There is also Auditory Processing Disorder which can cause problems with auditory input and habituating to sounds.
My son's Occupational Therapist has just begun a listening therapy with him called Listening With the Whole Body.  There is clinical evidence that this therapy achieves results, so I am excited to be trying it out.  
But first you need to find out what is the cause, and the only way to do that is through assessments.

        Many of the difficulties that you describe sound typical of 4 year old children. For example, difficulty transitioning from play to clean up is very common.

        My now 12 year old son was diagnosed with Asperger's approximately a year and a half ago.  I had never heard of such a thing until his teacher talked to me and shared her suspicions that he may have it.  I was very sceptical at first as well as slightly offended.  I decided to research it however.  I was astonished to see a list of signs/symptoms of Asperger's....they described my son completely.  I then took him to see a psychiatrist who confirmed the diagnosis.  He was also diagnosed with ADD.
My son is INCREDIBLY SMART and very adult-like.  He always has been.  The things that you have described sounds a great deal like my son.  I would encourage you to research Asperger's as much as possible.  There is a wealth of information online, as well as many books that are available at large bookstores.
My son has also learned a lot about Asperger's.  He's actually quite proud that he has it!  There are a lot of famous and well-respected individuals that share his same syndrome.  It actually has a lot of benefits :-)

        I would go to his paediatrician and tell them the things that concern you and ask for a multi disciplinary team assessment by professionals who have experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  
He is at that age when other children are becoming more social and he isn't.  That is why you are starting to notice the social differences eg. playing parallel, on the outside of the groups during playtime etc.  He will develop in this area, but he will need adult support to help him initiate and sustain play and he will need to be taught some very basic social skills that we take for granted - such as holding a two way conversation.
Lack of eye contact is common.  Some individuals say that making eye contact makes them very uncomfortable.  I wouldn't force eye contact, and neither would a school that had experience of autistic spectrum disorders.  It can also sometimes be down to sensory processing difficulties.  For example, my son cannot look at anyone whilst he is talking.  If he looks into their eyes he cannot gather his thoughts to speak, or if they are speaking to him he cannot remember what they said.  So there can be difficulties with 'multi-tasking' from a sensory point of view.  Your son may drift around the classroom for the same reason.  He cannot listen and look at the teacher at the same time.  He needs his speech testing by a Speech and Language Therapist.  They should assess his receptive as well as his expressive speech along with auditory memory, working memory, auditory processing etc.  The SALT is also the professional who assesses social interaction skills and they should put together a programme of supports eg. social skills club, mentoring or circle of friends, dinnertime clubs etc.
He is only 3 now, but by the time all the assessments are done and recommendations are being put into place, he will probably be nearly 4.  And without these supports, therapies and structure he will struggle which will affect his self esteem.

        Your description sounds consistent with the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria.  But, of course, diagnosis requires a thorough, in-person assessment by a qualified professional.

969,Does my 10 Year Old Son Have Aspergers Syndrom,"
        You can google DSM IV Aspergers for the diagnostic criteria the professionals are looking at to see if a child has enough of the behaviours to get a diagnosis.  I am a parent of a high functioning autistic and your son is showing difficulties and behaviours that are common in people with a diagnosis.
As he has sensory issues google Sensory Integration Disorder.  Also google the name Olga Bogdashina and read an article by her printed in Autism Today.
Your son also notices 'changes in the routine' eg. commenting on everyones dinner and a higher number that is usual.  Do changes in routine or expectations upset him?
When your son gets upset when the teacher yells at the whole class, he may not be able to understand or distinguish that the children is shouting at the children who have been naughty.  When my son was younger, if I told his older sister off he would go and sit on the naughty step!
Taking things literally is common.  Also concrete thinking where things can only be done in a certain way or in a certain sequence.  This can also lead to rigid behaviours or routines.
Anxiety and stress is common.  When confronted with situations they don't know how to cope with.  So he will need to be told and taught that it is okay not to know the answers, or not to understand what you have to do, and that in those situations you ask for help.  If he finds it hard to initiate conversation to ask for help, he should be given a card with a help symbol on it and he needs to be taught how to use it.  Eg. Get up and give the help symbol to the classroom teacher/assistant etc.  That should reduce the anxiety.  Try to imagine how you used to feel in school when you didn't know what to do.  That is how many of these children feel all day long.
Being clumsy etc is also down to poor balance or proprioception (these are also senses) - an Occupational Therapist should assess him - and also assess handwriting skills and motor planning skills.  This should also rule in/out dyspraxia.
Problems with smells/tastes/textures/sound/visual (eg. bright sunlight) - difficulties in these areas are due to sensory issues.  My son also does the same thing about having to open the window of the car.  If I try to stop him he says it stinks and it makes him feel sick.  If I don't allow him to open the window he will frequently vomit.
Having a limited range of interests/obsessions is typical.  So is talking about it regardless of whether the other person is even interested.  That is a social interaction difficulty.  He hasn't learnt the art of conversation or to recognise how to alter or stop his interactions depending on the response of the other person.  How does he respond to people when they interact with him?  Can he play with his peers?
Google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder to see if that is relevant.
Not having empathy is common.  However this is usually down to not understanding the situation and the implications of it, rather than not feeling.  You say your son crys when the younger sibling is hurt - so he does get that - unless it is a learnt rigid response.  Can he watch TV eg. something like 'Lassie Come Home' and understand why the boy is sad?  If so he maybe able to understanding things in some circumstances - but not be able to use that learnt information and apply it to another situation.  This is called problems with generalisation.

        Hi Sally. Thank you so much for your very thorough answer to me. Yes, changes in routine upset him. If anyone sits in his chair or if he doesn't have his special placemat, he freaks out...stuff like that. How does he act when people try to interact with him? It depends. He isolates himself at the bus stop. But, for example, my 2 year old daughter is on the spectrum, so when her therapists come to the house, I have had to scold him many times because he won't stop talking about Katie to them. He now isn't allowed to be in the same room while we are having therapy. He doesn't react well to kids, but he talks and talks and talks to adults. One of our neighbors had my son over to her autistic sons' therapy session and the therapist asked my neighbor if my son had Aspergers so that is when I know that my suspicions were probably correct. My son doesn't have any friends (even though there are tons of kids where we live)...but he does have one friend at school. You also asked if he would understand why Lassie come home is sad. I am not sure. I have 4 kids so sometimes it is hard to keep track of each of them (I know that sounds awful). But I will test this out during this long weekend.  Why do you think that he cries hysterically when either I, my husband, or his baby sister gets hurt?

        I'll try and come up with a couple of suggestions for the crying when a close family member is hurt.
He may notice a change in your behaviour because when we are in pain our faces look different, we may stop talking or may shout an expletive!  Anyway, it could be a change in your behaviour that upsets him (as he is very rigid with his behaviour anyway if he needs his own chair, placemat, cup etc).  So that might be down to it.
Or he may well understand that the family member is hurt and that really upsets him.  It is not true that those on the spectrum do not have emotions or empathy.  They often do - which is why I asked about the Lassie film.  If you do watch something like that try not to give him the answers, but ask questions like  ""what does that boy's face look like - is he happy or sad"".  ""What do you think has made him sad"" - and see what his answers are.  My son can show empathy in some situations with some people.  But he cannot generalise that understanding into other environments.  So he may understand that I hurt myself and he may ask if I am okay, or he may get upset.  If he sees someone fall down on the street he would be more inclined to laugh, because it is like a Tom and Jerry Cartoon.  He cannot see the other persons point of view (lack of Theory of Mind), but with close family members it is easier.
Interestingly, when I had an operation on my foot, and it was explained to both my children that I would need help etc - it was my autistic son who kept trying to help me (trying to push me up the stairs - bless him!).  So, my opinion is that they cannot generalise things they know into other situations.  And that if the situation is fully explained to them (rather than leaving them to try to work it out) - they will behave appropriately.  But without it being explicitly explained to them they do not make the connections between information and are not able to predict outcomes.
In general do you think he can understand facial expressions.  Try doing some with him at home and see if he can recognise different facial expressions and also different tones of voice.  Eg. say something nice to him in an angry voice and see if he thinks you are happy or angry etc.
You can do a home test for theory of mind.  Have two teddies and have teddy (a) in the room and teddy (b) out of the room.  The teddy in the room (a) has some chocolate and eats some of it.  Then that same teddy (a) hides it behind one of the cushions on your sofa and then leaves the room.  Then in comes teddy (b) who accidently finds the chocolate, eats some of it and then puts the chocolate behind a different cushion and then leaves the room.  Then bring back teddy (a) and ask your child where teddy will go to get his chocolate.  If he gets the answer wrong and says he would go to the cushion were teddy (b) left the choclate - this means he cannot understand that teddy (a) was not in the room and did not see where teddy (b) put the chocolate.  There are alot of speech and communication and social interaction that needs the above skill.  If he fails the 'test' also mention it when you see whoever is seeing your son.
Back to the crying ... Has there ever been an incident when someone hurt themselves and it meant a negative outcome for your child eg. you were going to go to the cinema and someone hurt themselves and you had to cancel?  
Is your son very sound sensitive?  It might be the actual crying that is upsetting him.  I know of a number of children who are absolutely distraught if a baby cries - not because they are concerned about the baby but because the noise just sends them crazy.  
If he does have sensory issues please post back.
So really, to try to get to the bottom of it you have to be a bit of a detective.  From the examples above you will see that there could be many causes and all of them tie in with an autistic trait.  The thing is with these children (and adults) is that they have what is called 'a spiky profile'.  This means there are things they are good at and things we consider much easier, they cannot do.

        You certainly have a very complex situation and I don't believe that ""googling"" is going to sufficiently answer your questions and concerns.  The internet is full of useful and, at least as much, useless and counterproductive information.  It is often difficult to determine what type of information you have googled.

It is certainly possible that your son has an autism spectrum disorder and neurofibromatosis, as they sometimes co-occur.  It is critically important to have this condition closely managed, as you are probably already aware. NF1 is the most common form and though there is no known treatment there are good indications that this genetically inherited disease can be managed to reduce the severity of its symptoms.  If your son has NF2 there have been some recent and potentially groundbreaking advances in treatment that can be found at the next link. For professionally screened information on NF start with MedlinePlus at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/neurofibromatosis.html.

If you would like more information about autism, MedlinePlus also has an autism page at  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/autism.html.  A link to an Asperger's Syndrome page can also be accessed there.  I suggest that you seek out a competent developmental evaluation of your son with the expressed purpose of determining whether he has an autism spectrum disorder.  He may be receiving early intervention services now but if he has an autism spectrum disorder, research suggests that ecelctic early intervention services (and any other approach to treating autism) is not as effective as applied behavior analysis (Howard et al., 2005).  The MedlinePlus page can suggest how to seek professional screening and who is qualified to do it.  If your son does have an autism spectrum disorder then I would recommend that you seek a Board Certified Behavior Analyst in your area to assist you in identifying effective behavioral service provision for children with autism in your area.  More information about behavior analysts and a searchable certificant registry can be found at www.bacb.com.

The specific presenting problems you talk about included delayed echolalia, direction following, and communicative difficulties, especially conversational skills.  There are numerous behavior interventions for these areas.  Delayed echolalia is likely best treated by specifically training alternative communication skills and redirecting the child to them when they emit delayed echolalia.  This is not that easy to do and must be tailored to each child's needs. The best person to do this is a BCBA with extensive experience working with children with autism.  They would likely be very familiar with the approach I mentioned. Direction following involves receptive communication and other communicative responses can be taught but a competent behavior analyst would be the best person to lead intervention.  I wish you the best of luck and hope the resources I have led you to will prove to be helpful.

        The difficulties he has with speech you should mention to his Speech and Language Therapist.  Google echolalia and delayed echolalia and perseverant speech to see if any of those is what he does.  Remember it varies, some one child might do it all the time, whilst another might do it occasionally.
He is now nearly 5 and he isn't able to hold a two way conversation, preferring to talk about his interests and I presume takes no note of whether you are interested in what you are saying or whether you contribute to the conversation.  So he almost delivers a statement and doesn't 'chat' with you?  That shows a lack of awareness of other people and problems with social interaction - because in the same way that his speech is restricted to his own interests and he cannot adapt his conversation or include other people, his play skills will most likely show similar problems.
Google Executive Function Disorder as he isn't able to follow directions well and see if that sounds relevant (that is also probably tied up with his speech - I presume his speech therapist has assessed his receptive speech skills, auditory memory and working memory skills?
Does he need to keep to routines or does he get upset is something he expected doesn't happen or changes?  Is he okay with transitions ie. being told to turn off the TV to go and down something else or does he get upset when told to stop something and insist that he finishes it?
Could the holding his breath be anything to do with transitions ie. when demands are made of him he holds his breath?  My son used to vomit if I asked him to do something that was different to what he was doing at that time.
I am not a professional, I am a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum.  And the things I have mentioned I do see in my own son.  You can google the diagnostic criteria under DSM IV autism and see what the characteristics are.  
At 5 he is going to have difficulties in school with the things he is struggling with.  Is he at nursery now, and how is that going?
I think it would be advisable to go to his paediatrician or your GP and ask for a multi disciplinary team assessment of your child by professionals who have experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  If he isn't autistic he won't get a diagnosis.  And it is called the autistic spectrum because it affects every child differently from severe to mild and each child has different 'behaviours' that fit the criteria.
Screaming and throwing tantrums when frustrated and in situations of change or anxiety etc are also common amongst children on the spectrum.

979,Pull out hair,"
        Hi Cindy,

Many individuals diagnosed with Autism (and other developmental disorders) engage in problematic and self-injurious behavior, including hair-pulling (trichotillomania).  But trichotillomania isn’t restricted to individuals with developmental delays – many typically-developing people also pull their own hair. So I’d be cautious about looking at the behavior as a feature of her Autism.

It is possible that she is pulling her hair to access some type of social reaction (attention from caregivers or avoidance of some undesired activity) but it’s also possible that it produces some sensory reaction that is itself reinforcing. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to provide a real explanation as to why she’s doing it without examining the conditions surrounding the hair pulling.  If you haven’t already, I would suggest that you talk to your pediatrician to rule out any medical conditions (perhaps she has some eye itching or discomfort?), and then contact a certified Behavior Analyst for further help on why she does it and how to best intervene.  The website below includes a directory of Behavior Analysts who may be able to help you.

        There is a name for this behaviour, it is called trichotillomania.  Google it to learn about it, and then try to relate it back to the autism to see what could be causing it.  Eg. how is school going, is she about to move school?  Does she show alot of anxiety or stress?

981,misdiagnosis,"
        Asperger’s Disorder is characterized by deficits in social interaction and repetitive behavior patterns that affect an individual’s functioning. Although symptoms such as overactivity and lack of attention are often present among individuals with an autism spectrum disorder, a diagnosis of ADHD is not made if Autistic Disorder is present. I recommend that you seek the assistance of an individual who specializes in the diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorders because an accurate diagnosis can only be made through assessment by a qualified professional. An accurate diagnosis is important for identifying appropriate services and supports for you son. I also recommend that you seek the support of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA), who would be able to conduct the appropriate assessments and to assist in developing a behavior plan to increase your son’s social skills. A BCBA can also help identify effective interventions for reducing your son’s problematic behavioral symptoms, which may reduce the amount of medication needed. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers.

982,misdiagnosis,"
        Have you looked at the diagnostic criteria for Aspergers?  You can google DSM IV Aspergers and see what the characteristics are.  It is also common for child to have bits and pieces of different disorders.  For example my son's main diagnosis is autistic spectrum disorder and he is considered high functioning because he has above average cognitive ability.  But he can also be impulsive sometimes and have problems with focus and attenton which may be down to ADD.
As those with Aspergers tend to also have Sensory Integration Disorder - google that to see if it sounds like your son.  This means any or all of his senses will be over or under senstiive.  So he may have problems with bright sunlight, noise, smells, touch, taste, balance and co-ordination.
They also tend to have difficulties with Executive Functions - google that too.
I don't know about medications.
But I do know that having the right amount of support and the right approaches/strategies at school are going to lessen any behaviours considerably.  
What is he taking the medication for?  Tantrums (known as meltdowns) are very typical of being on the spectrum - it usually happens when they are over stimulated or when there is a change or something unpredictable happens.
You are entitled to another opinion.  You can go to your GP and say that you think your son has Aspergers and ask for them to refer your son to a team of professionals that have experience in diagnosising this disorder.

        Autism is characterized by delayed language and social development as well as the presence of restricted or repetitive behavior patterns. It sounds as though you have appropriate professionals involved in addressing your child's speech issues, and it will be important to continue to track her development closely in that area. The compliance/control issues that you describe sound fairly typical for a child of her age. You seem most concerned about her seemingly unusual and repetive behavior outdoors. If this pattern of behavior is restricted to the examples you provided, I would not be particularly concerned. Typically developing children often become preoccupied with particular toys or activities and can interact with these in a repetitive way. Nevertheless, I do recommend that you share your concerns with your pediatrician, who will have a fuller picture of your child's development and the opportunity to interact with your daughter.

987,Behaviour at home and school,"
        Children are very adaptable and learn to behave in ways that fit with their environment. So, it is very common for a child to show very different behavior in different settings and with different people. Clearly there are some environmental differences between home and school that are contributing to behavioral differences. Among the many possible influential factors are (1) the number and type of demands placed on the child, (2) the amount and quality of attention, and (3) the way that adults respond to inappropriate and appropriate behavior. I suggest that you work with the school to identify these differences and try to incorporate some effective strategies from home into the school day. Given that you mentioned violent behavior, I recommend that you identify a local behavior analyst who could work with you and your son's school. The website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (bacb.com) provides a list of certified behavior analysts by state.

        Home is familiar to him and he can spend his time as he chooses.  In school demands are made on him all day long and he has to comply whether he understands or not or likes it or not.
Is he in a school that specifically has experience of teaching children on the spectrum?
The more structure and routine he has the better in school.  I presume he has things like visual timetables and his work is given orally/visually/symbolically etc.  I presume his work is broken down into smaller chunks so that he can work on one section at a time and isn't expected to do things that are beyond his ability.
I presume language is kept short and simple.
I presume he has plenty of breaks and is allowed to choose things as rewards which are built into his timetable eg. he does he literacy work for 10 mins and then is allowed to do a jigsaw puzzle of his choosing (and he knows that that is going to happen because it is shown in symbols on his daily timetable.
I presume his classroom and work area is adapted to take into account any of his sensory issues.
You say he sniffs his fingers and blinks alot.  Do you think he is oversensitive visually or in his sense of smell, or do you think he is undersensitive.  What about his other senses of touch, taste, sound, balance and co-ordination.  
If any of his senses are affected what is the impact that will have in a classroom or learning environment.  
What is causing the blinking.  Are their fluorescent lights in the classroom - these can be very distracting to children on the spectrum.  Does he avoid bright sunlight?  You could have him assessed for Irlen Syndrome.  This is a visual perceptual problem.  It can range from mild to severe.  Some people have problems with things like sunlight/florescent lights - depth perception etc - others have problems with reading because the print moves on the paper.  My son is mildly affected but wearing the glasses help him cope and reduce his sensory stimulation.
Could the blinking be a tic.
I would look to his school to see if they can make his day and lessons much more predictable for him.  I would also check that he is supported during playtimes and dinnertimes and not just left to his own devices.  They can find unstructured free time very hard to deal with.  My son goes to dinnertime clubs such as lego, art, drum club etc.  He is also supported by an aide in the playground.

989,2 year old with poor eye contact,"
        As you recognize in your description, your child's behavior does not appear consistent with a diagnosis of autism. Nonetheless, I recommend that you continue to share any developmental concerns with your child's pediatrician. You seem to have two main concerns regarding your child's behavior. First, she is shy and does not consistently make eye contact. Recongizing this early will allow you to gently encourage social development. Here are some general suggestions (some of which you are already doing). (1) Give your child plenty of opportunitites for enjoyable social interaction (e.g., play groups, going to the park, interacting with relatives). (2) Try to arrange it so that she receives more attention when she is appropriately social than when she is shy. For example, minimize attention directed toward her when she is clinging to you and hiding her face from others and be sure to give her attention when she interacts with others. (3) Encourage her to make eye contact with you by requiring it under some conditions. You will be most successful with this when she is particularly motivated. For example, when she asks for a favorite snack, you could direct her to make eye contact when making that request. 

Your other area of concern was her demands on the families routine. This behavior is fairly common for two year olds, but I think it is important to address. Often parents and their toddlers find themselves battling for control in the house. One developmental challenge for toddlers is learning which things are under their control and which are not. It is very easy for parents to give toddlers too much control because it avoids tantrums. But, ultimately, this pattern is often more disruptive to the family as toddler's demands become more pervasive or extreme. I recommend that you work with your family to decide which are appropriate choices for your toddler to make and which things are unreasonalbe. Then, try to be consistent. For example, it may be reasonable for your toddler to make a choice between 2 reasonable outfits to wear. But, she should learn that she has no control over your clothing.

990,2 year old with poor eye contact,"
        Lack of eye contact is common in autistic spectrum disorders (including aspergers).  My son's eye contact is variable.  I don't think he has a uncomfortable feeling whilst looking, I think it is down to not being able to multi-task from a sensory point of view.  So when he speaks to you he is concentrating so much on what he is trying to say that he doesn't look at you.  If I make him look at me whilst I am speaking, often he cannot tell me what I have said.
Appearing deaf, not responding to name etc is also down to sensory issues.  That also happens to me and I am not on the spectrum, but I do have sensory issues and central auditory processing disorder.  When my ears are effectively turned off, my husband has to repeat my name a number of times or even touch me to make my ears begin working again.  I have no idea why it happens.
Does she have other sensory issues eg. what is she like having her hair washed/brushed/cut - or nails cut - socks and shoes put on - do tags have to be removed from clothes - does she complain of smells or tastes/textures of food - is her balance and co-ordination okay.
Did she ever repeat what you said back to you or does she use words/phrases you say or from TV/DVDs.  Does she have an unusual tone of voice or put the emphasis on the wrong part of words.  Does she pronounce words correctly.
Doe she every answer a question with something totally unrelated to the question.  Does she understand pronouns such as I, me, you, she, him, her etc.
You say she plays okay with other children her age.  Keep an eye on that.  Can she initiate play and join in with what the other children are playing.  Does she play with them or alongside them.  Can she sustain play or does she join in for a short time and then wander off, or if the other children move somewhere else to play would she go with them or stay behind? - I know she's quite young for this, but in comparison to her peers.
Children on the spectrum also have a need for routine, to have their expectations met, some have rigid repetitive behaviours.  It is very variable.  My son rarely flaps - only if watching an exciting part of a DVD and then its over in 2 seconds.  He doesn't need routine or need things to be done in a certain way.  However he does need his timetable at school, and he resists leaving the house when at home unless I tell him what the schedule is eg. you can watch TV until this programme is finished and then we have to leave to go shopping.  He likes to wrap himself up in clothes eg. even in summer he likes his coat hood up and fully fastened.  So your daughter expecting the same thing to happen when you walk through the door, or expecting you to get dressed is a rigid way of thinking and you may see it move into other aspects of daily life.  This way of thinking can also affect learning because the child is learning 'chunks' of information rather than analysing things and putting pieces together.  Eg. with the clothes, instead of using her imagination and understanding that mum has just got up and is wearing her dressing gown, she thinks immediately that you need to be properly dressed.  That approach to learning can make it difficult for them to learn concepts.  Teaching is usually giving out bits of information for the children to put that together.  Children on the spectrum can tend to work the other way around ie. they need to see the finished product and then take it to pieces to see how it works.
And 'autism' can be very subtle and you need experienced professionals who are used to diagnosing this disorder to see your daughter.  I would recommend you go back to your paediatrician and ask to be referred to a team of professionals who have expertise in diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  Your daughter is 2 now.  It will take some months (usually) to be referred.  Usually it is the Speech and Language Therapist that assesses all aspects of receptive and expressive speech as well as auditory processing and working memory and social interaction skills.  Depending on their results they recommend other professionals see the child.  In my case that took a further 6 months waiting and on top of that 18 months of observations and assessments.  My son finally got a diagnosis of high functioning autism with sensory integration disorder (he has recently been diagnosed with Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder).  He may have dyslexia and dyscalculia.  Yet he was able to put the numbers 0-10 in order from the age of 1.  But he did that because many children on the spectrum are brilliant with visual memory and pattern construction.  So he could put them in order and tell you what each number was in the line, but couldn't identify any number out of the sequence.  He is assessed as high average intelligence.  We started to have concerns around 3+ years old because he hated nursery and wouldn't join in.  But I was fobbed off until he started school - then 6 months later they called me into school with their concerns.  With hindsight I wish I had pushed for an answer earlier because all professionals agree that the earlier you start interventions, therapies and supports the better the outcome.  And you need your daughter to have those supports (if she needs them) before she starts nursery/school otherwise it will be a very stressful and negative experience for her.
I recently moved him to a school that is a mixture of mainstream children and those on the spectrum.  All the teachers and TAs have experience and expertise in teaching children with these types of difficulties.  He has shown alot of improvement.  This morning he spelt three words correctly.  He is also starting to read rather than just memorise all the words in his reading book.  
So, some of the things you mention in your post I would recognise as being on the spectrum.  Whether or not she has enough of them in all the areas required to get a diagnosis you won't know unless she is assessed.  And she is 2.  There is alot that can be done to help her learn skills.  She sounds like she is probably high functioning.  You can google DSM IV autism to see what the diagnostic criteria is.

        Thank you so much for taking the time to reply.

She doesn't seem to have other sensory issues.  Smells, tags, textures, etc. don't bother her.  She is not a picky eater.  She is one of the most cautious human beings I have ever known, and is more apt to try a new food when she sees mommy eating it.

I did have her speech fully evaluated, and she was deemed slightly ahead.  The report did put her at the low end of normal for social interaction, but it was chalked up to shyness.

She does go to nursery school 2 days a week and enjoys it.  Her teachers think she's ""slow to warm up,"" but they tell me she loves to observe other kids intensely at times.

Yes, she sustains play well for her age.  She will let me read her books for a half hour, play independently, etc.

The biggest things are the spotty eye contact and inconsistent response to her name.

        If it is just the eye contact the inconsistent response to her name that seems to suggest an attention and focus thing ie. when she is engrossed in something she is unaware that her name is being said and she may not be able to make eye contact for the same reason.  It is a case of she is engrossed and she cannot turn her eyes to look at you, or is she not doing anything other than try to tell you something and she cannot make eye contact at the same time.
The other possibility is sensory issues, but you say she doesn't have them.  When you say she is cautious do you mean she is very careful regarding her balance and co-ordination?
If that is the only things I would just keep an eye on her.  You have had her evaluated.  If she starts to lose words, or doesn't develop her social interaction side, or becomes more rigid in her behaviours/expectations - or having real tantrums that seem an over reaction to the trigger then I would want her looked at again.

995,At my wits end...,"
        Asperger's Disorder is characterized by social difficulties and the presence of repetitive or stereotyped patterns of behaivor (e.g., proccupations, inflexible routines). Your son seems to be experiencing some social difficulties, but you did not mention repetitive behavior. I do recommend that you begin by sharing this information with your son's pediatrician. He is certainly experiencing some of the social challenges typical for 7-year-old children, but it seems that he is a bit more anxious than may be typical.

You mentioned difficulties with drop off at school and other social events. This behavior is probably related to his social challenges in those upcoming events. But, we know that parent reactions to separation difficulties play a major role as well. Here are some suggestions: (1) Evaluate the events that he has difficulties with, especially those that are nonessential. For example, does he seem to enjoy the play date. Do you consider this an important opportunity for him? Have you done what you can to make this activity enjoyable for him. (2) If you decide that the event is not important, consider dropping it. (3) If you decide the event is important, make it a routine and follow through. Avoid cajoling and bargaining about the event. (4) Use the same routine to drop your son off (e.g., hug and goodbye) and avoid lingering. (5) Return in a predictable way (e.g., at the same time). (6) Focus on the positive aspects of the event when you talk to your son about how it went. (7) If possible, work with others at the event to ease the dropp off. For example, ask the adult leading the event to greet him (or have a child greet him) immediately with a favorite toy or activity.

        You can google DSM IV Aspergers to read the diagnostic criteria.
Your post includes the following information that could be interpreted as being on the spectrum:
He needs routine.  Changes upset him considerably.
He needs to stick to rules rigidly and is very upset if he finds out he has broken the rules in some way.
He has alot of anxiety around social environments such as the bus, school, playdates.
He takes language literally.  He can't put it into context, or understanding teasing, or humour.
He has difficulties around social interaction and avoids them.
He obsesses about things - who said what.
He has sensory issues - he covers his ears at certain sudden unpredictable noise.

That is quite a list in your short post.  
What concerns me about your post is his level of anxiety.  Your child that doesn't have the 'freedom' of thought and response that a typical child would have becuase his understanding of language and social interaction is down to a literal interpretation of language.  And he has to stick to that rigid way to try to do things right.  I presume he gets very upset when he finds out that eventhough he tried to do/say the right thing, he still did it wrong!  That will be very confusing and frightening to him.  
I presume his language development was typical.  He didn't repeat words or phrases said by people to him or from TV.  I presume he never had difficulties with pronouns eg mixing up I, you, he, she, her etc.
Google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder and see if that sounds like your son.
Google Sensory Integration Disorder and see if that sounds relevant.
He is obviously struggling at school.  Or it might be just the transition from home to school that he struggles with and once he is there he copes better.  What does his teacher say?  He will definately find playtimes and dinnertime difficult because it is unstructured social time.  My son has an aide work with him to support him during playtimes.  He also goes to a Social Skills Club that is overseen by a Speech and Language Therapist.  He also goes to some dinnertime clubs.
Does his school have any experience of children with autism or aspergers?  Is he able to cope academically in the classroom?  Are they having to give him extra support?  Does he have tantrums or get very upset - and if he does how does the school deal with that?
My son goes to a school that is a mixture of mainstream children and those on the spectrum.  There is around 5 children per class on the spectrum.  As my son is also suspected to have dyslexia and dyscalculia he is in a class with other children who are struggling academically - yet his cognitive ability has been assessed as higher than average.  
But I cannot emphasis how important the right school is.  I moved my son to his current school.  
Your son is now 7.  It will become harder when he hits the teenage years because children can be very cruel to anyone who is different.  
If you want a diagnosis I would advise you go to your doctor and ask for a referal to professionals who have experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders including Aspergers.  I would also ask for a referal to an Occupational Therapist (for the sensory issues).  What are his other senses like: sight, sound, smell, taste, texture, touch, balance and co-ordination.  
Does he have any obsessions?  These can be anything he is very interested in.  If he does try to see if there is any kind of club that involves that type of thing.  My son is very interested in wars and fighting some he has just begun foil fencing lessons.  Usually team games are a no-no due to the social side of things and having to work as a team is something alien to them.  Try for small group or one to one stuff eg. trampoline, fishing, martial arts, rock climbing etc.  If his anxiety is such an issue also mention that to the doctor.  But it maybe that if he has a much more structured environment in a school that understands what these children need (usually alot of visual support eg. visual timetables, work given visually as well as verbally - structured playtimes etc - then his anxiety should reduce.  His anxiety is fueled by not being able to predict outcomes or understand anything other than the literal interpretation of language and rules.  Without that rigid interpretation it all appears like chaos to him and he literally doesn't know what to do.
You can also start with talking to him about things like 'everyone makes mistakes sometimes', 'we all try to be good but sometimes things can make us angry/upset but we can make things right by saying sorry'.  All these types of things will help him rectify things when he finds out he has broken a rule etc.  Does that make sense.  You need to teach him these things because he won't pick it up automatically like the rest of the children do.  For ages my son wouldn't attempt to draw/colour/write because he was so anxious about getting it wrong.  We had to explain to him for a long time that not getting it right is okay.  That people practice for a long time to get things right etc.  Now he will attempt things and he isn't so upset when things don't turn out to plan.

        I've just thought of some other things I wanted to add.
Every child on the spectrum is different.  I do know of other children, who like your son, need to stick rigidly to rules and behaviour.  For example one mother has a son who gets very upset if the other children in the class don't sit quietly and get on with their work!  Those types of things wouldn't annoy my son.  The background noise would bother him because of the sensory issues involved ie. he would find it hard to concentrate.  But if someone was being naughty he might find it funny.  My son doesn't seem to need to keep to these types of rigid ways of thinking.  But he does need things to happen as he has been told.  He has to be forewarned of change and then he is okay with it.
Another thing I wanted to say is that eventhough english is their native language, it is more like it is their learnt second language because they don't get the subtle meanings, double meanings, sayings, humour etc.  I read an article about a gifted autistic savant who can learn a new language within a week.  But eventhough his native language is English he prefers to live abroad because his difficulties are always put down to him 'being a foreigner'.  And that made me think of a language mistake I made whilst living in Greece which is typically autistic (although I am not autistic myself).  There was a group of us sitting on the balcony one evening, looking down over the town, and a Greek woman said (in Greek)  ""the mosquitos are not biting tonight"".  So I said (in Greek), ""no they are not biting me either because i've used insect repellent"".  And everyone collapsed in laughter leaving me feeling very silly and I had no idea why what I had said had been funny.  Then they explained that it is a Greek saying which means that ""there are not many people out and about, so business will be poor tonight"".  But someone with autism/aspergers is making these kind of language mistakes all the time - and it is because they have literal interpretation of each word.  Just make a mental note, when you are at work, how many times someone says something that isn't literal eg. 'pull your socks up' 'get a life' 'why the long face' 'cat got your tongue' 'give us a break' etc etc.

998,Violence and Aspergers,"
        In my experience (strong family history of Asperger's, I have it, and so do two of my sons), Asperger's and violence are not necessarily linked. What I mean by that is that it isn't classic for us to be angry, violent, mean people. 

I am wondering whether your nephew is on meds. Soem medications affect people on the spectrum differently than the same med would affect a normal person. Our brains are wired diferently and don't react the same way. This is what my kid's psychologist told me when discussing the subject of meds. 

I am not a big fan of video games or TV, especially for spectrum kids, but there's nothing you can do about that. Why the heck are they wiping his butt?? Asperger's people are not incapable of doing this! 

I think someone needs to get him back to a doctor to discuss meds.

        I am a mum, not a professional.
My son (age 8) is about to begin a listening therapy called Listening With the Whole Body.  It is a programme that the Occupational Therapist has been trained in and which she says has clinical evidence  of improvements in all areas of functioning ie. speech, sensory integration, social interaction etc.  It is not an invasive therapy.  So if your son has sensory issues I think you should get an OT involved, and also physio if he needs it, because movement is associated with brain development.
When do his symptoms become so mild he isn't considered autistic anymore?  That can only happen if he progresses enough in one of the diagnostic areas to lose a full blow diagnosis which may then be changed to PDD NOS or traits of autism.  Your approach to autism appears to be to find a cure.  And I am glad that your son has had such positive improvements over time, but autism is neurological and cannot be cured.  He will always be wired up differently.  If he has semantic speech difficulties google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder.  But bear in mind that the loss of a diagnosis could mean he doesn't receive supports as an adult.  This is only my opinion, but I want all professionals who come into contact with my son to know that he is on the autistic spectrum so that he is treated appropriately.  My son is high functioning autistic and goes to a mainstream school.  So depending what country you are in be very careful and find out what supports he might lose (in school for example), if you pushed to have his diagnosis changed or removed.  Obviously professionals cannot change the diagnosis to your wishes, but if he does improve in one area they might agree to change it to something like PDD NOS.  But that might mean your son loses social benefits, systems, therapies or supports in the process.  I have fought (solicitors and courts) to ensure that my son is supported as he should be and if, when he is an adult, if he is coping so well that he decides he doesn't need the label then he can go about having it removed.
Also have a look at Central Auditory Processing Disorder as that frequently plays a part in speech problems.  Also look at Irlen Syndrome if your son has sensory issues because many autistics find wearing the glasses reduces or removes visual sensory processing problems and also has a knock on effect on the other sensory systems.

        I haven't read the book, but i've heard about it.  There are a number of therapies out there, but only a few that are recognised by the medical profession because there is clinical evidence that there are improvements.  
As I have some sensory issues, as well as some auditory processing problems, as well as night blindness, I can imagine how difficult it must be for any child on the spectrum to be able to sit in a classroom and hear instructions and understand what they should be doing.  Anything that helps with that has got to be a bonus.  I'm thinking of having myself tested for Irlen Syndrome because I have such eye strain with lights, and when I borrow my son's glasses I can actually feel the tension drain away from my eyes.  And you don't get the same effect with sunglasses.

        I know, I am looking for a cure. Not for Autism though- for each symptom he has. And I do know that even if each symptom gets fully treated  he will still have a brain that is wired differently and thats why we're actual homeschooling now.  We noticed right away that  he wasn't going to learn in the classroom- even with the  spec. ed teacher in there. He learns best when things are clear and blunt and fun but repeditive. So we pulled him out and instead set up  a few  social sittuations  that  he can be succefull in instead of lost in. (figure skating- which helps with his muscle tone and the teacher by coinsidance is an OT-lol! Violin lessons and a play group). Any way thats a bit off subject. I am positive I want to try a listening therapy there are just so many out there and the prices are extreemly inconsistant. then there are also places that offer in -home  but its their therapist and equipment and there are places that just sell the equipment  and you do a training. I looked at the Georgian website  link that was posted above- that place looks reputable  but  how does that compare to Tomatis or Berard- has anyone done any research of the differences?

        I am in the UK and I presume you are in the USA?
The route I took was firstly to identify that my son had an auditory processing disorder.  Google Central Auditory Processing Disorder.  If that sounds like your son you can go to your GP and ask for a referal for asessment of that.  In the UK audiologists cannot assess or treat CAPD because they just don't do it, although they recognise that it is a medical condition.  So I found a centre that took Health Service referals and I asked my GP to request funding for this treatment as it was suspected that my son had this recognised disorder but the NHS in the UK could not treat him.
Suddenly - as if by magic - my local Occupational Therapist department got in touch with me and said that one of their OTs had recently been trained with a programme called Listening With the Whole Body.  The OT told me that this listening therapy does have clinical evidence of improvements.  
So maybe you could see if that is a possible route for you to take, to try and get it funded through the health system.
I also had my son tested for Irlen Syndrome.  That is worth looking into because it just involves wearing glasses with tinted lenses, and if the child has sensory integration and modulation difficulties there is a very good chance he has Irlen Syndrome.  I found that wearing the glasses dramatically reduced the amount of headaches my son had, and he just seemed much more capable when he wears them.  He makes much more eye contact and talks more and doesn't stim so much and tolerates so much more than he does without them.  And it was the Irlen practitioner I met in the UK who mentioned to me about listening therapies.  There are many autistic adults who say wearing the lenses has dramatically changed their perceptual abilities.

1004,Excited Jumping ,"
        Your son's teachers probably recognize that repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping are common among children with autism spectrum disorders. However, a diagnosis of autism requires delays in language and social develpment in addition to the presence of repetitive behavior. So, I would not be concerned about an autism spectrum disorder if you son is on track developmentally. However, I certainly recommend that parents share all developmental concerns with their child's pediatrician. It is important to recognize that typically developing children also show repetitive behavior common among children with autism. Nevertheless, this behavior is drawing negative attention to him. I recommend that you and the teachers interrupt this behavior when it occurs and encourage him to do something different. Try to be as neutral as possible when you do this. If the repetitive behavior appears to occur most often when your son is bored, work to be sure that he has some appropriate activities available that he finds stimulating. If the repetitive behavior occurs when he is excited, work with him to encourage him to show excitement in another way.

        It sounds as though the behavioral issues that prompted the evaluations related to his cooperation with work and his complaints about the level of work. To me, this strongly suggests working with the school to be sure that he is working at the right level and is properly motivated. Lack of eye contact during just some of his testing does not make me concerned about social deficits such as those seen in children with Asperger's. Your description does not seem to fit that profile. Nevertheless, a diagnosis can only be assigned based on thorough, in-person assessment by a qualified professional. If you and the school have concerns about his development, I recommend that you have him evaluated. Unfortunately though, a diagnosis on its own will not resolve the problems he is having at school. Independent of the outcome, his school will need to work to build on his strengths, address his behavioral issues, and find ways to motivate him.

        I am a parent of a child on the spectrum, not a professional.
The interesting thing I saw in your post was that the SP thought he performed okay when participating in something he was interested in.  Sometimes that is how those on the spectrum are.  My son will engage and make eye contact and take turns etc if you are doing something he is interested in.  He also was assessed by a SP as having age appropriate expressive language.  I disagreed with this because I knew that my son was using alot of language he had lifted from other people/TV/DVDs etc but uses them appropriately, and he does have a good vocabularly in his areas of interest.  In the end I paid a private SP who had experience of autistic spectrum disorders as well as attending Educational Tribunals.  I told her all my concerns and she carried out extensive assessments on my son.  Her results confirmed my suspicions.  For example can your son listen to verbal instructions and carry them out; can he listen to a story and deduce information from it; does he have any Auditory Processing or Processing Delays; does he understand humour; can he multi-task from a sensory point of view eg. can he listen and look; does he ever appear deaf when you call his name.
Google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder and see if that sounds relevant to your son.  If I were you I would also want a SP with experience of speech disorders as well as speech disorders associated with autistic spectrum disorders.
Does your son socialise generally on the same level as his peers?
Does he have interests or obsessions?
Does he have any sensory issues?
Does he throw tantrums?
Does he get upset at changes in routine or doing things in a different way.
It is quite possible he is gifted.
My son had a range of percentiles ie. 93% in areas such as spatial awareness and pattern recognition against a 2% for understanding verbal instructions.  Most of his other scores were around average, but again he got much better results on other tests that were carried out which did not depend on language - however my son is High Functioning Autistic and not Aspergers.
Can you give some details about the behavioural issues?
You can also google DSM IV for the diagnostic criteria for Aspergers to see what it is.

Thank for the reply! I re-read my post and perhaps I made a long story too short. I didn't supply enough information.

 For example can your son listen to verbal instructions and carry them out; can he listen to a story and deduce information from it; does he have any Auditory Processing or Processing Delays; does he understand humour; can he multi-task from a sensory point of view eg. can he listen and look; does he ever appear deaf when you call his name. 

 He doesn't have a problem with verbal instructions. He can listen to a story and tell gist of story and tell you story in detail. He doesn't have any Processing delays. He understands humor quite well. He comes up with his own jokes. He can listen and look. Sometimes he will not answer my questions, but if I call his name he doesn't have a problem, unless he's watching TV.(LOL) 

 
Does your son socialise generally on the same level as his peers? 
 He likes to play with children younger, same age, and older.

Does he have interests or obsessions?
 This is the most difficult question to answer. He loves cars, planes, trains, and subs, but cars are his favorite. My husband and I collect cars, so cars is the number 1 subject in my house. 

Does he have any sensory issues?
 Yes, he has sound and textile sensitivities. He is also emotionally sensitive.
 
Does he throw tantrums?
 No.
 
Does he get upset at changes in routine or doing things in a different way.
 At home he doesn't have a problem, but he does at school.

1008,Does this sound like Aspergers??,"
        It is common for children on the spectrum to find the school environment much harder because they are dealing with so much more from an incoming sensory processing point of view, as well as having to work out what they should be doing in class.
The difference between 'autistic spectrum disorder' and 'aspergers' tends to be that those with aspergers tend to have more obsessions and their development of speech tends to be age appropriate.  However, most parents of children diagnosed with Aspergers still say that their children have language problems specifically with semantics, eg. they take language literally.  Please google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder and tell me if that sounds like your son.
Is your son able to organise, plan and sequence his work.  Does he have good time management.  If not google Executive Function Disorder to see if that sounds like a possibility.
Also google Sensory Integration Disorder as the sound and tactile sensitivities could be down to that.  SID can affect any/all of the senses and it is also about modulation so sensory perception and processing varies throughout the day and day to day.  So my son may appear deaf when I call his name, cover his ears if I put the vaccum on, enjoy making noise like popping balloons, go to and enjoy drum club, throw a tantrum because there is too much noise in the classroom.  And all that differing response can happen in the same day.  Other days he copes as everyone else.  The senses are visual, auditory, tactile, smell, taste, balance and co-ordination.
Another cause of auditory problems is Central Auditory Processing Disorder.  This can cause several problems eg. the person may not be able to habituate to background noise, they may hear sounds differently causing the mispronounciation of letters/words, appearing deaf, not being able to home in on a person speaking if others are also speaking in the same room.  I have this problem myself.
What is your sons handwriting like?
Those on the spectrum also don't tend to have any desire to please parents/teachers/peers etc.  This can come across as being non-compliance, argumentative etc because they will do things in the way they want to do them and they will believe that their way is the right way.  They also want to stick with the things that they are good at and avoid everything else.
He may have some traits of Aspergers, but not enough to get a diagnosis.  But his speech needs to be assessed by a professional who has experience of speech disorders in general and also those associated with those on the spectrum.  The SALT is also the person to assess a child's social interaction skills.
If he is given the all clear by the SALT in both those areas then he can't be given a diagnosis of Aspergers.  But in the areas he does have difficulties eg. sensory an Occupational Therapist should assess him and give advice to school on how to help him cope and not become overwhelmed or frustrated in school.  He should also be screened for CAPD if you think its relevant.
Being able to retell a story is not the same as being able to understand the meaning behind it and then use that knowledge and apply it in another situations.  A concrete thinker with high ability maybe able to deduce the meaning behind the story, but may not be able to apply that knowledge into other situations.  An experienced SALT would be able to assess these abilities.
If he needs routine and structure then he won't conform and do things a different way because the way he knows will appear better to him.  And doing things in a different way makes the thing you are doing different or even unrecognisable for some children on the spectrum.  So there is a rigid way of thinking, a concrete/inflexible way of doing things.  This can also cause problems with generalisation ie. a child will learn to do a task in a certain way, and if any aspect of that task is changed (and that may be the environment, the day/time, the persons present, the order in which it is done etc) they are unable to do it.  The severity of this varies from child to child, but a gifted child with Aspergers or traits of Aspergers may just come across as being awkward and refusing to do things differently.  Would your son object if you took a different route to school or to the shops?  Are there any other instances you can think of when he wants to stick to  his way of doing things rather than another way (which may be quicker and easier than his way).

 Please google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder and tell me if that sounds like your son. 

 No, he does not take language literally, sarcasm runs high in my house. He scored a 155 In Antonyms.

 He does enjoy pleasing his parents. As in nonconformist (Ex. Friday night is is movie or game night. I brought up the idea of playing Planet Earth, witch they both enjoy playing. My son will wait till everyone has answered and give a different answer. When I told him we were going to play the game, he was fine with it. He was looking for a reason to argue. Saturday night we told the boys to get ready, b/c we were taking them out to dinner. My son started complaining he didn't want to go to that restaurant, but could not come up with a place he wanted to go. When I said ""it's there or home"" the tune soon changed.

 Handwriting: he holds his pencil add, but has neat writing. He scored above average in coordination and gross and fine motor skills.

 If I head in a different direction to go to the store, he will notice and ask where we are going, but he doesn't have a problem if we go a different way.

 Sometimes he wants to do thing his way, but I can easily convince him there's another way(If he sees it to be faster or easier) We have always taught the kids, that there is always more than one way to do things, just b/c someone does it differently, doesn't mean it's wrong.


 My husband and I have been discussing this issue for a while now, and have come to the conclusion that we will be making an appointment with a child Psychologist who has lots of experience with gifted children.

          Thank you so much for the replies!! What I see at home and what the teacher sees, seem to be different. I'm going to call his teacher today and ask if I can sit in the class for a day or two. I want to see what she is seeing. I'm hoping this will be beneficial, or it may confuse me even more.(LOL)

1012,Does this sound like Aspergers??,"
        It may help to see him in school, but he may act differently when he sees you there.  But my son was much more 'autistic' in school than at home.  I think in school there was just too much going on and he just retreated into his own space.  Schools are very noisy places, not how it used to be when I was at school.  In my sons class each table was doing a different activity, and instructions were given out verbally.  My son had no idea of what he should be doing and just seemed to drift around the classroom.  And when they tried to engage him or get him to attempt his work (which he couldn't do because he didn't understand what was expected of him), he would show avoidance behaviours and get upset.  
But school specifically has everything that someone on the spectrum struggles with.  It is all about language when they either have very poor understanding of language, or auditory processing or auditory memory problems.  It is full of social interaction whereas home is quieter with just family members.  There is lots of organising and planning and deducing information and experimentation in school when most have problems with these executive functions.  There is also much more sensory processing in every sense for children who may find even a quiet place too distracting.  
Hope the observations give you a better insight.
If he can put together a good constructive argument maybe he has a future in law??

        The type of interactions that you describe (e.g., hugging, talking about marriage) are actually not atypical for children your grandson's age. So, I would not be particularly concerned, although it is important to begin teaching all children appropriate social boundaries. It would be a good idea for his family and school to work together to address social behavior and performance issues that are of concern. Also, you are wise to monitor his development carefully, given the family history of autism spectrum disorders. I certainly recommend sharing all concerns about develpment with a child's pediatrician.

        It is worth checking wether your grandson needs a diagnosis to get input in school from people like a Speech and Language Therapist.  These are the professionals who look at social interaction skills in the UK, if you are somewhere else check to see if it is part of their job.  He will need to be taught the difference between family, friends and strangers and taught different ways of saying hello to them.  At 6 it is not too bad - maybe just starting to look a little inappropriate - but the SALT should put together a programme for this in school.  My son goes to a Social Skills Club that is overseen by a SALT.  My son also has an adult to support him with play and social interaction during playtimes and dinnertimes.  My son is diagnosed with high functioning autisim.   I think the difficulty alot of children with 'Aspergers' have is that they are just considered too capable.  But as you see for yourself, they do not pick up social communication and behaviour automatically by interacting with other children.  They need it to be taught to them like it is a lesson and once they have learnt it in one environment eg. school they have to be taught to transfer that skills into other environments eg. home etc.
Google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder.  See if that sounds like your grandson.  If it does then maybe that as a diagnosis might be more acceptable to the family, and, as it is a speech disorder (closely associated with being on the spectrum), in the UK it means the child will have access to a SALT throughout his school years because it is a 'disorder' and therefore will be with the child for life.
You can also find out about Social Stories.  This is a way of giving information to children.  His school or an Educational Psychologist should be able to show you how these work.
You could also consider Play Therapy, but you would need to find a PT who has experience of working with children on the spectrum and who uses a system similar to Greenspan floor time where she will get down with the child (and eventually introduce other children) and can model back behaviour and talk through emotions and thought processes of social interaction and playing as it is happening.
There are also games you can buy about these types of issues.  I know my son's school has some, but I don't know where they got them from.  So there would be a scenario and the child has to pick a card that is an appropriate reaction or behaviour to the scenario and also explain their reasoning for choosing that card.
If you are in the USA contact a national autism organisation and ask them to put you in the right direction.
You can also find out about local support groups.  It might be helpful for all the family to meet other families in similar situations especially if they do social stuff together so that their children and siblings can meet and play together.
Does your grandson have any awareness that he doesn't do things or react as his peers do?  Keep an eye out for that, although he has no diagnosis, he may need his difficulties explaining to him so that he doesn't start to get a negative image of himself.  Knowing that their is a reason can be positive because otherwise the child will label themselves as being stupid or weird.  And whether or not a child is diagnosed they will get labeled by those they come into contact with because they do stick out because of their behaviours or language or sensory issues etc.  There are many strengths and positives to being on the spectrum which are also worth knowing about as well.

        Autism is characterized by delays in language and social development and the presence of restricted or repetitve behavior patterns. It sounds as though you have concerns about your child's develpment in at least two of those areas. Therefore, I recommend that you seek a developmental screening for your child. It is very important to intervene early when any developmental delay is detected, so I recommend that parents share all concerns about development with their pediatrician.

        It might be worth having him checked to make sure he isn't on the autistic spectrum.  He is verbal, which is good, but a Speech and Language Therapist should assess his speech as well as his social interaction skills.
You say he won't join in or conform to nursery activities.  That maybe because he just wants to do what he is interested in (which is autistic behaviour).  My son was the same at nursery.  Can your son share toys and take turns with other children.  Does he play with toys in the way they were intended or does he play with parts of toys.  Does he spin or flap.  Does he use language to chat, or does he only use it to get his needs met ie. to ask for a drink or say he is hungry.  Do you every talk to him and he appears not to understand what you say.  Does he ever repeat things you have said to him back to you or repeat things he has seen/heard on TV/DVDs?
Does he get upset with changes or transitions.  Does he need to keep to a routine.
Does he have any repetitive behaviours?
Does he have any sensory issues eg. not liking hair being washed/brushed/cut or nails cut.  Is he okay with clothing, smells and food.  Is his balance and co-ordination okay.  Does he ever appear deaf or appear not to feel pain?

Thanks for the reply I have to say reading through your post yes is the answer to a lot of what you have listed.  to respond, no sharing is a no no at the moment but it is improving and taking turns is hard work for him to comply with but again is improving.  in relation to playing with toys he mainly plays with his cars.  He likes the movement of the wheels and can notice if the wheels do not move in unison, you know the way you have cheap cars where the bar is thin the wheels move up and down as well as around and he will keep telling you that it is broken.  he doesnt spin or flap.  He does chat, actually he yaps all the time.  Yes to the question of do you talk and he appears not to understand a lot of the time he will do that and repeat back what he last said to you as opposed to what you asked him.  he doesnt like change and is very particular about his clothing as in if there is a string hanging off anything you have to cut it off, the seam on his socks has to go across his toes.  his coat must be zipped up or buttons closed.  His balance is not great he is very cautious when he moves but coordination wise he's not bad.  His hearing seems fine and yes he does feel pain.  based on this what do you think???

1018,SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL QUESTIONS OF 3YR OLD,"
        I think you should go to your child's paediatrician and say that you are concerned about his communication and social interaction skills.  Mention being on the autistic spectrum and say that you want professionals experienced in diagnosising autistic spectrum disorders to assess him.  The first professional will be a speech and language therapist.  They will assess his expressive and receptive speech.  Sometimes there is a huge difference.  A child maybe talking and appear to have typical communication skills, but their difficulty is with receptive speech ie. understanding what people are saying to them.  These children are sometimes echolalia (they repeat what is said to them or things they have heard on TV or DVDs).  Sometimes they give totally unrelated answers to questions you ask them.  Sometimes they just don't respond to what you have asked them to do.  
If he is on the spectrum he is at the higher functioning end because he is speaking.  But he may need alot of speech therapy and by the time he is going to nursery/school he may need alot of structure and visual supports such as a visual schedule etc.  
An experienced SALT should be able to tell you whether a child looks like getting a diagnosis of being on the spectrum.  She should also assess for Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder.  I don't know if he is too young to assess for that yet, but many children at the higher functioning end of the spectrum have this.  Google it to see what it is.  Also google Executive Function Disorder as he may shows signs of that.
A need for things to be perfect visually can be typical of being on the spectrum.  My son will notice the most minute difference in things and things have to be just so.  He too wraps himself up and his socks, shoes, coat have to be on and done up in a precise way.  The seams on the socks may be down to a tactile sensory thing.  What is he like with having his hair brushed, cut or nails trimmed?  
An Occupational Therapist should assess his balance and co-ordination and you can google Sensory Integration Disorder to see what it is and see if that sounds relevant.  Is he okay with smells, taste and textures of food?  
You say he talks all the time.  But is it a two way conversation or is he talking at you.  My son (who is 7) talks to me, but how he does it is different to other kids.  He isn't necessarily watching for my response to what he is saying or even looking to see if I am interested.  He is telling me about something he is interested in or that he found funny.  He doesn't really need or want me to contribute to the conversation.  It is rather like giving a statement than two way communication.  Obviously your child is alot younger.  But what does he way to you?
Sharing and taking turns is difficult for those on the spectrum, but they can learn this skill.  My son couldn't do it at nursery, but he is alot better now. 
As you have concerns I think it would be best to start the ball rolling.  If he isn't on the autistic spectrum then he won't get a diagnosis.  But if he is he needs to start therapies as soon as possible for the best outcome.
As you are in Ireland, you could contact the national autistic society on www. nas.org.uk.  They should be able to give you some information relevant to where you are.

        I would also add that at his age you couldn't compromise with my son.  He wanted to do what he wanted to do and he wanted to do it in his way and be left alone to do it.  Any attempt to move him to something else, or stop him to eat or leave the house etc would involve tears and tantrums.  He came across as a very strong willed spoilt child, when actually he was autistic.  At nursery he didn't join in with the other children and he didn't want them to join in with him.  He liked to sit on his own doing puzzles or lego.  He played with toys as they were supposed to be played with.  He would notice the smallest details and pick up fluff off the floor or remove pieces of cotton etc.  If he was doing something and I tried to help him he would throw a tantrum.  Obviously he is alot better now, and he didn't get a diagnosis until he was nearly 5 because it was only when he started school and his teacher could see that he simply couldn't follow verbal instructions or join in with other children that she raised her concerns.  He was also very unhappy at school and nearly every day he would be in tears and throwing tantrums at school.  No parent wants that for their child.  You need your child to be happy in school so that they are motivated to learn, not hating every minute and waiting for home time.

1021,SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL QUESTIONS OF 3YR OLD,"
        If the playschool are concerned, then I think you should go to your GP and begin the process.  If a child is on the spectrum it is usually around this age that they start to have problems because their peers are beginning to develop their language and social side, whereas these children aren't progressing.
For assessing his sensory issues I found a book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers by Olga Bogdashina very useful.  At the back of this book there is a caregivers questionnaire that you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.  The Autism Outreach Department in our city invited Olga to speak to professionals and parents and they use her questionnaire to get sensory profiles of the children.  So I know it is reputable.  An Occupational Therapist can also assess using something like the Winn Dunn assessment questionnaire - waiting times for OTs are long (we waited 2 years in the UK).
Overall it took 18 months for my son to get a formal diagnosis, although the speech therapist told me to expect autistic spectrum disorder as a diagnosis when she saw him some 14 months earlier.  So an experienced SALT should be able to tell you whether to expect that as a diagnosis.
Because it takes so long for observations and assessments to take place in school and home it needs to be started as soon as possible because he will be due to start school soon and he may need supports in your local school or even a different school from your local one.  It is very hard at the beginning to even consider different schooling options etc, and you may need to wait and see if he achieves or fails in the local school environment.  But you need to start finding out about what is available out there and what your son's educational rights are by law.  Do you think your son will be able to cope in mainstream infant school without supports?  If he is giving unrelated answers to questions that would indicate that he isn't going to understand classroom instructions.
My son was diagnosied in March 2007 and by that time all the special needs places in mainstream schools were full.  So I had to get him in through the backdoor and also go to an Educational Tribunal.  
If you find an infant school that has experience and expertise in autistic spectrum disorders (and your son is in the process of getting a diagnosis of that) then that is the place he may be best suited.  In England they have mainstream schools that are Enhanced Resource.  This means they have mainstream children and a set amount of special needs places.  In my case, eventhough the special needs places were full I managed to get him a mainstream place and moved him to that school.  Once they had offered him a place they couldn't withdraw it on the grounds of his special needs because that would have been breaking the Disability Discrimination Act, and as he was in the process of getting a Statement (do children get Statements of Special Educational Needs in Ireland?), by law that school had to meet the requirements of that Statement whether he had a special needs place or not.  I went to an Educational Tribunal because I wasn't happy with the amount of support being offered in his Statement.  I went to tribunal and got everything I asked for because I had evidence that he needed it.
It isn't your job to make things right.  The Playschool is right to raise concerns.  Now you need to pass those concerns onto your sons paediatrician and ask him to refer you to a team of professionals who are experienced in diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  This will include a SALT, Clinical/Educational Paediatrician, Clinical/Educational Psychologist - if you think he has sensory issues then request an assessment by an Occupational Therapist.  Don't be put off if they say it takes years, make sure you are put on the waiting list.
I tried to raise concerns about my son at about the same age, but was basically fobbed off.  So the infant school raised their concerns when he had been there for around 6 months.  He was a very unhappy little boy in that school, and I do regret not pushing and demanding assessments when he was 3+.  But back then I didn't know what I know now.  Please remember that all therapies/supports etc run on budgets and unfortunately no-one is going to encourage you to have your son assessment because if they find something they have to find the funding to meet his needs.  So please make sure that his needs are fully assessed and that all professionals also give recommendations as to how those needs will be met in school during lessons and during playtimes/dinnertimes.  
If you do have Statements in Ireland I am happy to send you a copy of my son's Statement for you to see the level of support that can be achieved in school.
In the UK the local authority has a Parent Partnership service which is there to help parents navigate their way through the process of a diagnosis and supports in school.  You could contact your local educational department and ask them if there is a similar service.

        Sally thanks a million for all your advice.  I am so baffled by all this at the moment and scared at the same time.  I feel helpless and totally lost but thanks to you at least I have the termonology to at least sound as though I know what I am talking about.  He is under a specialist at the moment for problems with his bowels.  We have been attending for over a year now.  From your last message I got on to the Autistic Society of Ireland's website which was fab in plain and simple language and I saw that toiliting can be an issue for kids on the Autistic spectrum.  I moved his appointment forward from the end of march to the 9th Feb to see if I can get concrete answers about his bowels i.e I want them to do a scan of his bowel to see if the problem is with his bowel or if not is it a behavioural thing and if it is a behavioural thing then could it be causing these other issues or are the other issues causing the problem with the bowel.  I am hoping for the specialist to refer me to the Psychology Department through the hospital seeing as his file is there already and maybe I could bypass even one of the waiting lists.  I found a centre here also that has a private assessment clinic for Autism Spectrum Disorders where they do a multi assessment i.e. speech therapist, occupational etc.  it is €1,500 for the test.  I am attracted to this for 2 reasons, first being there is only a max waiting list of 3months and 2nd all the professionals are under one roof but the down side is they are looking mainly for disorders on the Autistic Spectrum and if he is assessed and proves not to be on the spectrum we will have to still go through the assessment process for say ADD/OCD etc. They told me that if it is not Autism, they may suggest what it might be and then point us in the direction of having him assessed for that.   I dont know what to do.

1023,SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL QUESTIONS OF 3YR OLD,"
        Find out what the qualifications and experience of the professionals in this centre are.  How long they have been diagnosing ASDs.  
What standardised tests they will do.  I'm presuming it will be a mixture of standardised tests (these are set clinical tests to test for abilities), as well as observation and interacting with the child to see how they react.
Make sure you write down beforehand every kind of communication problem you notice eg. giving unrelated answers to questions, repeating what people say or words/phrases from TV/DVD, does he mix up pronouns eg. me, I you, she, does he pronounce words incorrectly eg. map or nap, does he have a strange accent or place the emphasis on the wrong section of the word, does he interact just to get his needs met.  
For one day make a diary of everything he says to you to show how often he is interacting and what he is saying as well as everything he does.  
On that day you can set up the house so there are things for him to do, but don't sit down and play with him unless he requests it, and if he doesn't request it after a significant amount of time (eg. 30+ minutes) try to join in with him and see what his reaction is.  Does he try to include you in his play, is he paying any attention to you at all, try to stop him playing with whatever he is doing and try to move him onto something else and see what happens.
He may be too young to test for semantic pragmatic speech disorder - but I would mention it to see how he can be assessed in the future.  
Write down all his social skills difficulties eg. not able to share or take turns, avoiding interaction or not interacting appropriately, can he sit on the carpet with the rest of the children at playschool, is he interested in his peers but doesn't appear to know how to interact, or is he totally disinterested in them.  At social gatherings what does he do, is he with the rest of the children or is he off doing his own thing.
Is he interested in colouring or painting.  Does he get upset trying to keep within the lines or does he insist that you do it for him or does he just refuse.
Write down any sensory behaviour eg. flapping, spinning, attention to detail, does he line up or stack toys, does he play with toys appropriately or does he play with bits eg. spin the wheels of cars, does everything have to be just so with clothes, toys, how things are done, does he need routine, does he get upset at change or transitions, is he oversensitive to hair brushing,washing,cutting, nails cut, socks and shoes, clothes tags.  Sensory difficulties including sight, sound, smell, taste, tactile, balance and co-ordination, so try to give examples of each sense ie. does he climb at all, does he climb without awareness of danger, does he scream if his feet leave the floor.  If he is always paying attention to bits of fluff or a piece of cotton or likes bright shiny things etc then write that down.  Does he not respond when you call his name, does he cover his ears if you put the vaccum on or does he like lots of noise.
Ask how long the assessments will be.  Will they assess on more than one occasion.  
Did you find this clinic through the Autistic Society of Ireland?
Do you know how long it will take for him to be assessed through the NHS in Ireland?
If you think they are reputable, and it saves you alot of time (maybe more than a year), then it is an idea to know if he is on the spectrum or not.  
You can still go to your GP and ask for a referal as well and use that as your second opinion.  Don't tell them you are going private as well at this stage as they may say they will wait for the private results.  When you have the results, if positive you can go back to your GP and tell them the outcome.  
The results can be forwarded to the various NHS departments.
Will the money you pay just go towards a diagnosis.  Or are they going to do full assessments and reports that will detail the needs of the child and give recommendations for the supports and provision he will require in school?  
If it is just to get the diagnosis, you will still need for the NHS professionals to assess individually as well to detail his needs and give recommendations regarding supports in school.  And you may find that those NHS professionals don't go into much depth.  But to honest, at his age, a diagnosis is the most important and a rough idea of the severity.  It may take some time for you to see what his difficulties are and the severity of them.  There are many assessments, for example those for dyslexia, that cannot be carried out until a child is age 7.  This is to do with typical neurological development and all 'typical' children should have a basic knowledge of reading and writing by age 7.  If by that age your child is still unable to read or write then you know you have problems.  That is why I also mentioned that they may not be able to test him yet for Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder.  
Speak with your local Education Department at the Council and find out what kind of schools are in your area that cater for children with a diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (or ADHD for that matter as they tend to be the same schools).  You may find there are some children in mainstream, some Enhanced Resource school (this is a mixture of mainstream and special needs - if you have that in Ireland), and some Special Schools (where all the children have special needs).  
Also ask if their testing is going to give you any indication of the kind of schooling that is most appropriate for your child.  
Regarding schooling, my personal opinion is that unless the child is high functioning Aspergers and academically brilliant, I think a school that is a mixture of mainstream children and those on the spectrum is the best - as long as the child is interesting in social interaction and the school provides the appropriate supports to make that social interaction successful and a positive experience.  If the child is quite severely autistic and isn't interested in other children and also is showing some learning difficulties as well - then a special school may be better.
Remember that any diagnosis can change if the child improves enough.  My son is much better now at 7 than he was at 4.5 when we got the diagnosis.  But he still needed to be in a school environment that had experience and expertise in teaching children on the spectrum because he simply wasn't making progress.
Find out if your authority does Statements of Special Educational Needs or some other kind of legal document.  The Autistic Society of Ireland should have information about that.  If they do, then as soon as the diagnosis issue is out of the way, you need to start working on that as most special educational places require the child to have a statement in the UK.  So your child will automatically go to a typical mainstream school without one.  So check how things are done in Ireland.
Infact, the above is more than enough for you to be getting on with for now.  When you have a diagnosis in 3 months time you can email me.  Send me a private message via medhelp and I will reply to you with my email address.
Regarding bowels.  Does he have encopresis?

1024,Help for my son,"
        Obviously your son has done quite well with your guidance and support, getting through college and living what sure seems to be a fairly independent life.  You mention that he has no social skills but I'm going to assume that he gets along well enough in a school setting, at least with his teachers. Socializing with peers seems to be a more pressing concern. There is no magic to learning social skills so searching out social skills building experiences would seem to be the best course of action.

As to your first question, Asperger's is a form of autism.  If you question whether your son has it then you should have a professional screen him.  All forms of autism are likely genetic disorders.  You mention other affected family members so there seems little reason to question that there is a genetic link.  Autism was discovered by Kanner and Asperger in the 1940s but was not well recognized as a common developmental disorder until much more recently in the early 1990s.  Many children are still not diagnosed until 8 or older and those children with mild forms of autism spectrum disorder likely still go undiagnosed.  Some debate exists in the research literature as to whether there is a useful distinction between high-functioning autism and Asperger's Syndrome.  The debate is fairly academic and not particularly relevant to figuring out how to tackle the problems one encounters when helping those with autism through life.  As a parent, you seem very dedicated to helping your son.  I suggest that you start looking into social skills groups.  If you searched on the internet for your town and autism groups, you will find that there are a number of groups within 50 miles of your home town (from Princeton NJ to Bethlehem, PA).  

Best of luck.

I was so glad to read your post. My son, 13 now was diagnosed with Asperger's 5 years ago. My husband refuses to acknowledge this & as a consequence there is always a stressful atmosphere at home. There is also no help group/person qualified to help us where we live in the Middle-East. He is high functioning & pretty good at his studies, very social, but has problems with eating certain foods, and absolutely no idea of time/responsibility, & gets irritable very easily. He also tends to switch off in class, & has problems organizing his books, clothes, notes etc. I am trying get in touch with a support group/qualified person, & also trying to get more info. about Asperger's.

        Delayed echolalia involves repeating words, sounds, or phrases that are inappropriate to the current context. Delayed echolalia often interferes with learning and may serve as a form of self stimulation. I recommend that you identify a hospital in an urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children with autism and other developmental delays. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations. You can then take these recommendations to your local school system. I also recommend that you seek the support of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, who would be able to conduct the appropriate assessments and to assist in developing an assessment and treatment plan for decreasing echolalia and increasing appropriate communication. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers.

        I am a parent of a 7 year old high functioning autistic child and I would disagree with the expert when she says the repeating of dialogue is inappropriate for the situation.  That is not true.  Indeed the higher the cognitive level of the child the more appropriate it is and in some circumstances it can fool professionals into thinking that they have advanced verbal skills.  An experienced Speech and Language Therapist who has experience of autistic spectrum disorders as well as speech impairments should be able to assess his speech and communication and social interaction skills.
Out of interest, also google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder to see if that is relevant.
Other indications are speaking with an accent.  For example my son is English but speaks with an American accent.  Also strange voice intonation or inflextion or emphasis or how words are pronounced. 
Echolalia is also an indication of a top down learning style rather than a bottom up learning style.  It means they learn things whole or in chunks rather than putting pieces of information together and analysing it.  If that is the case then his school work needs to be differentiated to take this different learning style into account.

        I recommended identifying a Board Certified Behavior Analyst who will be able to conduct the proper assessments and make recommendations for improving your son's behavior. The website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (bacb.com) has a list of certificants by state, which allows you to email local professionals.

A diagnosis of autism is made based on delayed language and social development and the presence of restricted or repetitive behavior patterns. I assume that your son is experiencing difficulties in each of these areas if he received a diagnsosis of autism. Unfortunately, the diagnosis alone does not tell you how to deal with the many behavioral challenges that you may experience. That's why I recommend that you also consult a professional trained to address the behavioral difficulties associated with autism and other disorders.

        If ABA isn't working then I think you need SALT, Ed Psych and Occupational Therapists to do assessments to find out what is causing the meltdowns.  There will be something.  It could be receptive language difficulties, or sensory integration.  There are so many things that you really do need to be a bit of a detective.  As your son is verbal, when he has calmed down after a meltdown, can you ask him what made him angry/sad.  Try not to ask 'why' because that is a hard question for them to answer.  But if you ask what made you bang your head, or you looked very angry - what made you mad?  Then just believe whatever his answer is.  Sometimes with sensory stimulation they can just get totally overwhelmed and not be able to identify what is upsetting them.  But in many cases competent professionals will be able to identify what is causing the difficulties.

        His Behavior Analyst is also the Educational Psychologist for our school district.  

What you said about asking him ""what"" instead of ""why"" makes a lot of since.  Every time we would ask him why he was crying he wouldn't know.   Maybe by asking ""what"" he would be able to identify what is was that actually got him crying.  I will pass the along to the  to his ""team"" at school and I will also try this at home.  

He has been on the Abilify for 3 days now and we have already to started to see an improvement.  Since he started it he has not had any ""meltdowns"" what so ever.

His teacher mentioned something to me the other day and I was wondering if it sounds like a sensory problem.  She was quizzing her class on their Science work and she said they were ""screaming"" out the answers.  She said my son was staring to get very ""worked"" up so before he started to have a ""meltdown"" she let him go and sit by the computer and put the earphones on to help buffer the loudness of the class and she said this helped him, he had calmed down.  What do you think?

        Unfortunately, many interventions and modifications to address ""sensory problems"" may exacerbate other forms of problem behavior. Data from a number of large scale studies show that the most common factor contributing to problem behavior is escape from unwanted tasks and activities. Therefore, I would be very cautious about ""sensory"" interventions that result in a child being removed from school work when he has problem behavior. Please discuss this with the behavior analyst with whom you are working.

        My son wears Irlen lenses (google Irlen Syndrome to see what that is).  He also has access to ear defenders in school and usually chooses to wear them for school assemblies.  If he doesn't wear them and it is noisy he either has a meltdown or gets totally overstimulated and retreats into his own world and effectively cannot engage for the remainder of the morning/afternoon.  The Occupational Therapist has also noted that he doesn't rely on them and will refuse them or take them off if he doesn't need them.  I think it would be helpful for an Occupational Therapist to assess him and his school environment to make sure that it is one of low arousal (if he is mainly hyper sensitive to things).  Some children fluctuate between being hyper and hypo sensitive to sensory stimulous so they may be touch sensitive at times and need tags removing from their clothes, yet at another time they may hurt themselves and not appear to feel any pain at all.  These are real problems of processing sensory information where the same stimulus can at times be pleasurable and at other times can be painful.  You can ask him ""does noise bother your ears.""  If he says yes, then that is the truth and how he experiences it.  My son cannot stand singing, or clapping, or sudden unpredictable noises.  Personally, I believe that if a child is showing avoidance behaviours and meltdowns then the environment and support structures need to be re-evaluated to make sure it is at a level that the child can cope in.  No-one with or without autism would stay in an environment that caused them pain or distress.
For more info on sensory issues you can google the name Olga Bogdashina and read an article by her printed in Autism Today.  She also has a book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  Our Autism Outreach department uses the questionnaire at the back of this book to get sensory profiles on the children.  I completed one for my son and found it very useful.  If your son is verbal the best thing you can do is to begin to explain to him that he maybe experiencing things differently to you and get him to talk about his experiences.  My son was amazed when I told him that I could not see/hear/feel the things that he could.  It is very frustrating for them to see their peers who are able to cope in situations when they cannot.  It affects self esteem.  It makes them think they are bad or stupid.  They are not.  We accept that a blind child cannot see.  Why can we not accept that, from what autistic adults tell us, in some way they too are deaf and blind.  Indeed autistic children have similar language impairments to deaf and blind children.  Some autistic children touch and tap their environments in the same way that blind children do.
But I would agree that this doesn't necessarily mean that removing him is the best solution.  He needs his environment adapted so that he can remain and he needs to be taught coping strategies so that he can request stress or sensory breaks.  There is alot that can be done.

        You could also google Central Auditory Processing Disorder to see if that sounds a possibility.  This is also a sensory processing disorder.  I have it and my son has problems with screening out different sound sources.  In a classroom environment I would not be able to hear what the teacher was saying if there were other sound sources.  My ears seem to have a life of their own and tune into different noises, speech apparently at random.  It is very frustrating.  I cannot hold a conversation in a nightclub or bar because I cannot hear what the person is saying to me if there is background conversations and music as well.  When I answer the phone I have to cover the other ear to screen out other noise.  I also frequently tune out and appear deaf to the extent that my husband has to repeatedly shout my name or touch me on the shoulder!

        I strongly recommend that you seek a developmental screening for your grandson. It might be best to start with his pediatrician. But, be sure that you have his language assessed by a speech pathologist. Because your grandson is showing delays only in language, I would not be particularly concerned about autism. A diagnosis of autism requires delays in language and social development as well as the presence of repetitive behavior. Because your grandson will be 3 shortly, he should qualify for some early intervention services through your public school system, depending on the results of his assessment. Early intervention is very important, so please encourage your son to seek an evaluation soon.

        Clonidine was initially used as an antihypertensive but it has come to be used to treat a variety of behavioral disorders including tics, symptoms of ADHD, aggression, PTSD, anxiety, panic disorder, or sleep problems.  Medication of this sort can be helpful and has shown to be most effective in conjunction with systematic behavioral programming.  As always, I recommend that parents have a close working relationship with the prescribing physician and understand exactly what the medication is, what it is intended to affect, what the side effects are, how direct and side effects will be monitored, and how decisions about dose increases and decreases will be made.

        I would want a second opinion.  I would go back to your GP/Paediatrician and tell them you want referring to a multi-disciplinary team that has experience of diagnosing autism and aspergers.  Have you googled DSM IV Aspergers/Autism/PDD NOS to get the clinical criteria the professionals are looking for?  As you will see any child only has to get some of the behaviours in the areas mentioned.  I would then begin making a daily diary of behaviours he shows that meets the criteria.
When my son was being assessed he was seen at home and school on a number of occasions by various professionals for the very reason that these children do tend to behave differently in different environments.  We were also asked to video him at home for them to look at.
I think you need to be referred to a centre that has deals exclusively with speech and communication disorders such as those on the autistic spectrum.  Other professionls simply dont always see the autism in the behaviours and it leaves the parents with no answers.  
Of course it maybe that your son does have a mixture of ASD and ADHD.  But again it takes time and numerous observations to make that decision.  It took over 18 months for my son to get a diagnosis and he was seen by around 5 professionals and each one saw him at least twice.

        Well 


Sensory difficulties
Language difficulties


Can be components of the Autism spectrum diagnosis

If not all components are present - you get PDD-NOS. 

Some people are arguing to include ADHD in PDD spectrum as it has so many sinilar traits; many treatments (behavioral management, visuals, etc) are similar as well

I would call it whatever it takes to get appropriate help. And really, if it clinician feels that it is ADHD with PDD traits - why not call it PDD and be done with it. It is not like it will be tatooed on his forehead, and it is not that one is ""better"" than the other. Severe ADHD may very well be a lot lower functioning then mild PDD.

Certainly - get a second opinion.

        It will be important for you to address your concerns about your son's sleep quickly given that another child is on the way. Your son will sleep in his bed if you require him to do so. Here are a few suggestions:
(1) Be sure that your son has a consistent bed time routine (e.g., bath, p.j.s, book, bed)
(2) Do what you can to reasonably ease his fears before placing him in bed (e.g., turn on a nightlight)
(3) Be sure his other needs are met (drink, potty) immediately before bedtime
(4) If he gets out of bed, simply return him with as little attention as possible
(5) It can be helpful to check in on a schedule (e.g., every 5 min) according to the clock, but not when he yells or gets out of bed
(6) Be sure to make time for attention and physical closeness outside of sleeping
(7) Be consistent and I expect that this plan will work in a few nights

It sounds like paper and the opportunity to draw are very important to your son. Therefore, I suspect that a powerful program could be built around allowing him to earn this opportunity when he displays other forms of appropriate behavior.

        Thank you for the suggestion. With Davey I do not think that would work as his drawings have to be portable. He has no less then three drawing boards, a blackboard in his room, as well as all the paper he wants. An entire box of computer paper (the BIG box) he used up in less then two weeks. He draws and when done with a paper it is tossed on the floor. He carts paper, maps and markers wherever we go......even on a short 2 minute trip to a local store. He even cuts up my old road atlas books and has states that he hides in his pockets.

Do have many chuckles about him though. When his class went to the library he had worn his mittens and they found crayons hidden in them. He was told he could look at the books but was not allowed to check them out and went into a panic so was sent to the vice principal's office for a time out. After hearing the vp tell him that his behavior was not acceptable he asked the vp for a map of Earth. The vp printed up a global map and was promptly told by Davey that he needed a differnet one because the one printed did not show Antartica.

        I do recommend that you get your son evaluated for Asperger's syndrome. But, the most important part of your question was ""what to do about it."" A diagnosis is sometimes helpful in gaining appropriate services but often does not really go far in explaining in the types of behavioral difficulties or in pointing toward intervention. I recommend that you attempt to identify a Board Certified Behavior Analyst who could assist you and your son's school with identifying some interventions aimed at addressing the behaviorall concerns that you identified.

        It is never too late to identify a concern with a child and to arrange for appropriate intervention to help her.  Early problems with hearing are often correlated with early delays in language, however, if you are concerned that there may be something else going on with your daughter, by all means have her assessed.  As heartbreaking as it can be to find out that your child has a particular delay or disability, postponing or avoiding assessment just delays finding treatment that would help her.  I absolutely recommend having her assessed and I will tell you what I’ve told others about identifying a person to assess her.  You are looking for a specialist in diagnosing autism and related developmental disorders.  Good choices include developmental pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, child psychiatrists, and child psychologists.  Make sure that the individual providing the diagnosis has experience in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders.  Your pediatrician, local hospital, or school district should be able to refer you to a qualified individual.  Regardless of who you are seeing, make sure that the diagnosis and the reasons for it are fully explained to you.  You shouldn't find yourself walking away confused about the diagnosis.  If you have any concerns, seek a second opinion and find a diagnostician you trust and are comfortable with.

        It sounds like the delays in your daughter's development are fairly pervasive, however, I am very encouraged to hear that you have found and continue to seek services for her.  Intervening early has been shown to be extremely beneficial and it seems that you have already initiated a range of important services.  The speech pathologist may be able to help with language delays, and the OT with problems related to the drooling.  I would also recommend seeking explicit treatment for the aggression and finger biting.  A good person to go to would be a board certified behavior analyst who has experience treating the types of behavior problems your daughter is exhibiting.  With appropriate intervention, the prognosis for successful treatment of aggression and self-injury is quite good.  I also can’t stress enough the importance of frequent contact and conversation with the individuals providing services.  Make sure that you understand the treatments put in place and that the data are frequently reviewed with you so that you are able to ascertain the rate of progress being made.  It is also crucial for you to identify components of treatment that are important for you to carry over into your daughter’s daily life.  For example, successful treatment of aggression typically involves arrangement of consistent contingencies for aggression and appropriate communication.  Anything that you can do in the home to keep these contingencies in place will add to the effectiveness and speed of the treatment.

1052,How can I tell if my son has Autism?,"
        Go onto the Autism forum and click on the Health Page icon on the top right hand corner of the page.  Click on ""Bhavioural Characteristics Behind a Diagnosis of Autism (ASDs).  I am a parent of a 7 year old child on the spectrum.  I have posted the DSM IV criteria for getting a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder, and parents have posted examples of their child's behaviour that meets the criteria.  That might help you recognise your own son in those behaviours.  You will see that any child only has to have a certain amount of the characteristics out of each section.  So no child will have all of the characteristics and every child will be different.
Regarding repeating questions, words etc - google Echolalia and Autism and also Perseverant Speech and Autism and see if that sounds like what he is doing.  If it is then he probably has a speech disorder that needs to be assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist.  She should assess his expressive and receptive speech as well as assess for Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder.  Difficulties with language and communication can cause many behavioural problems because they are struggling with something we do so naturally.
Also google Sensory Integration Disorder to see if that sounds relevant.  Is your son over or under sensitive in any of his senses?
Sometimes not caring about consequences is really that they cannot see the consequences of their actions - there is a difference.  Problems with predicting outcomes can be associated with poor Theory of Mind - google that to see if it is relevant.  If it is then poor TOM is associated with autistic spectrum disorders, as are the above disorders mentioned.
Tantrums, getting violent, very emotional, sudden outbursts etc are also typical of autistic spectrum disorders.  If there is a lack of control of emotions then triggers can cause them to be totally overwhelmed with emotions that they cannot stop or bring under control.  Alot of work has to be done to get your son to recognise his emotional state and to teach him appropriate ways of calming down and coping strategies.  Again a Speech and Language Therapist and Educational Psychologist should be working with you on this.  
If you have a gut feeling that there is something else, then that may well be the case.  My son has an ASD and I suspect he also has aspects of ADD.  All of my other gut feelings relating to his speech problems, dyslexia, visual problems etc have all turned out to be true.  
So look into the above mentioned disorders, as having any one of them will lead to enormous amounts of frustration and behavioural difficulties.  And then go to your GP and say although my son has a diagnosis of ADHD I believe he also has XXXX and I want him referred to professionals who have experience of diagnosing this disorder.
What is your son like off meds?  If taking them makes him worse, and there is no noticeable benefit to him being on meds, then I would speak with his GP about gradually weaning him off them for a time to see how he is.
As you probably know, disorders such as ADHD or ADS can also have anxiety and depression/bi-polar with them as well, so you will need to keep a very close eye on him when he is coming off meds.
Regarding meds, many people on the spectrum have posted saying that normal doses of medications can be too powerful for them.  So when trying anything new it might be worth discussions starting on a very very low dose and gradually increase over time if it is beneficial.
As he is verbal what is his reason for wanting to hurt himself and others?

        I agree with Sally. This could be aspberger's. My son has that and it was only diagnosed as PDD (which basically means ""I don't know whats wrong with your child"") it is annoying and nerve racking to not know whats going on. I took it upon myself to look into it and low and behold I found Aspbergers. It described my son to a perfect T. I just got frusterated again because no dr would agree with me. 4 Years of evaluations did nothing. On day on the verge of snapping I called our new pedi and plainly told him. I can't stand it anymore I don't even like this child anymore. (I love him dearly) dr asked what the behaviors were as I described them he stated ""sounds like aspbergers"" He told me to call this new psycopharmacologist we'd been seeing and tell him what I had just said. So I did, he agreed and imediately started Jake on abilify. What a hugh difference it made.
When this dr asked who told me it wasn't aspbergers and why. I told him the people in his now office and he wasn't because he didn't function academically at his age level. (he has a brain tumor that masked the aspbergers) I hope my story helps you. If you know in your gut what is wrong go with it.

        Thank you so much for your advice. It is so hard to handle a child that is having problems and you can even help him. My heart breaks when I start to get mad and him and then I look at him and I dont see anything behind his eyes.

Without his meds he is still a rollercoaster of emotions, but without some of the other side effects. He also does not sleep with out the meds. 

When he talks about wanting to hurt others or himself it is always becuase he is mad or frusterated. I guess that is his way of releasing anger.

I have spent many sleepless nights crying becuase I just want to help him. I know what you mean by ""not liking the child"" even though you love him with all your heart. You just become so angry and frusterated with the  behavior.

Thank you again.

1056,How can I tell if my son has Autism?,"
        I think if you understand that the 'meaning' behind the things he is saying isn't there that that helps.  My son has said many things, and I know he doesn't understand what he is saying.  For example, he saw once on TV a situation where somebody got mad and decided to pack their bags and leave.  Because he doesn't have the social insight, that is how he believes you resolve situations like that and he frequently threatens to 'leave home', and I have found him with his rucksack packed and ready to go.  I have to keep all doors and windows locked because he cannot predict the outcome of his actions.  Once I caught him in the back garden throwing bottles because he wanted to see if they were made of glass.  He couldn't tell by looking at them, but he knew what broken glass looked like.  He has frequently flooded the bathroom with his interest in water and pipework and more importantly blocking pipework!
I would go back to your doctor/paediatrician and say that you want assessments by professionals who have experience of diagnosising autistic spectrum disorders.  In the meantime I would read up about the different diagnosis and make a note of his behaviour on a daily basis and make notes of what you think is autistic and what you think is ADHD.  
Look at all other associated conditions as well.  Google Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder, Central Auditory Processing Disorder, Executive Function Disorder, Sensory Integration Disorder, Irlen Syndrome, Delayed Echolalia and Perseverant Speech, Theory of Mind. 
Many children with ADD/ADHD and/or Autistic Spectrum Disorders will have components of both conditions as well as any or all of the above mentioned disorders as well.  Some professionals will say 'we know that children with xxx have these types of difficulties', but the truth is that every child is different with different combinations of disorders and different traits of those disorders therefore IT IS IMPORTANT to know how each child is affected otherwise they won't get the supports and strategies and approaches and therapies that they need for their individual strengths and weaknesses.
So sit down, make a plan of action, and start working through the list.  It is a long slog - but worth it.

        I once again understand and agree with Sally44. one thing (and I am sure sally knows what I mean) you need to watch out for the PDD diagnosis. This is actualy a non-diagnosis. and basically means"" I don't know what the heck is wrong with your child."" Because PDD covers such a wide spectrum of disorders  and they are not all treated the same, different meds and treatments therapies work different for different disorders. For instance my son does well on abilify and in low key therapy and classroom situation. anything with too much stimulation is going to make him crack.

1058,intentional urinating,"
        One aspect of your description that is striking is not just that your student is incontinent, but also that she appears to be engaging some pretty inappropriate behavior in conjunction with the incontinence (disrobing, yelling, etc.).  The incontinence and the inappropriate behavior may or may not be related to one another, but both seem important to address.  If the two are related to one another, then it is possible that both the incontinence and the other inappropriate behavior serve a similar function – perhaps to access attention, or to avoid activities she does not like.  If that is the case, then your success with toilet training will also hinge on you and your fellow teachers re-arranging her environment so that she can access what she needs (be it attention, help or breaks from work, etc.) via appropriate behavior instead of the current inappropriate behavior.  Toilet training in isolation may not be enough to address the problem - you likely will need specific advice on how to determine why she is engaging the behavior and how to treat the problem.

There are several books available that provide step-by-step advice on toilet training in this population (“Toilet training in less than a Day”  by Nate Azrin and Richard Foxx is one example) that may provide some useful tips.  However, given the additional problem behaviors the child is exhibiting, I suggest that you contact a local Certified Behavior Analyst for more exact advice.  The BACB website has a local service provider directory at:
http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html

I presume that the family has already done so, but you might want to recommend that they take her to see the pediatrician to rule out any possible medical issues. Although it sounds as though the problem has been going on for quite some time now, it’s always best to rule out a medical cause when dealing with incontinence.

Best of luck to you all.

1059,intentional urinating,"
        You don't say how old the student is.
If she was toilet trained up until 3 years ago, something must have happened for her to regress.  It might have been to do with generalisation.  Those with autism can learn how to do things in one environment, with the same person, with the same prompts.  But if the environment, person or prompts change then they don't recognise the situation as being the same.  So, for example, a child may learn to tie their shoelaces at home, but be unable to do the same task at school.  
However she is now in the routine of wearing diapers.  But I would suggest that however you approach it that she first learns the process explicitly with one person and that once it is learnt that it is slowly generalised out to other people or prompts or environments otherwise she could easily lose the skill again.
Is there any reason to suspect her medications (if any), could be behind this?
Does she have sensory issues?  Could she becoming too stimulated or too focused on something that she doesn't recognise the need for the toilet?

1060,intentional urinating,"
        I would also add that any approach has to be flexible and yet consistent.  If the school is being totally unflexible then they are exhibiting autistic behaviour themselves!  There has to be a starting point.  What evidence is there that total removal of diapers will cause this student to learn sooner?

1061,autism/hypothyroid,"
        First and foremost, neonatal hypothyroidism is a serious condition and requires medical treatment.  If your son is currently under the care of your pediatrician or another physician for this condition then that is the most important thing here.  Thyroid replacement therapy is reported to be very effective.  Though hypothyroidism is treatable, it can lead to significant developmental impairment and other problems.  Low muscle tone is often reported though I am unaware of stereotypic behavior, like handflapping, being especially pronounced with this condition.  Nonetheless, stereotypy occurs with all children and adults at some level.  Children with autism tend to have more pronounced stereotypic behavior that persists and possibly becomes much more frequent as the child ages.  The typical approach to treating stereotypic behavior involves redirecting the child to other activities or teaching them to engage in more functional behavior like playing age-appropriate activities.  This is not always very easy to do and there are many situations in which these approaches could make the problem worse.  A Board Certified Behavior Analyst (or BCBA) is the most qualified person to assess handflapping and design proper intervention.  If you are interested in finding a BCBA in your area log onto www.bacb.com website and click on ""Consumer Information"" and then search the certificant registry for a professional in your area.  Given the concern of autistic-like behavior then it is probably also a good idea to have your son's development assessed.  For this I would suggest starting with a conversation with your pediatrician that you are concerned that your son may have autism and ask if s/he could recommend a qualified person to conduct developmental screening.  Your pediatrician should have access to a screening tool called the M-CHAT.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians use this with all children who are suspected to have problems with development.

1062,sister of asperger brother has focusing problems. 9 years old,"
        It is quite possible she has traits of ADD/ADHD or even Aspergers herself.  Does she have any sensory issues?  Are you sure she is defiant and does not respect authority.  Could it be that she is unaware that her behaviour is disrespectful and that she cannot predict outcomes?  Could her defiance be a need for her to stick to doing things her way?  If so these are more traits of Aspergers.
If her attention is drifting away and she becomes unaware of what is being said in class, this could be down to ADD or could be a focus/attention thing linked to sensory/autistic traits.  I am not on the spectrum, but I do have sensory issues and I too frequently become unaware of my surroundings ie. my husband may have to shout my name a number of times before I hear him speaking to me.
There are other disorders such as Oppositional Defiance Disorder - but she doesn't sound severe enough for that.
Are her social skills with peers okay?  Does she have any difficulty following instructions or planning or organising herself?  If so this could be down to Executive Function Disorder.
The fact that you say she does better in one to one situations seems to suggest she has difficulties in whole class environments.  Again it maybe traits of ADD or Aspergers.  
As you already know, having a quick temper or throwing tantrums is typical of autistic spectrum disorders and also impulsiveness can be part of ADD/ADHD which can lead to them quickly losing their temper.

1063,3 1/2 yr old wont bath,"
        I like your idea to try to distract your son during the bath. this was a good starting point. I recommend the following general strategy:
(1) Begin by bathing your son in a situation in which he does not scream or resist strongly. Pick a situation in which he is calm and will allow you to bathe him, but one which is as close to the ultimate bath goal as possible. For example, if he does fine when you wash him outside of the tub, start there. If your son will only tolerate very brief periods of washing, you could accomplish the entire bath across several brief periods of bathing in which you wash a different part of his body each time. This would also allow him to practice several times a day.
(2) Wash your son in this manner for several days. Give him lots of praise for cooperation and perhaps a desirable reward as long as he is cooperative
(3) Then gradually reintroduce components of the bath. Think about introducing one new component every few days, as long as your son is doing well. Start with those that you think will be least problematic. You will need to go very slowly. If he begins to resist the bath, you have changed things too quickly and will need to go back to a step on which he cooperates.
(4) In addition, consider adding some more fun to the bath time. You can provide some commerically available bath toys or allow your son access to some favorite toys that will not be ruined by water. Let him do some parts of the bath himself if he prefers. Give him some choices. For example, ask him which body part to wash first. Make sure that the bathroom is warm and that the water is at a comfortable temeperature.
(5) If your son resists the bath, try to follow through (if safe) by continuing the bath quickly and in a matter of fact manner. 
(6) Try to avoid commenting about or reacting to his protests about the bath, but do recongize his cooperation.

1064,3 1/2 yr old wont bath,"
        My son is suspected of Asperger's and we're going through the diagnosis right now so different from your son. However he has the sensory issues and this was one of them when he was that age. 
Here's what I did:
Daily I used to let him play naked with his favourite toy (animals) in an empty bath. Then after a few weeks we let the water trickle in. Eventually he would have a bath if he went in naked first, empty with the water then turned on slowly. He was then screaming if the water ran too fast or if I showered him so once he was comfortable in the bath daily for a few weeks I would run a shower into it for a short time, extending the period and eventually filling up the bath that way instead of with the taps. The water from the shower falling on the bath water fascinated him and he was calm.

It took me well over a year but it paid off. He is now 8 and will have a bath although he is anxious before he gets in and often climbs in before I run the tap. He now has a shower every morning and he doesn't actually wash but the water just hits his back and it's on the trickle setting not a power shower, he can't do it any other way.

I'm hoping that by the time he is a teen he will be able to wash properly but what was a distressing time for him and for me is now part of his routine and push him a tiny bit further every now and then, today it was shower gel. I found that he couldn't use a wash cloth but my hand instead, probably less irritating.

My son could communicate although not when he was this distressed but I know you have a more difficult task at hand. I hope this helps, hang in there.

1065,Truth Telling,"
        It is possible that your son reports when he has done something wrong because he is a bit less sensitive to the social responses that typically come along with those reports. It is hard to know. On a positive note, it is so important for parents and children to maintain the type of relationship that allows children to report accurately on their experiences. So, I would continue to enourage your son to be truthful.

1066,Truth Telling,"
        Those on the spectrum think in a very literal black and white way.  If he does something he knows is naughty he will feel bad about it because he knows it was wrong.  He may also feel guilty if he is impulsive because he couldn't control himself or stop himself doing something he knew he shouldn't.  He may then obsess about what he has done and he may also literally believe that 'we have to tell the truth'.  He won't understand about white lies, or not telling so you don't get into trouble.  He will believe that once he has done wrong he needs to tell someone to pass over the responsibility and let go of the guilt.  Is he telling about things he has been naughty or impulsive about, or is he telling about other things as well.  My son went through a phase that even when his sister had been naught, if she had to go to timeout he wanted to go to time out too because 'something naughty had happened'.  It took him a long time to understand that time out was only for the person who did the naughty thing.
The fact that he knows when he has done something he shouldn't is very positive because it shows a high level of self awareness.  However you need to keep an eye on this because he will understand he is different and that he has difficulties and that could lead to low self esteem and even depression.  Try to get him involved in any clubs or activities that is around his interests or obsessions to keep him occupied and motivated. You may also need to explain to your son that 'everyone does things wrong sometimes'.  You may also need to explain to him that some people tell lies etc.  If he believes everything that is said to him he maybe gullable and his peers may get him to do things that get him into trouble at school.
He may also have difficulties letting go of feelings.  If my son gets upset he says he cannot control the emotions or stop them.  So he can be upset, angry for long periods of time.  Even when he has recovered, if he remembers what happened, he will again become upset or angry.  At school they will need to work on emotions so that he recognises these emotions in himself and in others and he will need to be taught how to cope with emotions.  All these things will need to be taught explicitly because they wont come naturally to him.

        A diagnosis of autism is given based on significant deficits in language and social development and the presence of restrictive/repetitive patterns of behavior.

        Your doctor should be able to refer you to a multi disciplinary team that specialises in autistic spectrum disorders such as autism/aspergers etc.  They should be able to assess you and give you some insight into your condition.  You really need help to find out what your strengths and weaknesses are.  Do you have difficulties with social interaction for example?
As you mention colour linking into number associations etc it might be worth you googling synesthia to see if that sounds like what is happening to you.  This is when sensory information can get mixed up and associated with other senses.  For example you talk about numbers being related to colours.  Other people might have colours that relate to smells.  It might be that you have synesthesia and some autistic traits, but not enough for a diagnosis.

             For that doctor to blab autism off with no testing or other information besides your self report was off target!  He should to his homework first.  Autistic children take normal input and reinterpret into some personal meaning most of us cannot understand.  What was your history in school like?  Can you carry on a conversation and respond appropriately?  Are you able to take care of yourself? Do you have any friends or family who could substatiate anything the doctor said?  What is your family history?
     I was trying to figure out what my 11-year old son was thinking.  He thinks in 3D, able to dissect vehicles and buildings from top, bottom, and side views.  I read a book, THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA by Ronald Davis.  It explains much of this way of thinking, including seeing colors.  Dyslexia is not just having trouble reading, rather it is a whole different way of percieving things.  Some artists report that they see colors that they cannot replicate in their paintings.  Who cares if you see colors mixed in with numbers, as long as the math makes sense!  When I told my husband what I was reading in Ron Davis' book, he said, ""What? You can't see in 3D?""  It never occurred to him that others couldn't see what he saw.  The doctor cannot imagine anyone thinking 3D because he doesn't see that way.

        Masturbation is not uncommon in individuals diagnosed with autism at your son’s age, so what you are experiencing is not atypical.  For individuals with autism-spectrum diagnoses who are less sensitive to social contingencies, public masturbation is not an uncommon problem and these individuals can often be taught where and when it is and is not appropriate to masturbate.  I recommend that you contact a behavior analyst who has experience developing programs designed to do this (http://www.bacb.com/).  These interventions might involve your son earning a particular reward each day (or perhaps each hour) that he does not touch himself in school.  This might be combined with teaching him an appropriate place for masturbation (e.g., the bathroom at home) and what places are inappropriate (e.g., in public, at school, etc…).  Interventions of this sort can be quite effective in the absence of medication but, again, I recommend that you meet with a behavior analyst and discuss interventions that would work for you and your family.

        Is your son verbal?  If so, ask him does it hurt down there.  My son, and many other autistic children, do not volunteer information even when they are in pain.  You need to ask the specific question 'is it hurting you' and then he might reply 'yes'.  I have many examples of this, but the most recent was when one side of my sons face swelled up and I took him to the doctors.  He had a bad ear infection.  When I asked my son 'does your ear hurt you', he said 'yes I can't get to sleep at night'.  But he must have had that infection for a long time and hadn't uttered a word about being in pain to anyone.

        Many children seem motivated to hide their bowel movements, which makes toilet training difficult. Here are a few things that you could try:

(1) Try putting a potty seat in his bedroom so that he can use it privately and at the time he is used to going. Sometimes children feel more comfortable sitting on a potty seat than a large toilet.
(2) Try to minimize any negative interactions associated with bowel movements. Strong negative reactions may increase hiding.
(3) Encourage your son to sit on the potty seat just before bed. Allow him to get comfortable (e.g., take off clothes, look at a book).
(4) Arrange a very desirable reward for bowel movements on the potty seat.
(5) If your son resists sitting on the potty, you might need to work on this first. Encourage him to sit on the potty and give him a reward even if he doesn't go.

I would be concerned about using diaper pins. If he does get these open he could injure himself.

Good luck.

1085,4 year old pooping on floor,"
        It must be very frustrating, but this type of problem is very common - if that helps!!!
As he seems to have a routine of going before bedtime, could you work with that and get him on a potty he is comfortable with.  My son hated being looked at, so maybe if you stayed in the room with your back to him?
Does he have difficulties keeping his clothes, shoes or socks on?  If he does then he maybe tactile sensitive and certain types of sensation/fabrics may irritate and hurt him hence the continual removal of the offending item.  I am over sensitive to touch (but am not autistic), and I have a 7 year old son on the spectrum.  I cannot bear anything next to my skin apart from cotton.  No manmade fibres, and definately no wool or lace.  Tags also  have to be removed.  If I don't remove a tag it initially irriates, but after about 1 minute the sensation has turned to a stabbing pain (like being pricked by a thorn).  
I just mention these things incase there is a sensory explanation behind it.
Do you think your son can actually feel when he needs to go to the toilet?  Some people with autism find it hard to recognise internal sensations like this.  If he can recognise it, then would it be possible to teach him to use the 'toilet' PECS symbol to show you when he needs the toilet, so that you are ready for it?  Although my son is verbal he has some PECS symbols clipped onto his trousers with something that looks like a plastic coil spring.  If he cannot 'say' what he needs or wants, he can go to an adult and show them the picture.
If he really doesn't like to 'sit' on the potty, there are some inflatable toilet seats you can buy.  Or you could teach him to crouch over the potty, but not sit on it.
Is your son verbal?  Can you explain things to him and he understands?  If so you could show him why we use the toilet and what happens to the poop afterwards.  I know these types of videos are available, but I don't know where you get them from.  Some children find it useful to visually see the whole process before they know what they need to do.

1086,Is my 3 yr old autistic,"
        I am not a professional, but a parent of a 7 year old on the autistic spectrum.  
To get a diagnosis of being on the spectrum the child has to have difficulties in three areas (usually referred to as the Triad of Impairments) and has to have enough characteristics in each section.  If you google DSM IV for autism it will list the things professionals are looking for.  Therefore, each child is different and will show different aspects of autism.  
Can you give an example of what your son did that the therapist thought contradicted a diagnosis of autism?
Does your son play with children his same age?
Does he have any sensory issues eg. over or undersensitive to light, sound, touch, taste, texture, smell, balance or co-ordination?

        If you and your developmental pediatrician have concerns about your child's development it is important that you have him assessed. If your son is diagnosed with autism, you will be able to begin identifying appropriate early intervention. If your son is not diagnosed, your concerns about his development will be eased. I recommend to all parents that they seek an in-person assessment by a qualified professional whenever there are developmental concerns. It is so important to intervene early.

1088,Spinning wheels/circles,"
        Playing with parts of toys and especially spinning wheels etc is characteristic of being on the autistic spectrum, but obviously there is alot more to a diagnosis than that.  Also many children on the spectrum want and try to be social but don't really know how to do it as they either lack the language or social skills to be successful.  Some autistic children like alot of noise and visual distractions which can appear as if they like to socialise, when it is really the sensory stimulos of the social environment that they enjoy.
If you have concerns, the only way to address that is for your son to be assessed.  If he is on the autistic spectrum the earlier interventions begin the better the prognosis.

1089,Hand flapping,"
        Typically developing children do sometimes show repetitive behaviors that are typical of autism (e.g, hand flapping, body rocking). But, in addition to repetitive behavior, an autism diagnosis is based on delays in language and social development. If there are concerns in these areas, your grandson should probably be evaluated again.

If the only concern is his hand flapping, one could certainly work with him on reducing this behavior. I recommend gently interrupting the flapping as soon as it begins. Also, consider the situations is which he is flapping. If he is flapping when excited, work with him on more socially appropriate ways of showing excitement.

1090,Hand flapping,"
        For a child to be on the autistic spectrum they have to have enough characteristics in each area to get a diagnosis.  So a child would be observed and assessed by professionals such as a Speech and Language Therapist, Educational/Clinical Psychologist, Occupational Therapist, Clinical Paediatrician etc.
The areas of difficulty (usually called the triad of impairments), is (a) speech (any language delays or disorders), (b) social interaction (problems with interacting with peers, appears to not know how to play or join in), and (c) rigid repeitive behaviours, lack of imagination, need for routines etc (this can show itself in demanding things are always done in the same way, throwing tantrums at changes in routine, not appearing to have flexibility of thought etc).
If your grandson has these types of difficulties then please post again.  If he doesn't it is possible to have some traits of autism, but not enough to get a full diagnosis.
The part of your post I recognise as 'possible' (ie. I notice in my own son), is the detail orientated and the need for things to happen as he wants them to.  
What is his interaction like with his peers?
Does he have any sensory issues eg. appears over or under sensitive.  For example a child might cover their ears at certain noise and then appear deaf when someone calls their name.  Does he complain that soft touch hurts him and then appears not to feel pain if he hurts himself.  Is he sensitive to smells, tastes, textures of food.  Can he wear clothes with tags in?
Is it just the flapping that is concerning you?
Do you feel that his need to adhere to 'his plans' cause difficulties with family arrangements or playing with his peers?

        Thanks so much for your comments. At one time he didn't interact as well as I would like but now seems to do well. During Christmas h really enjoyed playing with his 6 year old cousin for several days. When she left he announced, ""I'm very sad because Lindsey had to leave."" That made me feel a lot better. He does seem to be a bit sensative but I think the main thing that worries me is the hand flapping and I didn't know if children that didn't have a problem of some sort do this. They are going to be going to Germany for 2 years and I really wanted to be sure he was OK or had what he needs before they go.

        Sertraline (brand name Zoloft) is a type of an antidepressant known as a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor.  It is sometimes prescribed to treat anxiety disorders and it sounds like this is the reason that your son is on the medication.    From your description, it seems that the medication is not having satisfactory effects on your child’s behavior.  The best recommendation that I can give you is to be in frequent contact with the psychiatrist, make sure that he or she is aware of the behavior problems that you’re seeing, that the plan for the medication and monitoring its effects is acceptable to you, and that you are comfortable with the decisions being made.  If this isn’t the case with your current psychiatrist, by all means see another.  Your pediatrician or other parents might be able to suggest someone local for you to try.

        Typically developing children can also display some of the repetitive behavior that is displayed by children with autism and aspergers. If you do not have any other concerns about your son's skills or behavior, I would not be particularly concerned about the hand flapping. I am glad that you shared your concern with your pediatrician, and it is important to continue to share any and all conerns as your son continues to develop.

Given that hand flapping will make your son stand out in some social situations, it is appropriate for you to make your son aware of this behavior and to encourage an alternative way for him to show excitement or to relieve boredome (whichever applies to the situation in which the handflapping occurs).

1095,Asperger's Flapping,"
        I am not a professional, I am a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum.  My son hardly flaps at all.  It is only if he gets very excited for example watching a DVD and it is at the most exciting part of the film and then he might bounce up and down on the sofa and flap his hands.  Or he might do it if he got extremely frustrated.  So flapping is not a big issue with my son eventhough he is on the spectrum.  He used to spin when he was a toddler and he still regulates his sensory system by using movement.
Have you looked at the DSM IV criteria for aspergers/autistic spectrum disorders?
To get a diagnosis your child has to get a certain level of the characteristics out of each section.  You may find your son doesn't have enough of them or in all sections to get a diagnosis.
But if you look at the DSM IV criteria you will see that they fall in sections eg. speech and communication, social interaction, imagination/rigid routines/obsessions etc.  Are you happy that your son does not have any difficulties in these areas?  Sometimes it is hard to see the difficulties, especially at that age.  For example my son also likes to play with other children, but as he has grown (he is now 7+), it became clear that although he wanted to play he found it difficult to join in imaginary games or to alter his role within a game.  He tends to want to play rigidly usually relating to things he has seen on TV (and all children do that to some extent).  So I was told that although he does want to play his social interaction is compromised because of his 'quality' of play. 
You have posted about the hand flapping.  My understanding is that this is mainly a sensory issue.  Does your son have any other sensory behaviour eg. what is his response to sound, touch, taste, smell, visual stimulus?  Also what is his balance and co-ordination like.  Does he ever fluctuate with perception eg. appear deaf sometimes and then complain of noise or cover his ears at other times.  Is he fussy about clothes/shoes/socks and having tags removed and yet at other times appears not to feel pain?  Does he complain about tastes/textures of food or about smells?
You don't mention having tantrums, especially around change of routine or expectations, so I presume that isn't a problem.  Is he okay with transitions eg. having to stop doing something to move onto something else, or would he get upset and insist that he finishes what he is doing?
Have a look at Sensory Integration Disorder and see if that sounds relevant?
But the only way to know for sure is for your son to be assessed by a multi disciplinary team that has experience of autism and aspergers.  This will involve them talking with you, his nursery, and also observing him to see his behaviours and also assessing him to see what his abilities are.  This usually involves a Speech and Language Therapist to assess receptive and expressive language as well as semantics/pragmatics of language, a Clinical Psychologist, Clinical Paediatrician and maybe a Neurologist and Occupational Therapist.  These assessments can take some time from a referal point of view and then assessments are carried out over a period of time.  From the age of 3 I began to have concerns with my son, and when he started school they called me in because of the avoidance behaviours he was showing.  The assessment process started when he was 4+ years old and it is only now at 7+ years old that he is in the right educational environment (still mainstream), and professionals are BEGINNING to put programmes of therapy into place.  So that took 3+ years!  So, if you do have any real concerns I would say start the process of assessments, because if he isn't on the spectrum he won't get a diagnosis, but if he is on the spectrum you need those supports and therapies in place asap.

1096,Asperger's Flapping,"
        Hello there,

Thank you very much for taking time to answer my concern. The time you took to write the response made me learn a few important things.

My son has no rigid habits, he is creative and interacts very well with other kids. He has very good imagination e.g. he will make his own games and give them names and makes his own rules which last a few moments and then he changes them........and so on. He has extremely well eye-hand coordination because I have playing catch with him since he was two year old.

Very rarely he has a tanturm. He is not fussy about anything in particular. He expresses himself very well, verbally and physically. We are 100% vegetarian but still he very strong physically because my wife or me (mostly her) take him to a park for extensive physical play everyday. He like creative and literary works and even geeky (if that is a word) stuff like me. Overall he has very rounded personality.

We are training him to ""Breath Deep"" whenever he feels like flapping his hands and he seems to start to responde to that very well because he seems to do it by himself also now. This is a meditation technique that I know works on people of any age to calm down emotions because it lowers heart rate and relaxes mussles.

Hence, after doing a lot of research and reading, I don't think he is in any kind of danger. Only thing left for me to do now is to talk to his preschool teacher about his flapping. Otherwise his teacher says that he is an extremely good boy.

Anyhow, thank you very much for taking time to write an answer to my question. May God bless you and all the parents.

        The breathing technique is a good one.  It sounds like he is just getting over excited and you are right to be thinking about and showing him ways to calm himself down.  And whilst he is doing those calming techniques he isn't flapping.  But I was just thinking about 'flapping' in general recently, and it must be relatively common because in the UK we have sayings like 'getting into a right flap' etc, so I do think that to some extent we all do it.

1098,when is this a concern,"
        if your child is on the spectrum then his way of playing will usually involve re-enacting things he has seen on video games, TV or DVDs.  I am not saying that he has no imagination, as some on the spectrum do have some imagination.  But most children, including my own son, are re-enacting the words, moves, storyline they have already heard.  He may begin to be able to use his imagination to alter the storylines or it may be a literal re-run of what he has experienced.  Would he let you join in with him?  If so you could use it to improve his social interaction skills.  You may find that he tries to control what you say and do so that you too playout what he has already seen or heard, but he may allow you to make some changes which is a positive thing.  
You could try to introduce some new games or new areas of play so that his play is not so rigid or repetitive.  But my own son can spend hours re-running DVDs in his head and saying the dialogue and acting out the various roles.  With limited imagination that is the only way they can 'play'.  At school you may find it helpful if school allows your son to choose what he will do at playtime (out of the choice of two things), and with whom he will do that (out of a choice of two classmates who have already agreed to play with your son).  Of course that will depend on his abilities, but with that kind of support my son has slowly been able to broaden his play activities and improve his social interaction with other children in his class.  But it needs to be highly structured, and must be observed and overseen by a teaching assistant to make sure all goes well.
I know it can be a bit disturbing to see them play so rigidly, but it is a good sign that he wants to play.  You can use this as a motivator to improve his social play skills if his school has the experience and expertise to use this.

I have tried to explain to his family about our son's odd behavior and all they say is he all right your just looking for problems but i'm not. I try really hard to set up play dates too but they always seem not to work cause of personality clashes he some times has with kids his own age they just dont seem to understand where he is coming from , and i have to explain it.

but I also hear this alot to he is an only child and that is why he acts the way he does but i know other only kids and they dont act this way and i work really hard to keep involed in actives, I'm always finding events to take him to meet other kids, he is involed at his church he goes wed. and sun. they just make me feel that i dont try hard enough but i know i do. sorry dont mean to vent.
I always have to keep him happy it seems just the smallest things upset him like today I took him to his asthma doc. cause he had a bad cough and the doc told him that he had a virus and he started to cry and the list can go on , i always feel like a cheerleader lol

        If he is on the spectrum, the trick, if you can manage it is to expand through his interests.  I don't know about Zelda, but if you can use his interest in that game to expand his interest and knowledge through extending the boundaries of Zelda.  For example, my son likes knights and soldier fighting games.  So I bought him those dressing up clothes, and when kids come round he can play knights or solidier games with them.  This has led to an interest in martial arts and he is to begin going to a club to learn how to fight like the professionals do.  So, look at Zelda and see how you can extend that into other areas of interest.  That way you are using his interest in Zelda to motivate him.  If you just try to get him involved in something totally unrelated he won't be interested/focused/or motivated to do it.
Also, some may recommend limiting the time they spend on their obsessions.  I don't, because it then means you are limiting the one thing they like and are good at.  Try to extend from it if you can.

1102,Autism and Asberges in the family,"
        Google DSM IV and look at the diagnostic criteria for Aspergers.  You have to have difficulties in all the areas mentioned to get a diagnosis.
I would also consider whether a formal diagnosis will be a positive thing for you.  Try to find out if it will affect your insurance premiums etc, or it may give you access to certain benefits you don't currently qualify for.
As well as difficulties with social interaction those on the spectrum usually have difficulties with language and may take things very literally and not understand certain types of humour such as sarcasm.  With Aspergers there is also usually interests and obsessions that are not usually typical.  There is also alot of anxiety as well as difficulties with 'theory of mind' and imagination or predicting outcomes etc.
As you are interested and willing to improve your social skills there is every chance that you will be successful.  But that may mean that you have to rote learn a mental list/procedure to go through to try to help you at times when things are not obvious to you.  
If you think a diagnosis would be useful to you, then you could talk with the professionals involved with your children and tell them you think that you too may be on the spectrum and would like to be assessed and ask them how you would go about it in your area.  
It maybe that you have some traits, but not enough to get a formal diagnosis.  I have some sensory issues, auditory processing problems and tend to be quite solitary - although I can enjoy myself in large social settings if I'm in the mood for it.  I think it is quite common for traits of autism/aspergers to be in family members when there is a child with a full diagnosis.
But, although you may struggle with some things, you are in an ideal position to understand how your children are perceiving things and what kinds of supports would be helpful.  
I think it is brilliant that more and more adults on the spectrum are beginning to work in schools/adult employment to help others understand what is behind the difficulties.  And as well as causing you some difficulties, autism/aspergers also has some very positive aspects to it eg. total concentration and endurance in areas of interest, original approaches to problem solving etc.  
If you don't think a formal diagnosis would be helpful, it might still be useful when seeking help or advice about your anxiety/panic attacks to mention that you have children on the spectrum and think you might have aspects of it as well.  That should help professionals give you a more suitable approach to helping you with your difficulties as the basis of them may be completely different from other people who are not on the spectrum.

        The only way that your son will get a diagnosis is if he is assessed and observed by a multi disciplinary team who have experience and expertise in diagnosing autism and aspergers.  You should go to your doctor and request he refers you to the relevant professionals or clinic.  Your son will need to have enough characteristics out of each section for him to get a diagnosis.  Google DSM IV for Aspergers and see what the criteria is.  However, as you mention you cannot understand what he is saying, that sounds more like autism as those with Aspergers have normal language development - so google DSM IV for autism as well.
I don't think the things you mention are down to behaviour because you say he is uncoordinated, and that he seems unable to follow simple verbal instructions and that you cannot understand what he is saying to you.  They all indicate a problem, not behaviour, although frustration at not being able to communicate or get his needs met may lead to frustration and behavioural issues.
He needs to be assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist for his language and social interaction skills and an Occupational Therapist to assess his balance/coordination and other sensory functions.
When you see the doctor also mention that he doesn't seem interested in interacting with his peers, that you cannot understand what he is saying to you and that he cannot tolerate changes to his routine and say that you suspect he maybe on the autistic spectrum.
You need to start this process because if you cannot understand him and he is 4, he is going to have alot of difficulties when he starts school, and everyone needs to know what his strengths and weaknesses are prior to school so that supports are in place by then.

        It sounds as though your primary concern relates to your son and his relationship with the boy you describe. This seems like the best focus, given that your son's friend's parents, teachers, and pediatrician are apparently not concerned about his development. Here are a few thoughts:

(1) To me, it is great that your son has a variety of interests and the ability to get along with lots of different kids.
(2) I would not be concerned about your son playing video games and playing inside sometimes, as long as he also has other interests. He sounds like a well-balanced kid. If you see that he is beginning to spend too much time on any one activity, you might considering expanding his experiences by providing him with other opportunities (e.g., inviting some different friends over, signing up for a sport).
(3) If your son spends a great deal of time with this child, he must enjoy his company. It may be helpful to talk to your son about what he likes about spending time with this child.
(4) You could consider encouraging the two children to do some different activities when they are together. Perhaps your son could give you some ideas.

        I am not an expert, but......
I would certainly be worried about only one thing - teachers that are saying that your son is trying to break away from him. 

Your son made a choice to be this boy's friend - probably he sees that he is left behind....

Unless you see any regression in your son - let them be friends. 

Provide some interaction opportunities - other than video games - offer them activities. Try to play sports with them. 

I always made friends with unpopular children - I felt bad about them being bullied by ""popular children""........I helped them to study and socialize, as I was fairly popular and straight ""A"" student, but the person who got the most of these relationships is me.

Try to talk to your son for starters - it maybe that he is introverted by nature and does not mix well with all the jocks.

        As you may know, autism is characterized by language and social impairment and by restricted/repetitive behavior patterns. You mention some concerns about language, but there do not appear to be social concerns, and the only repetitive behavior that you mentioned is repeating words.

Of course, diagnosis requires a thorough, in-person assessment. I would certainly encourage the family to seek an assessment if they are at all concerned.

I would not be concerned about offering multiple forms of communication (e.g., sign, spanish). The data on infant signing, for example, indicate that signing does not intefere with development of vocal language.

        I think the only way to find out for sure is to have him assessed by a speech and language therapist.  I think that hearing different languages can sometimes make them later to start talking (but having said that my daughter was bi-lingual from 9 months onwards).  My son was only saying 2 word combinations at 2+ years and he began repeating words and phrases he heard people say or from the TV.  He went on to get a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder.  I am not suggesting that that is definately what it is, but you have your concerns, and if this boy is on the spectrum then the sooner he receives input from professionals the better the outcome.
I would also like to point out that being on the autistic spectrum does not mean a child cannot hug, kiss or show affection.  Those on the milder end are able to do this to varying degress (along with show imagination and have some theory of mind), although they may have other social interaction difficulties.

        Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder in which tumors grow along the nerves.  There have been reports of individuals with this condition also being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.  Somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% of children with this condition also have developmental/learning problems.  If you are particularly interested in determining whether your son also has an autism spectrum disorder than a qualified profressional who can administer a test such as the ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) can provide this service for you.  In some cases having this diagnosis may make more resources available to you.  Some of the behaviors you describe (persistent interests in trains/WWII, hand flapping, social awkwardness) also occur frequently in persons with autism.  The feeding issue you mention sounds like the problem you are most immediately concerned about.  A diagnosis of an ASD will not change the nature of how you should approach this feeding problem.  Food selectivity is common in people with autism/developmental disabilities and typically developing persons.  The primary function of eating is weight gain and growth.  If you son is gaining weight and growing as he should (that is, he is around the same growth percentile on his weight/growth curves now as he was when he was younger - your pediatrician should be able to help you assess this) then the problem may be challenging but not a severe issue.  If he is not gaining weight and growing as he should then the first thing you should be considered about is getting him to eat more.  Variability in food intake is certainly desirable but is often a difficult challenge.  There are several books and book chapters that have sound suggestions about things to try.  I'll paste some of these in below.  Additionally, there are feeding services associated with most pediatric hospitals that can likely provide an interdisicplinary assessment of his eating.  You state that an OT is working with your son on his feeding and not making progress.  Making progress on eating requires someone with expertise in feeding and many disciplines treat feeding problems.  When motor skills or posture interfere with eating and OT can be invaluable.  It might be the case that your son needs behavioral programming to make progress.  It is possible that a feeding specialist with behavior analytic training could be of assistance.  One suggestion I have is to search for BCBAs (Board Certified Behavior Analysts) near you by going on to http://www.bacb.com/ and searching the certificant registry under ""Consumer Information.""  You should be able to locate the nearest BCBA and ask them if they have experience with feeding problems and if they do not whether they know anyone in the area who does.  Most selective eaters can make progress but progress may be very slow, especially since your son has been a selective eater for so long.  I suggest picking up a book on feeding problems and do the things I mention above. The first book I list is very comprehensive and the second is a book chapter I wrote that covers feeding problems in kids with autism. Best of luck!

Treating Eating Problems of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and Developmental Disabilities
(12234) ISBN: 9781416402480 

Our Price: $49.00 
Interventions for Professionals and Parents 

A child’s incessant screaming, spitting, and food throwing during mealtime are enough to frustrate any parent or caregiver! Continuous resistance to eating not only leads to malnourishment, but physical and intellectual developmental become additional concerns. Invariably, the underlying reason(s) for refusing to eat will differ from child to child, so the focus should be on improving or resolving the eating problem.

This is a two-part book written for caregivers and professionals who work with children with feeding problems. It presents behavioral interventions and approaches on solving a child’s resistance to eating. 

Part One was specifically written for teachers, parents, and caregivers with no prior professional experience or training on feeding problems. 
Part Two was written for professionals, providing detailed information on how to apply behavioral assessment and developing individualized interventions based on a child’s eating behaviors. 
The behavioral interventions and procedures presented in this book can also be integrated into oral motor or dysphagia therapy. Includes references and brief descriptions.

Note: This book is not designed to treat sensitive eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.  Please consult professional assistance.

making a difference: Behavioral Intervention for autism
(9208) ISBN: 9780890798713 

Our Price: $43.00 

When Behavioral Intervention for Young Children with autism appeared in 1996, it quickly became an international bestseller in its field. Drawing from solid research and specific experiences, the researchers, parents, and practitioners who contributed to that book explained the principles of behavior analysis and applications to autism intervention, the critical distinctions between science and pseudo-science, and proven strategies for maximizing learning. 

Now PRO-ED introduces a follow-up volume, making a difference: Behavioral Intervention for autism. 

For this new book, the editors once more sought out practitioners, researchers, and parents who could provide readers with the kind of information they need to make informed decisions about the children and adults in their care. Included in the work are powerful statements from parents Pamela Dawson and Lora Perry, who describe the challenges they faced in obtaining effective treatment for their children and how they navigated those challenges. also included are chapters written by professionals who have dedicated their careers to finding creative and caring means of helping people with autism and their families. Dr. William ahearn discusses the management of feeding problems. Dr. Bridget Taylor and her colleague Suzanne Jasper lay out some techniques for improving social skills. Dr. Richard Foxx talks about the treatment of problem behaviors - what to do if an individual's progress is slow, or practitioners run into roadblocks. Edward Fenske and his co-authors, Drs. Krantz and McClannahan, discuss the critical role of incidental teaching procedures in promoting spontaneous language. Dr. Gregory MacDuff and his co-authors provide an overview of research on prompting and prompt-fading, and provide guidelines for using prompts to develop new, independent skills. Margery F. Rappaport, a speech-language pathologist, shares her experiences in maximizing conversational skills. Dr. Deborah Fein and her colleagues review what is currently known about the nature of autism. Dr. Catherine Maurice examines the political turmoil surrounding autism and the myriad treatments that are currently promoted for this disorder. 

making a difference, like its predecessor, combines solid, data-based information with practical problem-solving strategies. It will be a valuable resource for family members and professionals alike who strive to maximize the achievements of individuals with autism.

        I am a parent of a child (age 7-8) who has high functioning autism.  I am not a professional.  Your son does have some typical characteristics of Aspergers.
And he is having such difficulties with social interaction I can understand why you are homeschooling him.  However, social interaction is part of the Speech and Language Therapists responsibility.  She should be putting together a programme to improve his social skills because unfortunately he will not be able to remove himself from the world and he will need to interact with other people.
Please don't think i'm being judgemental, because I am not.  But when you are no longer around the professionals who will have contact with him will need to know exactly what his disorder is, otherwise they may think he is being awkward, or spoilt or rude, when infact it is Aspergers.  
My son also finds social interaction difficult.  He simply does not know what to do or say.  They have to be taught specific rote learnt phrases to help them initiate conversation, and they have to be taught to time themselves and stop talking after a number of minutes to let the other person speak.  They also have to be taught to listen to what the other person says!  And this is just one thing that we think is so simple, just having a chat with someone.  He has to learn everything.
My son is in a mainstream school, but it also has experience and expertise in autism.  He goes to dinner time clubs and is supported in his play by it being structured eg. he chooses what activitiy to do at play time and he choose who he will do it with and a Teaching Assistant keeps an eye on proceedings.  
I am going to an Educational Tribunal at the end of January 2009 to get the provision in school that my son needs.  I have had private reports from an Occupational Therapist, Speech and Language Therapist and Educational Psychologist.  Some of the things I have asked for have already been agreed.  My son will get a greater level of support that any other child in that school.  Unfortunately everything is down to budgets.  The more 'needs' your child has the more it costs the educational system.  However there are educational laws that state that your son's 'needs' must be met.
If I were homeschooling my son I would still want input from a Speech and Language Therapist about how to improve his social skills.
Regarding Sensory stuff.  I found a book by Olga Bogdashina called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers very useful.  She has a daughter with aspergers and a son with autism.  This book helped me reduce my sons sensory behaviour because it showed me 'what' he was experiencing.  There is a questionnaire at the back of the book that you can complete to get a sensory profile.  This questionnaire is reputable as the autism outreach department in my city uses it.  You may find that there are other senses also affected and that is causing additional stress on his sense of smell and taste/texture.  If those other senses are helped, then it may lesson the oversensitivity on the other senses.  Google Irlen Syndrome as alot of those on the autistic spectrum can have this visual perceptual problem.  My son wears the glasses for sensitivity to sunlight and depth perception.  It has helped reduce his auditory sensitivity.
Would your son consider tasting things on the promise that he doesn't have to swallow them?
Do you think it is the taste or the texture of the food that is the problem.
Does your son also have oversensitive smell?
If he is refusing food because it is a rigid way of thinking then you need to teach him the idea of 'change' or 'surprise'.  An Educational Psychologist/SALT should be able to show you how to do this.  This helps them realise that 'change' is not always bad.  They stick rigidly to things because their sensory world changes constantly and they cannot predict outcomes.  If noise hurts your ears one day, but not the next you will automatically begin to avoid noise 'incase' it hurts you.  And that way of thinking may apply to all his sensory systems.  It took my son a while to accept that 'chicken nuggets' are the same as 'chicken chunks' are the same as 'pieces of fried chicken with breadcrumbs'.  Prior to that he would tantrum if a word changed.  Now he is better - not perfect - but alot better with change. 
Regarding getting a diagnosis.  Is it going to be beneficial to your son or in getting the supports and provisions he needs?  If it will help then it might be worth getting it.
Regarding narrow interests.  That is how they are.  However you can teach them many things through their interests.  There is no point trying to make them interested insomething they aren't interested in.  They just won't have any attention or focus for it.  It might be an idea to try and extend his interests to make the box bigger.  For example if he likes trains you might get him interested in the cities that the trains visit, and then move it to cities around the world etc etc.

Researchers Identify Mechanism and Possible ************** for Growth of Nerve Tumors in Neurofibromatosis 

Researchers studying neurofibromatosis type 1 — a rare disease in which tumors grow within nerves — have found that the tumors are triggered by crosstalk between cells in the nerves and cells in the blood. The researchers, who were funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Defense (DOD), also found that a drug on the market for treating certain kinds of blood cancer curbs tumor growth in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1. A clinical trial of the drug is underway in people with the disease.

The results of the study on mice are published in the October 31, 2008 issue of Cell. 

The study's senior investigators were Luis F. Parada, Ph.D., a neuroscientist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, and D. Wade Clapp, M.D., a hematologist at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis. Their research was supported by NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), NIH's National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the Neurofibromatosis Research Program of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command.

""By taking a team approach and combining their unique areas of expertise, Drs. Parada and Clapp were able to shed light on a complicated disease mechanism and to develop a potential treatment,"" says Jane Fountain, Ph.D., a program director with NINDS.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disease that affects about 1 in 3500 Americans. The nerve-associated tumors, or neurofibromas, that occur in the disease tend to grow just under the skin or at the nerve root. The latter type of tumor, called a plexiform neurofibroma, can cause disabling symptoms by compressing the nerve, the spinal cord, bones, muscles and internal organs.

The tumor forming cells within a neurofibroma may become malignant and spread to other parts of the body. There is currently no treatment to prevent neurofibroma growth.

In 1990, NIH-funded investigators discovered that neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by loss-of-function mutations in a tumor suppressor gene, now known as NF1. People with the disease have the genetic makeup NF1+/-, meaning they have one functional copy of the gene and one non-functional or mutant copy.

Still, for many years the trigger for neurofibroma growth has been a mystery. Schwann cells, which form a protective sheath around nerve fibers, were a prime suspect. However, neurofibromas also contain nerve fibers themselves, connective tissue and mast cells, the latter of which circulate in the blood and contribute to inflammation.

Combined with previous findings, the new study suggests that the formation of plexiform neurofibromas requires two steps: complete loss of NF1 in Schwann cells (rendering them NF1 -/-) and an interaction between NF1 -/- Schwann cells and NF1+/- mast cells. While Schwann cells appear to be the primary tumor causing cell, mast cells appear to stimulate tumor growth by recruiting other cell types and blood vessels to the tumor.

""The mast cell inflammatory response appears to be co-opted by the tumor to enhance tumor growth,"" says Dr. Parada.

The researchers uncovered the role of mast cells in tumor growth through a series of technically challenging experiments. Previously, Dr. Parada had shown that mice with a targeted deletion of the NF1 gene in their Schwann cells and an NF1+/- genetic background develop plexiform neurofibromas, while mice with the same targeted deletion and an NF1+/+ genetic background do not develop the tumors. Drs. Parada and Clapp now show that in these non-tumorigenic mice, it is possible to induce plexiform neurofibromas by transplantation of NF1+/- bone marrow (which contains mast cells and other blood cells).

The researchers also examined the role of c-kit, a molecule that is expressed by mast cells and other cell types, and is known to become overactive in some kinds of cancer. When c-kit was genetically deleted in NF1+/- bone marrow cells prior to transplantation, the transplanted cells failed to induce neurofibromas. Meanwhile, in mice that were prone to develop neurofibromas, the cancer drug Gleevec — an inhibitor of c-kit — reduced the metabolic activity and size of the tumors.

Because Gleevec is already prescribed for chronic myelogenous leukemia and other cancers, the researchers were able to secure fast regulatory approval for a phase 2 clinical trial of the drug in children and adults with neurofibromatosis type 1.

In their report, the researchers also discuss the compassionate use of Gleevec in one young neurofibromatosis patient with an airway-compressing plexiform neurofibroma. This patient was not considered an ideal candidate for surgery given the location of the tumor and its vascular nature. A three month administration of the drug was effective in significantly shrinking the tumor without any observed side effects.

""The results in this one patient are encouraging, but future research is critical to determine any long-term benefits and risks in the majority of patients,"" Dr. Fountain says.

The researchers say that the complex origin of tumors in neurofibromatosis — which has thwarted therapeutic development until now — could be the chink in the disease's armor. In patients with leukemia, Gleevec directly targets the cancer-causing cells, which can become genetically resistant to the drug over time and render it ineffective.

""In patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, we are using the drug to target a non-tumorigenic cell, so we believe we are less likely to see drug resistance,"" Dr. Clapp says.

1112,High levels of Immunoglobulin E in a severe and non verbal autistic child,"
        Although some families report that eliminating allergens results in improvement in the characteristics of autism, data-based research does not support this observation. Certainly, if you son has food allergies, it will be important to address these under the care of qualified medical professionals. But, I also recommend that you focus on educational and behavioral interventions that have documented effectiveness in addressing the characteristics of autism.
    ",http://www.medhelp.org//posts/Autism--Aspergers-Syndrome/High-levels-of-Immunoglobulin-E-in-a-severe-and-non-verbal-autistic-child/show/713771,user_340688,1112
1113,High levels of Immunoglobulin E in a severe and non verbal autistic child,"
        If any child has allergies or food intolerances then removing them from the diet should make them feel better.  If you feel better you are more likely to cope with things that would normally upset you or overwhelm you.  Children with autism tend to communicate their feelings through behaviours rather than language, so it is obvious that their behaviours may improve if they feel better.  There is alot of debate about food intolerances.  
However, autism is not due to allergies or intolerances, although some parents do report some improvements with diet changes.  Many other parents, including myself, don't have improvements.  I do have food intolerances and I do have improvements when I remove those foods.
Autism is neurological.  That means it is part of 'who' they are.  It is how they are wired up.  It is chemical reactions (and we are all made up of chemical reactions).  
Children with autism can sometimes have very restricted diets, so removing something from their diet should really be checked with a nutricianist to make sure their diet is still balanced.
I found more improvement in my son's autistic behaviours by moving him to a school that had experience of teaching children on the autistic spectrum.  Addressing his sensory needs (google sensory integration disorder and also Olga Bogdashina and read an article by her in autism today).  Getting the right support in school by having a private Speech and Language Therapist assess all areas of his speech and social interaction so that school knew exactly what kind of supports would help him.  
There are lots of things that will help your son grow and develop.  And there are also alot of treatments out there that have no validation at all.  
So if you want to try it and see if there is an improvement okay.  Casein leaves the system quicker than glutein.  So it might be easier to remove diary foods first and if there is no noticeable improvement in a couple of months put him back onto diary.  Then a couple of months after that remove glutein.  I think you need much longer to see if glutein is having any affect.
Always make sure you go to reputable/qualified and registered doctors and professionals.

1114,Is this how it usually goes,"
        If your son's teachers have identified learning or behavioral difficulties, the school should be working with you to identify whether (and what type) of services he requires. Special Education laws vary a bit from state to state, so I recommend that you visit the website of your state Departement of Education to get information about the processes for assessment and special education. Most parents are eager to obtain an accurate diagnosis, which can help with obtaining services. But, it is important to recognize that appropriate educational and behavioral interventions are not typically specific to the diagnosis. So, work with your son's school and other professionals to identify appropriate intervention as soon as possible.

1115,Aspergers or autism ???,"
        Autism and Asperger’s Disorders are characterized by a similar set of characteristics, most notably deficits in social interaction skills, communication skills, and highly stereotyped behaviors (e.g., repetitive motor or vocal behaviors that don’t seem to serve any function) or interests (topics of conversation or activity are highly restricted or narrow).  The major difference among the disorders is in language development: in Asperger’s Disorder, there is no delay in early language development. In Autism, there is some delay in language acquisition.  Also, delays (in language or social development) must be noted to occur prior to age 3 for a diagnosis of Autism.

Other generalizations are often made about the different characteristics and interests of individuals diagnosed with these disorders, but those characteristics are not part of the diagnostic criteria for the disorders.

As always, a pediatrician or other health professional should see the individual in person to make an accurate diagnosis.

1116,Aspergers or autism ???,"
        Google DSM IV and look at the diagnostic criteria for autism and aspergers.  There isn't a huge amount of difference and it can be even harder to fit the diagnosis to a child/adult because there can be alot of borderline charteristics that fit both diagnosis.  But generally those with Aspergers tend to develop language normally.  However every parent I know with a child with a diagnosis of Aspergers says that they still have huge problems with language and social interaction.  They tend to have language processing problems, Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder, Literal interpretation of language etc.  Those with Aspergers tend (but not always), to do better ie average to above average academically.  They also tend to have obsessions and interests.
Those with autism tend to have much greater difficulty with language and tend not to develop language at the usual age.  They may not be verbal at all or may be delayed or have disordered speech.  My son is HFA and is verbal, but is also echolalic (again both those with autism and aspergers can be echolalic, which is an indication of their language difficulties because this demonstrates they don't learn language in the same way that we do.)  They also tend not to have obsessions in the same way or extent as those with aspergers.
Many would say that aspergers is on the autistic spectrum with severely autistic children being at one end and HFA and aspergers at the other.
Both groups have difficulties with change in general, changes in routine or expectations not being met.  Both groups of sensory difficulties.

1120,Could my son have Asperger's Syndrome?,"
        One of the main diagnostic features associated with Asperger’s Disorder is severe and continued impairment in social interaction. In addition, the disorder is characterized by restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and activities with no significant delays in language acquisition. Although some of the motor and social difficulties you noted are consistent with a diagnosis of Asperger’s Disorder, an accurate diagnosis can only be made through assessment by a qualified professional. Therefore, I recommend that you seek the assistance of an individual who specializes in the diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorders. Although diagnosis alone will not point to an appropriate intervention, it will lead you to identify appropriate services for your son. I also recommend that you seek the support of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, who would be able to conduct the appropriate assessments and to assist in developing a behavior plan. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers.

1121,Could my son have Asperger's Syndrome?,"
        From my experience, and speaking with other parents, I have come to the conclusion that once you have a diagnosis it is extremely difficult to get anyone interested in assessing for anything else.  They tend to use phrases like 'children with ADHD tend to have these types of difficulties'.  But, as you say, that doesn't help you or your son.  As you probably know already every child with any diagnosis is different.  No two children with ADHD will be the same, and neither are any two children with autism/aspergers.  It is very common for children to have traits of both (and other) disorders.
As he is sound sensitive I would suggest you google Sensory Integration Disorder.  This should be assessed by an Occupational Therapist.  They can then put together a sensory diet to help reduce sensitivities.  I sould a book by Olga Bogdashina called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers very useful because it also explained alot of the behaviours.  For example his 'appearing deaf' is probably not down to any hearing loss.  It is because when he is focused on something else his 'hearing' effectively shuts down.  Or as his hearing can be hypersensitive at times the only way he can control that is to block out all sound.  He may/maynot do that intentionally, and his ability to tolerate different sounds and quantities of different sound sources will vary throughout the day and day to day.  But hearing is just one of the senses.  The rest are sight, smell, taste, touch, balance and co-ordination.  They may all be affected.  The book I mentioned has a sensory profile questionnaire at the back which our autism outreach department uses to get a sensory profile of each child.  You can also google Olgas name and read articles by her printed in Autism Today.
If he has Sensory Integration Disorder, it might also be worth screening him for Irlen Syndrome.  This is a visual perceptual problem that many with autism and dyslexia have.  It is corrected just by wearing glasses with tinted lenses.  
Concepts such as team games will be difficult for him to grasp if he also has autistic traits.  My son cannot play football.  
You can also google Executive Function Disorder, to see if any of that sounds relevant.
My son also has difficulties with Auditory Processing Disorder and Auditory Memory.  A Speech and Language Therapist should assess for this as well as Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder.
The SALT and an EP can assess for Dyslexia.  He may need access to a special teacher using multi sensory learning to help with those concepts.
The OT should also access his hand writing skills as it may be a motor co-ordination problem or a motor planning problem.
I find it is always helpful to put my concerns in writing and to get written replies.  That is your evidence if you ever have to go to an educational tribunal about your son's education.
The reluctance to assess is also down to budgets.  If they assess and find that your son has other needs, then they have to provide the supports in school to meet those needs.  That costs money.  I would go to the doctor/paediatrician and tell them your concerns and ask that you want him to be assessed by a multi disciplinary team that have experience of diagnosing autism because of the reasons stated above.  I would also ask for him to be referred to Occupational Therapy because you suspect he has Sensory Integration Disorder.
When you know who will be assessing your child, write them a letter with your concerns and list all the above disorders that you want him assessed for that you think may be part of his difficulties.
If that fails, get a private report done.  There are laws (find out what they are in your State) about how the school is legally bound to meet the needs of children with special educational needs.
Please also remember that because there is unfortunately a limited amount of money, that the parents who push hardest tend to get the provision.

        I would suggest that you go try to identify a hospital in an urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children who present developmental delays. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations. You can then take these recommendations to your local school system

The most effective treatment for children with autism is early intensive behavioral intervention. This means that your son should receive 20 hours of direct teaching in language, social skills and self-help skills. Services can be provided by early intervention or the public schools in your area. You may want to look for behaviorally trained professionals to supervise a treatment program by checking www.bacb.com for a person in your area.

        You need to go to your doctor and ask for a referal to professionals that are experienced in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders including Aspergers.
The first professional to assess a child is usually the Speech and Language Therapist.  Your child does sound like they are having problems with language development.
He also sounds like he has sensory issues which maybe Sensory Integration Disorder.  This can affect any or all of the senses eg. vision, sound, touch, taste, smell, balance and co-ordination.  This maybe responsible for the difficulties you have mentioned of rocking constantly, tactile and auditory issues (covering his ears), bright lights, only eat dry foods etc etc.  
As he has these sensory difficulties it might also be worth googling Irlen Syndrome and seeing if that is relevant to your son.  It can be helped enormously just by wearing tinted lenses in glasses.  It is a recognised condition that affects a considerable amount of autistic and dyslexic children/adults.
An Occupational Therapist should assess for sensory difficulties and they should have experience of SID as well as autistim.  Your doctor should refer you to an OT.
Your child will also usually be seen by a clinical paediatrician and clinical psychologist.
You might also want to google Carl Delacato and Olga Bogdashina for more information about sensory differences and how they affect behaviour and perception.
Is his violence around changes in routines or expectations or with being expected to take turns or share things.  What is he like with transitions ie. having to turn off the TV or computer or being asked to do something.
You can also google DSM IV (this is the diagnostic criteria for autism/aspergers).  Look at the criteria for autism and aspergers, make notes about how it seems relevant to your son (do the same for Sensory Integratiion Disorder) and go and see your doctor again.

        He does freak out if there is any change in routine or if we take a different route home. We have not found any reason for the violence. Nothing seems to trigger it. Another child might be playing and he will walk up and hit them for no reason. The School Board has started the process for OT and Speech, but that will take months. In the mean time we are helpless.

        You don't say what country you are in, but here are some suggestions you can try.  Joining a parent support group in your area will give you alot of advice and support because they will have gone through what you are going through now.  It will give your family a chance to meet other families with children similar to your son.  In these groups their behaviour is understood by everyone and not judged.  In my area we hold a twice weekly group which we would in the gym of the local community college.  The children pay a fee to get in and they can also have siblings and friends along too.  They put out all the gym equipment, including a trampoline and bouncy castle and spend 2 hours letting off steam and playing together.  There are supervisors watching the children.  The parents go into the school staff room and have tea/biscuits etc.  It is a chance to chat and swop information.  Some parents take in laptops and get some work done!  It is just 2 hours off with other people in a similar situation.
As your son has sensory differences I would recommend buying a book by Olga Bogdashina called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  There is a caregivers questionnaire at the back of this book which you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.  You can complete that and give it to the OT when you see them.  This questionnaire is used by our autism outreach department, so I know it is reputable.
If the wait for OT is long (it took us 2 years!), then you can pay for a private OT to come and give you a programme to be getting on with.  If you decide to do this make sure you get one with experience of sensory integration as well as autism.
You say his speech is excellent.  But is he repeating words/phrases he has heard you say or has heard on TV/DVD/Films?
Do you think he understands what you say?
Does he ever give an unrelated answer to a question you ask him.
If it does turn out that he doesn't have any language difficulties (which will be unusual), it is still the speech and language therapists area to work on his social interaction and play skills.  He will need to be explicitly taught all these things.  
For example, my son wants to play and interact, but doesn't know how to do it (he is 7), so the SALT is going to start teaching him some phrases to say in certain situations to help get him started.  When he learns these phrases he can rely on them to get him going eg. 'what is your favourite TV programme'.  If he can ask a child that, that is a way of getting into a conversation.  But he has to learn these things, they will not come naturally.
Remember you are not helpless.  You are the ONLY people who will advocate for your child.  Make sure you always put things in writing (even if you have spoken on the phone follow it up with a letter).  Find out what your son's educational rights are and keep pushing until it happens.  Please don't wait for professionals to 'do the right thing'.  I know this sounds very cynical, but the fact is that everything runs on a budget and it is not in their interest to provide for all of your son's needs.  But there are laws, and when you find out what they should be doing and point it out to them, they have to respond.  Don't be afraid of getting private reports if you think it would help.  Make sure they are professionals that are independent (ie. not working for the State or Health Service) and that they are used to providing reports for Educational Courts.  I am going through this process in the UK and have just managed to get the Education Authority to agree to my son having speech and language therapy sessions from a therapist once a week and daily sessions with a teaching assistant.  No other child in his school gets that level of support.  But the private report I paid for proved that he needed that level of therapy.  I know we shouldn't have to do any of this.  Having a child on the spectrum is enough work!  But remember his future is in your hands.  Don't be afraid or feel guilty, just find out what you can do.  It has taken me years (from age 3 to 7) to get to the stage I am at now.  I am finally happy with his school and the support he will be getting.
As he is at nursery age, have a look round at nurserys and schools that have experience of teaching children on the autistic spectrum.  I cannot emphasis how important it is for the school to know how to support him and what strategies to use to help him learn.  Places in these schools are usually limited, but you may be able to get him a place just as a mainstream pupil. But I'm talking about in the UK, so things might be completely different where you are.
The more you find out about autism/aspergers the more you will understand your child and how it affects him.  Every child is different.

1126,Concerned friend,"
        Your friend's child should receive a developmental screening. I am particularly concerned about her delayed motor development. Many parents avoid seeking professional advice for fear of their child being labeled. Also, many parents are advised to wait to see how children develop on their own. We know that healthy children vary in their development, but we also know that early intervention is very effective. Therefore, I encourage families to share any developmental concerns with their pediatrician and to get recommended screenings. I assume that the child visits her pediatrician regularly. If so, I would expect the pediatrician to pick up on these developmental issues. If for some reason this process has not worked, I recommend that you try to address this subject in a supportive way.

1127,Concerned friend,"
        She may/may not be on the spectrum, only assessments and observations can decide that.  
If she is repeating things said to her, or is repeating things from TV/DVDs etc whether it is words or songs or sounds then she might be echolalic.  Google echolalia and autism and see if that sounds similar.
Covering her ears at sound could be Sensory Integration Disorder.  Many, if not all, individuals on the autistic spectrum have sensory differences which range from mild to severe (quote by Temple Grandin).  An Occupational Therapist should assess for this and put together a programme.
The sooner any therapies are started the better the outcome.
Rather than bringing up 'autism' would it be possible to mention echolalia or sensory integration disorder as something you came across whilst on the internet and thought it reminded you of this child?  It is a very difficult subject, and it does depend on how close you are to your 'friend'.  Has the child been for regular check-ups with the paediatrician to make sure she is meeting her developmental milestones?
Usually the first professional to assess any child is the Speech and Language Therapist because most of these children have difficulties with speech and social interaction.  If her speech is poor then that could be an avenue you could bring up because all children need sufficient communication and language skills for nursery and school otherwise they won't be able to communicate or understand what is being asked of them.

        Thank you for reply.  I will google echolalia and do some research.  Yes, she has been for regular check-ups, but I also believe that they are mis-informing their doctor, because they do not want to acknowledge any developmental delays.  The words that she does speak are very clear, but are repeated words.  Besides that, I have not seen her communicate her needs/wants/emotions.  We are very good friends, which is why I find it most difficult to say anything but her parents are not the easiest people to speak to as they are very private.  Thanks again.

1131,Does my son have Asperger's or something similar?,"
        I thought I'd post about a couple of things that have helped my son (age nearly 8) with socialising and playing.
At his school I have asked them to give him an option of what to do at playtime (this happens during afternoon play).  He has a choice of two activities and chooses what he wants to do.  Then he has a choice of two classmates and who he wants to do the activity with (these classmates have already previously agreed to play anything with him).  This has helped him enormously because playtime would come, and he would go into the playground with nothing planned and all the other kids would start playing and he didn't know how to join in.  This has built his confidence, and also given him the structure to be successful in play.  During afternoon play there is always a teaching assistant in the playground keeping an eye on things.
My son also goes to a school that is for mainstream children as well as those on the autistic spectrum.  So most of the classes have a number of autistic children in them.  There is also a specialist unit where there are more severe children, and the staff expertise and experience is passed onto the teachers and assistants in the mainstream school through training etc.
The school also have a number of different dinnertime clubs.  So 2-3 times a week he goes to one of the clubs.  Again this helps because his time is structured rather than him wandering around the playground repeating film dialogue to himself.  
The school also has a weekly Social Skills Club, where social interaction skills are taught in a group with lots of role play.
As part of his IEP, he has a target to initiate conversation.  The school have done this by sending him to another member of staff to ask them a question (this question has been told to him eg. Ask Mrs Harris what her favourite TV programme is.  Then he will go and ask her and has to come back and give the answer.  This helps to teach him conversation.  He tends to talk at people and not ask them questions or pay attention to what they say to him.
I also found a very good Play Therapist who had experience of children on the autistic spectrum and she did something similar to Greenspan Floortime with him.  This is working one to one with the child and using their interests to interact.  This really helped him find that communicating and playing with another person could be very enjoyable.  This has made him motivated to interact.  Alot of the time these children have negative outcomes from trying to socialise or communicate.  In those circumstances, because of repeated failures, they are not motived.  We wouldn't be motivated to attempt something we always failed at.  If you can work through his interests in situations that are one to one rather than large groups he will have more success.
As a family we also found it very helpful to join a parent support group.  The one we go to is held once a fortnight in a local community college.  All the children go to play in the gym.  They put out all the equipment, as well as a trampoline and blow-up bouncy castle.  They have 2-3 adults to supervise.  This group is open for children on the spectrum, their siblings and their friends (so they can invite school friends to go along as well).  The parents meet in the staffroom and have coffee/biscuits etc.  You get alot of advice and support from groups like this.
As you have found yourself, it is not that these children don't want to communicate or interact, they just don't have the necessary skills to do so successfully.  They need to be taught these skills because they don't pick them up automatically like we did from watching and learning.  A Speech and Language Therapist is usually the professional who would assess social interaction skills.  But having a school where all the teachers are aware of the difficulties and strengths that these children have is extremely important.

1133,My grandson's obsession with internet games a problem,"
        I strongly recommend that you limit access to video games and continue to expose your grandson to other activities that are of interest to children his age. He is probably more successful with video games than he is during other activities, especially those that are socially challenging. So, it makes sense that he wants to spend time playing video games. But, his opportunities to exand his interests and skills will be limited if he is allowed to only play these games. The video game probably should be removed from his bedroom so that you can limit his access. Placing the game in a common living area also provides the opportunity for playing video games to become more of a social activity.

        Hello Rachel,
        In response to your answer, There is no internet or any other games in his bedroom. Never has been.  He does play it in the living room with family members around. Sometimes he sneaks to the living room during the night. We have tried board games where there is interaction with others but this doesn't last long. He has shown interest in wanting to study Astronomy,earth sciences, or genetics, We have encouraged using the internet to read about these topics instead playing the games. We have also gone to the library for information on the same but he gets other books that are fiction.He even thought Walt Disney World was boring.
He does not mix well with others, He is more of a loner, nosies upset him.He is very strong minded. His social skills are lacking. If he feels anyone is wrong in any conversation he hears he promptly correct you. When he was in the school system he would correct any teacher that he thought was making  an error.
He was tested in first grade & results were astounding. His math at age 6 was of a 16 year old. School subjects at this present time are beyond high school level, but not doing well because they are boring.
His IQ is so high he can accomplish anything if we could just get him interested in a subject. To force him just makes him more angry.

        I sympathize with you.  I have an 11 year old Aspie daugther--same IQ and issues.  She does like video games, but spends most of her time online, endlessly researching whatever interests her at the moment.  Until you live with an Aspie, you don't understand that you cannot force them to do anything they don't want to do, and they do not like things that ""typical"" kids their age do.  I understand leaving the public school to homeschool.  I homeschooled for 4 years.  My daugther is now in a public school contained classroom that totally understands Asperger's, so she is allowed to be herself, while they continuously work on social rules and interactions.  Academics isn't even involved here--she is so far ahead of everyone anyway (she does do some work, but it is way below her level).  The program has been so good for her that we kept her back this year in the classroom.  Even being around other Aspies, and others with different diagnoses, has really helped her see herself, and have compassion for others who are different.  We don't know what we're going to do next year though.  If you could find a program like this for your grandson, that would be great for him.  But I know how difficult it is to find as they are so few and far between.  Good luck to you.

        I would also like to add that Aspies are never going to be ""typical"" or ""normal"".  At this point I would be focusing on his interest--video games--and trying to figure out how to make him as successful as he can in life.  There are now colleges that offer degrees in video game programming.  He would probably be awesome at it!  He could probably pass a GED if you could get him to take it.  Maybe if he knew he could be done with ""school"" and go on to to study his interests and one day make money off it, it may be a motivator.  As a society we have lost the fact that we have interests and gifts because they are what we're supposed to be doing.  No wonder so many people are unhappy with their careers.

        Go to Google.com and type in video game degree.  There are alot of online degree programs.  He probably wouldn't even have to a have a GED to do that.  Try calling a local college and see if they have a program.  They should be able to direct you to a college that does, if they don't.  You will have to check locally about the GED requirements, but there are many other smart, young kids who have graduated and go to college, so I would think he would be able to.  Especially with his diagnosis.  If he does go to a college (not do it online), many colleges now work with students with special needs to make accomodations for their diability so they will be successful.  Good luck to you and keep us posted!

        Also, you need to know that just because your school does not have the knowledge to deal with Aspergers, they are REQUIRED BY LAW to get that knowledge, or send that child somewhere that does have the knowledge.  And that could mean to another state, to a private school, whatever--at their cost!  We had that issue.  Our local school could not deal with my daugther.  Luckily we found a school within our intermediate school district that works, but our local school is required to transport her there, and they pay that school, too.  I have heard of cases where a public school pays for specialized private school for children they cannot education.  That is their duty.

1140,My grandson's obsession with internet games a problem,"
        I agree with MaryannesMom.  Working through their interests is the motivator.
Regarding education you have to find out what you and the child's educational rights are by law.  There are all the supports out there, but if you don't push for them and demand them as a legal right, no one is going to offer them to you on a plate.  Unfortunately everything is run on budgets and therefore it is not in their interests to find out what his needs are and offer the supports for him to be successful in school/college or university.  
I'm in the UK, so I don't know what the Autistic Society of America is like for information and advice, but it might be a starting point to send you in the right direction.
Always remember to put requests in writing and always follow up any verbal or telephone communication with the school etc with a letter confirming what was discussed and what was agreed.  That is your legal evidence incase you ever need to go to an educational tribunal.  It proves that you asked and they didn't meet this childs needs.  That proves they acted illegally.
I think that Speech and Language Therapists should be much more involved with children with Aspergers, but they are considered too able because they can speak.  But they have many language and social interaction/communication difficulties with things like echolalia, Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder, poor auditory memory and auditory processing.  All these things impact on education and social interaction and the SALT is responsible for this area and should be putting teaching supports in place (eg. written notes instead of just verbal ones, a scribe to take down notes for them if they cannot read and listen at the same time, voice activated computer programmes if writing and typing is difficult etc.  They should also be putting into place social interaction groups where there can be role play teaching basic social skills.
You are on the right track even to be on this forum asking questions.  You don't need to apologise for this child's behaviour or be grateful for any morsal of help they provide.  This is a medical condition that is for life and this child will need these supports throughout his life.  Get clued up, and start demanding your rights.

     Thank for your interest. Our local schools were tried Kindergarten thru 7 th grade with great difficulty with the school district. No matter how much was demanded, it didn't work. Even had IEP meetings! Teachers just said he was a misbehaved child & not corrected within the family. There is very little autisum support in my area. With much frustation with the schools we are now home schooling for the second year. We are from a small town with little support system in place in our community. Here in America there is 1 autisic child out of every 150 children !  Some of our actress & actors are now coming forward to try & help to find out what is happening in our society to cause this problem, Mercury in baby shots, Our emviroment, born with it??

        I know alot of parents have to resort to home schooling.
But there are laws out there.  Sometimes if you involve a solicitor and can prove that the state cannot provide an education for your child to meet his needs, you can get the state to pay for private education.  SueNYC has done that.  I don't know if that would be useful in your circumstances.
As he is being homeschooled, does that mean that professionals such as Speech and Language Therapist and Educational Psychologist come out to your house?  Or do they try not to do anything at all?  Again find out what is your legal rights.  Those children that are home schooled need more input in areas such as social communication and interaction.  Again this is best addressed through using their interests, but a qualified professional SALT should be helping you and your family with this.  They can't expect every family to be experienced in all areas to the level of the professionals, that is unrealistic.
For example, there will certainly be other families in your area with exactly the same issues.  You could form a club where parents can meet eachother and children can socialise through computer games or visiting eachothers houses etc.  These are all life skills that these children need to learn because as adults they will have to interact with the outside world.  Don't feel bad or guilty about that - get angry and start demanding that these needs are met.  If you take on full responsibility for every aspect of this childs educational and social development the state will be more than happy to let you get on with it because it saves them money.

        I know that money is always an issue.  Make sure you have a benefits check to ensure you are getting all the financial help available to you.
You could also phone the BCBA and find out what it would entail.  Sometimes you make an initial number of appointments, but once you know the programme you may only have to report back by phone on a regular basis, but only go to see them once a quarter.  It might also be possible to send video footage of sessions at home to show the BCBA how your son is doing.

        Steady state behavior is stable responding and transition state responding is behavior undergoing change from one steady state to another.  There are many ways to measure behavior that undergoes a transition but that requires that behavior is stable before and after transition.  This is not as difficult or complex as it may sound but I suggest going to Murray Sidman's ""Tactics of Scientific Research"" (1960).  It details analyzing behavior in steady states and transition states and is available through www.behavior.org (in the book store under behavior analysis tools).

If the question is about measure the behavior of transition (as in moving from one place to another) in a single subject design, I suggest that you take a look at the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis.  Go to the abstract search and type in the keyword transitions.  Several studies using single subject designs are reported there.  One excellent example is pasted below:

McCord, B. E., Thomson, R. J., & Iwata, B. A. (2001). Functional analysis and treatment of self- injury associated with transitions. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 34, 195-210.
We applied functional analysis methodology to the assessment and treatment of 2 individuals' self-injurious behavior (SIB), which was reported to be occasioned by transitions from one activity or location to another. A structural (task) analysis of activity transitions identified at least three separate components that might influence behavior either alone or in combination: (a) termination of a prechange activity, (b) initiation of a postchange activity, and (c) movement from one location to another. Results of preference and avoidance assessments were used to identify activities to which participants were exposed in varying arrangements during transitions in a functional analysis. Results of 1 participant's functional analysis indicated that his SIB was maintained by avoidance of having to change locations, regardless of the activity terminated prior to the change or the activity initiated following it. The 2nd participant's analysis revealed the same function but also an additional one: avoidance of certain task initiations. This information was used to identify transition contexts during intervention and to design treatment procedures appropriate for a given context and behavioral function. A procedure involving advance notice of an upcoming transition had no effect on SIB, and differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) had limited effects in the absence of extinction. Sustained decreases in SIB were observed when DRA was combined with extinction and response blocking. Further extensions of functional analysis methodology to the assessment of problem behavior in situations characterized by multiple or protracted stimulus changes are discussed.

1152,How do I know if my son has aspergers,"
        Asperger’s Disorder is diagnosed based on narrow or repetitive patterns of behavior or interests and severe and sustained impairment in social interactions. Given the number of problems you are seeing and the impairment it is causing for him at school and home, you should speak with your pediatrician – only a professional who sees your child in person will be able to provide you with an accurate diagnosis.  Whether he is diagnosed with a spectrum disorder or not, I’d also suggest that you consider seeing a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) to address some of the behavior problems that you are seeing. You can find a BCBA in your area at the BABB website (http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html).

1153,How do I know if my son has aspergers,"
        The first step would be to go to your GP and ask for a multi disciplinary team assessment by professionals who have experience of diagnosising autism and aspergers.  The first professional to go in is usually the Speech and Language Therapist.  Alot of the difficulties you have mentioned could be down to communication and speech disorders.
It is totally unacceptable that the teacher refused to work with you on your son's difficulties.  She is being more 'autistic' then your son!!!
If you feel that this school is not able to deal with his very real difficulties that are not down to him being spoilt, naughty, or rude, then it might be better to look for another school that does have other pupils on the spectrum and which has experience of teaching children with autism or aspergers.  These don't have to be special schools, although that too must be considered IF you think that is the environment that would suit him best.
Your son might have Disordered Speech; Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder, differences in his Receptive and Expressive speech (receptive speech is usually much weaker, delayed, or disordered); Auditory Processing Disorder or Delayed Auditory Processing.  When you google those and read them, if any sound relevant ask the SALT to assess your son for them.
Does your son ever repeat things he has heard on TV or in films, or does he repeat things you have said to him?
My son also did not ask for help in school.  This is down to a concept called 'generalisation' where those on the spectrum learning to do a certain skills in one environment or with one person (eg. at home with mum), but cannot use that same skill in a different environment or with a different person (eg. at school with a teacher).  This will apply to everything he learns and the teachers need to be working with you so that he learns things in many different environments and also with different people.

        Our son was 2 when nursery decided something wasn't right with our son and 5 years on at the age of 7 he was diagnosed last week with ASD Aspergers, ADHD and Dyspraxia.  The most common symptom was our son has no empathy, he upsets others really easily, prefers his own company and a need for a very strict routine.  The problem we found over the last 5 years is that he is super at school so our sons school wouldn't co-operate saying he was no different.  The ASD spectrum is so big that your son could be anywhere on it and the multi-disciplinary assessment took 2 years for our result.  Our son also has asthma, excema and night time incontinence (enurisis) as well as allergies to all kids medicines with a flavour (fructose intolerent).  If your GP has already suggested the aspergers ask for a referral to the multi disciplinary team which consisted for us of a Consultant Peadiatrician, Speech & Language Therapist and a Psychologist.  It could take time like ours took 2 years for the assessment but don't let the authorities fob you off that nothing is wrong.  We find our sons weekly psychologist appointments really help him so perhaps that might be your starting point for a referral seen as though they are involved with the assessment.  Good luck, just send me an e-mail if you want any more help.

        It is very important for you to share your concerns with the boy's family. It is so important to identify developmental concerns early and to begin appropriate intervention. It certainly sounds as though the child is experiencing a language delay, so it would be important to get him evaluated. I recommend setting up a meeting with the family. Your message is likely to be more well received if you can share your interest in the child's well being and share your commitment to helping. Many communities offer free screenings for children under the age of 3. You might check local resources to see if this is available. At the very least, the family should talk to their pediatrician.

        I understand that considering residential placement for your child is a very tough decision, but you should not feel guilty about decisions that you make in the best interest of your child. In many geographical areas there good group home options. In the best programs, the individuals served (and their families) benefit from access to appropriate programming implemented by well trained staff. These programs provide opportunities for the development of skills required for more independence (e.g., vocational skills, community skills, self care skills) as well as opportunities for peer interaction and appropriate leisure activities. Many parents find relief in handing these tasks over to trained professionals. This sometimes allows parents to simply enjoy the time they spend with their children.

        For a child that is severely affected it is difficult because you are a carer 24/7.  Over the years that really takes it toll on your physical and mental health.
Have you ever had respite care?
If he is capable of moving into group home then that can be something positive, as he will need to be prepared in a place for when you are not around any longer.
I have an older sister who has learning difficulties.  She doesn't sound as severe as your son.  She works in a special factory for disabled people.  She moved into a warden controlled housing association when she was in her late forties.  She is doing okay there.  Both my parents and my sister needed this to happen as they were unhappy living together.  Sometimes there can be very different personalities.  For example my mother is obsessed with cleaning.  My sister could not care less about that side of things.  The continual fights and arguments about that one subject were draining.
Regarding his behaviours, have you looked at Sensory Integration Disorder?  If any of his senses are over or under sensitive that can sometimes account for alot of autistic behaviour.  Google the name Olga Bogdashina and read an article by her printed in Autism Today.  If that sounds like your son then you can find a book by her called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  That might give you an insight into what his sensory perception is and therefore where his behaviours are coming from and what you can do to reduce them.
Regarding talking all the time.  Is he repeating things he has seen on TV or films, or things that have been said to him?  Or is he trying to talk to you about his interests all the time?

        His repeating things could be a number of things.
He could have auditory processing or auditory memory problems.  Sometimes they use a copying skill of repeating things to remember them, or to remember where they are in the conversation.
Those with autism can sometimes have something called perseverant speech.  This is when they ask the same questions over and over regardless of the answer you have given.  This may be tied into the need for rigid routines in autism and somehow the rigid interaction of always talking about something or asking the same questions over and over seems to fulfill this need.  Google it to see if it sounds relevant.  A speech therapist or psychologist should be able to give you some advice on this.
If he is repeating things he has heard on TV or in films or things people have said to him, then this is echolalia.  Again google it to see if it sounds relevant.
Find out what your options are.  Both you and your son have rights, and there could be services and supports out there to help you and to support your son in becoming as independent as he can be.
My mother never thought my sister would live independently.  But she does and she is happy doing so.

1161,my 4.5 daughter is masturbating,"
        I would certainly recommend that you investigate any medical reasons for this behavior, although I have encountered many young children who begin to masturbate without any medical reason. I am a bit concerned that your doctor would suggest abuse or seizures over the phone without an evaluation. I would suggest that you and your daughter's teachers interrupt her gently (by moving her hand if necessary) each time she touches herself inappropriately in public. Don't give a lot of attention while interrupting. Also, it would be worthwhile to try to increase your child's overall level of engagement in appropriate activities. Children with autism engage in many forms of self-stimulation, and this behavior may be one example. In addition to interrupting self-stimulatory behavior, it is important to teach your child to access more appropriate forms of stimulation through, for example, play.

        If your children both have very good, high-paying jobs it seems unlikely that they would be diagnosed with severe autism. The genetic contributions to autism have not been clearly identified, so it is not possible to accurately predict how autism will affect your family in the future. I would suggest that interested members of your family seek genetic counseling, which is available in most major urban hospitals. We do not yet know how to prevent autism, but there are certainly some effective interventions for the behavioral difficulties and social deficits associated with the disorder. Many families affected by autism are able to develop happy, loving relationships. If you are interested in a relationship with your children and grandchildren, I suggest that you and your family seek some professional support to address these issues.

        The most important thing that you can do for you child is to arrange for the best early intervention that you can find. Studies show that the best outcomes are acheived with early intensive behavioral intervention. These programs are specially designed to capitalize on the strenghts and interests of children with autism and to overcome their difficulties. Researchers are working hard to understand the causes of autism, but a full understanding is not yet available. Nevertheless, there is adequate research that points to effective intervention. It may be most fruitful to focus your energy on identifying the best services that you can find.

        Unfortunately the answers are not out there.
Some children diagnosed with autism do acquite some speech and then regress and lose it.  My son just didn't get that explosion of vocabulary at the age of 3+ that other children do.  Instead he started repeating things he heard from TV.  
There are many disorders that are not present at birth, but become active in childhood or even adulthood, especially the mucle wasting diseases.
I personally don't think vaccines are responsible, because my son was showing signs of autism before he had his MMR vaccination.  
I think there may be a genetic weakness or mutuation, but no-one has identified it yet.
Where are all these autistic children coming from?  Again no-one knows, but something is definately happening because diagnosis rates are going up and if that had always been happening then where are all the autistic adults??
Do not waste your time or energy on bizarre therapies that promise the earth.  There is no cure or recovery.  There are ways to help them improve and develop and some children do so well that they are considered to be outside of the diagnostic criteria.  But that is for a few, not for all (although all do develop and improve and gain skills as they get older).
As your son likes to look at the chandelier and likes to spin, I would suggest he is assessed by an Occupational Therapist who has experience of Sensory Integration Disorder as well as autism.  Many (if not all) those on the autistic spectrum have sensory differences meaning they do not perceive things as we do.  Some noises, smells/tastes/textures/touch can be too much for them to tolerate.  Or, if they are undersensitive they may spin, or stare at visual stimulus, or appear deaf, or appear not to feel pain etc.  It is important that you begin to get a understanding of this and how this will affect your childs development and social interaction because it will help you make the right choices about the kinds of supports he needs.  
When he is a bit older I would suggest he is screened for Irlen Syndrome (google that to see what it is).  This affects the visual sense and can be rectified just by wearing Irlen tinted lenses in glasses.  Those with problems with visual perception sometimes do not see things as we do.
Balance and co-ordination are also senses.  Some children might appear to have poor balance, or be clumsy or they may be almost like untaught gymnasts.  I know a boy who joined the county trampoline team having never had a lesson in his life, but he can do all the movements immediately, it is amazing to watch.
As he is so young I would also ask the OT to give you advice about the kinds of activities that can improve brain development.  These will be things like crawling eg. buy those fabric tubes and play hide and seek with him.
As he is not verbal you need the Speech Therapist to show you how to use symbols and for you to use them to show your son the daily routine.  This will be something like a timetable, but the structure and routine should help him understand and cope better with change.
As your child grows try to get him involved in as much one to one stuff as you can.  Anything he is interested in get him to do it with something eg. lego, swimming, drum lessons, fishing etc etc.  They tend to do much better in one to one situations and really struggle in group or team work.  Use any interests or obsessions to teach concepts and to encourage social interaction.
I know it is a bombshell to get a diagnosis.  And you will need time to grieve for the child you thought you had and for the future you thought was infront of them.  That is natural.  You will have some really dark days, but it will pass and it does get better.  
My son is at a mainstream school that has experience and expertise in autism.  He is in a class with 20 other children.  He can talk and communicate.  He can make jokes and tease me and even lie convincingly!  He likes to play (although he needs adult support sometimes or structure to do this).  He is assessed as being above average intelligence.  
If I were you I would be wanting him assessed by an OT and a psychologist.  I would also be looking around at nurserys and infant schools that have experience of teaching those with autism.
I would also recommend joining a parent support group because you will get lots of information and advice from other parents who have already been through what you are going through now.

        Regarding communication with your child, you need the Speech and Language Therapist to be showing you how to use symbols and words.  Ask them to do that.
Regarding vaccines.  My son was showing autism before he had the MMR vaccination because he had the injection later than usual.  If he had had it on time then the onset of his autistic behaviours would have started at around the same time.  Most children are diagnosed at 3+, which is the age the MMR vaccination is administered.  So I think it is just a co-incidence.  
I used a private Play Therapist for my son which helped him want to communicate and socialise alot more.  But you need to find one that has experience of speech and communication disorders as well as autism.

        Your daughter definitely needs to be evaluated. Hitting herself when she is frustrated is very serious. I would suggest that you go try to identify a hospital in LA where they specialize in diagnosis of children who present developmental delays including autism. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations. You can then take these recommendations to your local early intervention program. A diagnosis does not typically involve lab work so this should not be a priority. Hearing and vision screening should be high priority. 

The most effective treatment for children with autism is early intensive behavioral intervention. This means that your daughter receives a diagnosis of autism, she should receive 20 hours of direct teaching in language, social skills and self-help skills. Services can be provided by early intervention in your area. You may want to look for behaviorally trained professionals to supervise a treatment program by checking www.bacb.com for a person in your area.

        You really need your child to be seen by a number of professionals including Speech and Lanaguage Therapist, Clinical Psychologist and Occupational Therapist.
She may have autism, which can range from mild to severe.  My son is on the autistic spectrum and some of the things you mention sound familiar.  But I am a parent, not a professional.
It sounds like she may have sensory issues which an OT should be able to help with.  Google DSM IV for autism and look at the criteria to see if it sounds like your child.  Also google Sensory Integration Disorder to see if that applies.  But appearing over and under sensitive through the senses is classic.  So she might appear deaf at one time and then appear to hear the smallest sound at another time.  She might have difficulties with how her clothes feel.  She might cover hear ears at noise, she might have balance and co-ordination problems, or her balance and co-ordination might be better than other children.  She might have problems with the taste, texture and smell of food.  
If she has problems chewing she might have dyspraxia, which might also affect her ability to speak.  
Being fascinated by certain visual stimuli is also classic of both autism and sensory integration disorder.  That may also indicate she may have Irlen Syndrome which is something you could test for later, but which is rectified by wearing glasses with tinted irlen lenses.  Google Irlen Syndrome to see about that.
The fact that she doesn't play with toys and gets frustrated and hits and bites herself is also classic to autism.  That is due to a lack of imagination and flexibility of thought that can make it hard for them to know how to play.
Regarding waiting for assessments.  Some universities specialise in diagnosising autism and you might be able to get an assessment sooner and for free.  In the USA you could try contacting the Autistic Society of America for advise with that.
I would also recommend you repeat this post in the autism forum as there may be other parents in your area/country that could give you some advice.

        Please share you concerns with your pediatrician. It is important to watch your child's development closely and to seek help when you have concerns. It does not sound as though your child is showing any significant delays, but there are some easy things that you can do to encourage language development. There are several commercially available curriculum resources to guide parents and professionals to promote healthy development.

        Yes those on the autistic spectrum can show affection.  But you have to remember that sometimes it is inappropriate or it is not generalised.  That means that some children might be totally uninterested in other children whilst others might be overly friendly and touching and hugging them all the time.  Both extremes are inappropriate.  In your case your daughter is affection with you but not with other people because she hasn't learnt 'who' she should be affection with ie. familiar people vs strangers, and she hasn't learn't 'how' to do it.  Ie. you might just give a friendly greeting to someone you know slightly, but might hug another family member.  These difficulties with social interaction and social communication will be lifelong.  A Speech and Language Therapist should assess these skills and a programme should be put into place to teach her.

        As you may know, Asperger's Disorder is characterized by social deficits and restricted/repetitive behavior patterns. It is important to recognize that many typically developing children show some behavior that is consistent with autism spectrum disorders (e.g, some children are less social or more interested in an ordered environment). Nevertheless, I recommend that you discuss your concerns with your pediatrician who will be able to evaluate your son based on a fuller picture. It is important to identify all developmental issues early so that the proper intervention can begin.

        A lot of what you describe falls into the autism/asperger's spectrum but the only way to know is to have him evaluated by a professional with experience with autism and asperger's. I think that it would be beneficial for you to take a look at some of the information about and resources for asperger's and autism because they will give you tips that will help regardless of your son's diagnosis. If he is socially inept, regardless of what it ends up being called, programs to teach social awareness will benefit him. If he is very resistant to eye contact then a desensitization program might help. (Have him look you in the eye and count to five using ""one, one thousand, two, one thousand and gradually increase the time up to about ten seconds. I actually taught myself eye contact using that method and most people don't realize I have Asperger's through casual contact with me.)

        Hi everyone, my experience might help you.  My daughter is now diagnosed as having Aspergers, but I can tell you it was a battle from the ages of 5 till 10, until I got someone to listen. Like you all I knew my daughter was struggling, she couldn't talk and was not able to look at me, was clumsy, was extremely quiet and will sit in the corner by herself playing with her toy. She was not responding to any stimuli we would provide. when she attended primary school, she became the opposite, loud, nervy, biting her nails, over familiar with people, did not understand safety issues, interaction with others became more strained, isolation etc, she became obnoxious, rude, no boundaries even though they were taught to her, whats right an wrong. Highly emotional, outbursts etc. eventually I had enough and decided it was going to be a warfare with Authorities to get help and support for a child I knew was struggling, we all knew she had special needs, but what extent. I insisted she spoke to a Child Psychologist, Doctors etc., I asked specifically to get her analyzed for ASD, eventually it all made sense, we did a test I answered questions, and she was finally diagnosed, as soon as this happened what a relief, now she has the support she needs. I think because society is only now waking up to Aspergers, it is slow in offering tests, and support, for now parents have to insist and fight for what is their right which is to have the kids seen be professional, we have to do the leg work, and we have to make sure they listen, find ways for them to listen, do our research well and take to them, unfortunately, these people dont know everything, because they dont know our children, we have to be sure of ourselves before we can assure others of what is going on with our kids.
So keep fighting for what you know and what rightly belongs to you, which is ANSWERS.

        He is just at the age when he should be starting to get more social, so you need to keep a watch on that.
If you think he is delayed in his speech then having him assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist won't do him any harm, and if he does need some extra help then he will be getting it from a very early age, which is also good because the earlier any therapies start they have a better chance of making good progress.
Children with autism do throw tantrums like you mention, but so do other 2/3 year olds.  The thing that is more noticeable is that, obviously it becomes age inappropriate when they are still doing it as they get older.  But it is usually around change or stopping/ starting things ie. if I had to turn off the TV to go out my son would get very upset, because he needs to see the TV programme to the end.  Their tantrums also 'seem' out of proportion to the thing that upset them.  So it appears like an over reaction.
Changes in routine can upset them or changes in expectations ie. if you said you were going to the supermarket, but then remembered you needed petrol and went to the petrol station first, then a child with autism might get upset by that.
There are also alot of sensory issues.  So, as you say they can appear deaf when you call their name, yet at other times they demonstrate acute hearing, or they may cover their ears at sudden unpredictable noise, or if you put the vaccum cleaner on.  They can be touch sensitive and complain that they have been hurt when they have only been touched or they can appear to feel no pain.  They may prefer certain types of fabrics, with tags removed, because otherwise it hurts their skin.  They can have problems around putting on socks and shoes.  They may complain about smells or tastes or textures, or appear to be unable to smell or like to taste non-food items.  They may also have problems with balance and co-ordination.  These sensory differences fluctuate between hyper and hypo sensitive throughout the day and day to day.  
Socially they may appear uninterested in other children, or they may appear to want to join in but don't seem to know how.  Or if they do join in they can't understand the rules of the game or what is expected of them.
They can have some imagination, but certain types of imagination may be poor or missing.  Google theory of mind to see what that is, as most children on the spectrum have difficulties with that. 
There can also be certain repetitive behaviours of mannerisms such as flapping (which is suspected of being a sensory thing), or spinning round, walking on tip toes, following lines on the floor, walking up and down or round in circles.
The only way that a diagnosis can be given is through observations and assessments.  So if you are really concerned, then the first stage would be to go to your GP and express your concerns and ask for him to be referred to a Speech and Language Therapist.

        Follow your gut and have him evaluated!!  The earlier the better.  I had some of the same concerns about my son at this age.  I repeatedly asked his pediatrician and she said I had nothing to worry about. But I knew something was a little ""off.""   I followed my gut and had him evaluated by regional center. Turns out he had ""red Flags"" for developing Autism! 
I live in Ornage County and thankfully we have an amazing Early Intervention Program for children under the age of 3.  He qualified for 5 hours per week of Speech, Behavior and OT therapy.  It ended up getting bumped to 15 /hours per week, which I know sounds like a lot, but it changed my son's life.  I truly think the therapists had a profound impact on my son. At his IEP meeting at three he didn't qualify for the special ed preschool.  He is now 4 years old and doing wonderfully. He is totally ""typical,"" has many friends and is so social.  I feel that he has gained wonderul coping skills and his behavior is amazing!  
My thoughts going into deciding to have him evaluated were,""It can't hurt him.""  I know it is scary, but do it. I truly believe if I hadn't intervened and got him that therapy, he would be a totally different child.

        The person to get involved would probably be an Occupational Therapist.
If he is having such problems with food I suspect he has sensory issues with either the taste, texture or smell of food.  Or he has rigid behaviours and routines that allow him to only eat certain foods and only when they are presented in a certain way.
What are his other senses like?  Is he okay with sound or does he cover his ears or appear deaf.  Is he touch sensitive or does he appear not to feel pain.  Does he have to wear certain types of clothes and have tags removed etc.  Is his balance and co-ordination okay?
If he does have sensory issues these can fluctuate between being over and under sensitive throughout the day.

        Sally44 is probably right about an occupational therapist being a great resource. My grandson has classic Autism and we have to fight with him on food issues too. He is *extremely* resistant to vegetables, even corn which most children like. His school works with him on this and we follow their lead. What we do is require a ""no thank you"" bite of food. We had to build up to it though. First he just had to ""kiss"" the food that he rejected. Then he had to touch it with his tongue. Now he will take a bite. We watch for textures that he particularly hates and don't push those issues -- like mashed potatos. lol Our entire family has textures we simply won't tolerate -- for Aidan's mom it's ""slimy"" foods (like guacamole dip) for me, it's cooked mushrooms, so we're sensitive to what Aidan is going to really resiste eating. But a single bite over time can lead to great variability in food eaten. Aidan eats salad, sometimes carrots with ranch dip, and a wide variety of meats. He adores noodles of all kinds and I will make homemade fried chicken tenders for him because he really loves McDonalds chicken nuggets too.

One option for vitamins I would suggest is gummy vitamins. They look, taste and feel like candy so most kids love to take them. Good luck and don't give up. With autism patience and persistence are virtues not to be taken lightly.

        Oh, I forgot to mention the reinforcers. Aidan has two main ""reinforcers"" for cooperating with us. One is video games (which he is hopelessly addicted to at the age of 5) and the other is candy. We use candies like skittles and M&Ms so that we can give him one or two small pieces for doing what we ask of him. (That way he isn't getting too sugared up.) We will remove video game time if he makes a bad choice. (Usually that's for wetting his pants while playing, though. Mostly we would give him extra video game time for trying his no thank you bite.)

        I would expect that a behavioral intervention would be succesful in reducing your son's aggression, but I do recognize that it can be difficult to identify professionals qualified to help. I recommend that you visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (bacb.com) where you will find a directory of service providers by state. In most cases, interventions involve teaching the child to communicate appropriately (e.g., for ask for attention or a toy, or to request a break from an unpleasant activity) and to decrease the ""pay off"" for aggressive behavior (e.g., minimize attention, don't ""give in"" following tantrums). Your child should be receiving speech services. It is much easier to discourage aggressive behavior and tantrums when a child has more appropriate ways to communicate.

It would be really useful if triggers to these aggressive behaviours can be established as this way, you will be able identify the causes and try to deal with them more effectively.

If he is verbal, then you could perhaps start with teaching him very simply negotiation vocab. e.g. stop it, i don't like it, no, etc.  

Ensure that you are not reinforcing any tantrum behaviour and try to re-direct the behaviours to something more appropritate wherever possible.

        Asperger's Disorder is diagnosed based on significantly impaired social interaction and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. You described a number of social difficulties, but repetitive behavior/restricted interests seem to be much less of a concern. In any case, a diagnosis can only be made by a qualified professional who conducts a thorough in-person assessment. I recommend having your son seen by a professional who specializes in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders. This individual should be able to peform the appropriate assessment and provide some recommendations for appropriate services. Whether or not your son receives a diagnosis, it will be important for you to work with your son's school to improve his social skills and to address the bullying that is going on. As I am sure you know, peer social interactions only become more challenging, so it is important to provide children the skills they need to be successful early on.

        I would also recommend he was assessed by a multi-disciplinary team that has experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.
What is his speech like.  Does he repeat things he has seen on TV or things you say to him.  Does he appear not to understand what you have said to him.  Can he follow instructions.
My son also doesn't have repetitive behaviours.  Occasionally he flaps or spins, but it is hardly noticeable.  Does he need any other routines or does he show rigid behaviours.  Can he cope with change.
As he is having difficulties at playtime, the supports that are usually provided for those on the spectrum is for them to be allowed to go into the library or computer suite.  But you need a Speech and Language Therapist to assess his speech and social interaction skills.  She can then put together a programme which may include him playing with another child during recess (playtime in the UK).  That can be supported to the extent your child needs.  For example my son is given the option of choosing what he wants to do at playtime (out of a choice of two things), and he can also choose who he wants to do it with.  The teacher already has a number of mainstream children who are willing and capable of playing with my son.  Your son might not need that amount of support.  But his social skills such as sharing, taking turns etc needs to be looked at first.
Is he aware of being teased or being bullied.  Does he understand lanaguage that has double meanings or sayings such as 'pull your socks up'.

        That's a hard one to answer.  You tend to have an idea of what a 'typical' child is going to achieve.  When a child is born on the spectrum they don't come with a manual (although it would be useful if they did!).  They tend to develop differently at different times and at different rates.
All you can do it try to meet whatever his particular difficulties are.  There are many people on the spectrum with jobs (teachers, doctors, lawyers) at the top end of the scale.  So there is no limit to what they can achieve, but only time will tell what they are capable of.  Since my son was diagnosed I have met a number of adults on the spectrum just because I tend to 'mention' his diagnosis if we go out somewhere.  For example, my daughter had her last birthday at a climbing club and I phoned them beforehand to inform them of my son's diagnosis so that they were aware of it.  The instructor we had for that day told me afterwards that he was diagnosed with Aspergers as an adult.  
So although you cannot stop yourself looking into the future.  Try to concentrate on the present and maybe the next 2-3 years only.  And that is only because it usually takes 1-2 years to get things sorted.

Have a look at Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder to see if that sounds relevant.
You would also want them to assess your son for his social communication and interaction skills.

1200,Son with Aspegers odd habit- Need help,"
        It would be helpful to talk with your pediatrician about your son's diet to determine what you can do to relieve constipation. It sounds like you have been very supportive, and that approach is important. Punitive approaches to toileting issues can exacerbate problems like holding bowel movements. Be sure to let your son know that you are available to help him in the bathroom if he needs it. Some children have difficulty cleaning themselves and then make the problem worse trying to cover up the mess. Children sometimes have more success with flushable wipes that are available in most grocery stores. If necessary, you might try a reward system for bowel movements. This might encourage your son to have bowel movements on a more regular schedule. This approach would also encourage your son to draw posititive attention to his bowel movements rather than hiding and feeling ashamed. You could also require a clean bathroom for the reward, but offer to help in anyway he needed to keep the bathroom clean.

        Thank you so much for the insight.  I have brought this to the attention of my sons pediatrician and she told me to give him childrens laxatives when he is constipated.  Which I have and he is not struggling with the constipation any longer.  I think now he is just dealing with the fear of it happening again.  I will try the flushable wipes as well as encouraging him to keep the bathroom clean.  I will keep you updated on the progress.  Thank you again.

        My son is also on the spectrum.  If you think he needs the extra support for a while then go into the bathroom with him and support him through the process.  You can always work at reducing that support again gradually as he gets back into the swing of things again.  Or you could give him a board with visual or written instructions for him to follow through.  
I agree that the moist wipes are alot easier than paper.
I think using laxatives for a while would be helpful so that he isn't fearful of a bowel movement.  But don't rely on them too long as they can build up a tolerance to them and the bowel can become lazy.

1203,Why does my 5 year old repeat me and doen;t answer my questions?,"
        While echolalia is common in children with autism, that alone is not sufficient to make a diagnosis. I would suggest that you go try to identify a hospital in an urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children with autism and other developmental delays. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations. You can then take these recommendations to your local school system. 

The most effective treatment for children with autism is early intensive behavioral intervention. This means that your son should receive 20 hours of direct teaching in language, social skills and self-help skills. Services can be provided by the public school in your area. You may want to look for behaviorally trained professionals to supervise a treatment program by checking www.bacb.com for a person in your area.

        Echolalia is related to autism.  I don't know if you can have echolalia without autism.  My son is echolalic and he also can put together his own speech as well.  He is age 7.  It is very good that he is speaking.  Does he also use Delayed Echolalia eg. pieces of dialogue phrases or words from TV or films?  The Speech and Language Therapist should be able to tell you more about it.  I would specifically be asking for a Speech and Language Therapist who also has experience of autism.
Does your son mix up his pronouns eg. I, me, you, yours, mine, us etc.
What is your son's social interaction skills like?
Are there things that your son is good at eg. puzzles, lego, pattern recognition etc.
Are the people/professionals, who have seen him so far, experienced in diagnosising autistic spectrum disorders such as PDD/NOS, Autism, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Aspergers, High Funtioning Autism etc.  If not I would be specifically asking for a referal to a centre/unit that does.

1205,Desperate need to control possibly asperger's?,"
        If this behavior occurs with individuals other than you and your husband, I recommend that you have your son seen by a professional who specializes in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders, including aspergers. I would be particularly concerned about your son's social interactions with peers. As you know, social competence is vital to success in school; therefore, it will be important to know how your son behaves at school and to work with the school to intervene if necessary. If this behavior is restricted to your son's interactions with you and your husband a different approach would be reasonable. An ongoing challenge for all parents is to promote independence and self-dermination in their children, while still playing the role of the parent. This is especially difficult in the role of step mother. It will be important for you to work with your husband to agree upon some limits for your son. He should not be allowed to be disrespectful to you and your husband, and he should be required to follow the adult's lead at times. However, there should be some times (e.g., playing certain games) when your son is allowed to make the rules. Restricting his control to certain situations should make it clear who is in control when.

1206,Desperate need to control possibly asperger's?,"
        It might be.  Have you looked at the diagnostic criteria for Aspergers.  Google 'DSM IV Aspergers' and read through the list of characteristics.  Remember a person only has to get a couple of the characteristics out of each list.
A need to control could be down to a need for predictable outcomes and also a lack of imagination.  Does he tend to re-enact things he has seen on TV or in films.
What is his language like and his tone of voice.  He seems to be unaware of how to hold a conversation properly which is very common.  He isn't being rude, he just doesn't realise that conversation is a two way process.  At the moment he seems to be giving dialogues and is talking at other people, again this is typical of Aspergers.
He might also have some rigid rituals or routines which could also include the need for certain foods to be served together and anything else considered to be wrong or unacceptable.
My son is high functioning autistic and he also comes across almost like a 'director' , especially in play.  He will tell you what you are, and what you should do.  You cannot deviate from this toryline.  If you tried he would curtail that route or he might start to get upset or angry with me.  That is because they need things to be predictable and therefore already know in their own mind what they want to happen.  If you use your imagination to change the play it completely throws them.
My son also accuses me of making him 'lose his place'.  That is usually when he is doing or saying something and I interrupt to ask him something or to clarify.  And it is true we have made them lose their place and usually they have to go back to the beginning and start again whether it is something they were thinking, saying or doing.
It is possible to talkative and bright and still be on the autistic spectrum.  Even Einstein was thought to have traits of autism!
His rituals at bedtime could be classed as repetitive rituals and routines under the diagnostic criteria.  
I think if it is becoming more noticeable that something is not quite right and if it is starting to impact on his ability to socialise with his peers then it might be time to raise concerns because he may need supports in school especially during breaktimes and dinnertimes so that he isn't bullied for being awkward or 'different'.
It might be a good starting point to say that you suspect that he may have Aspergers and ask for a Speech and Language Therapist with experience of Aspergers to assess both his speech and social communication abilities.

1207,Very intelligent but inattentive 5 yr old.,"
        The description you provided does not meet the diagnostic criteria for autism or aspergers, but I would certainly recommend sharing your concerns with your pediatrician who has or will be able to obtain a fuller picture of your child's development. Many children and adults of typical development show some characteristics (e.g. they are less social or prefer and orderly environment) similar to indivdiduals on the autism specturum. It seems that autism awareness has allowed a wider range of individuals to recognize these characteristics. In some cases, this awareness has led to early detection, but in others it has resulted in undue concern.

Whether or not a developmental issue is identified, it will be important to work with your daughter's school to improve the behaviors that are concerning. This will take some work on the part of your daughter, you, and her teachers. To start, adult may need to work a bit harder to gain your daughters attention. For example, instead of trying to gain your child's attention from across the room, adults may need to approach her, interrupt what she is doing, and gain eye contact. It would then be important to follow through with interactions initiated in this way. If you ask, her to do something, persist until the request is met. Otherwise, you would be teaching her to ignore you. This strategy is important with all children and is not the typical manner of interacting.

1208,Very intelligent but inattentive 5 yr old.,"
        she might be on the autistic spectrum at the 'gifted' end.  Or she might have some autistic traits, but not enough to get her a diagnosis.  These are a couple of things she might have difficulties with.  I am a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum.  Your post makes me wonder about the following:-
Firstly are you sure that her comprehension of her reading is good?  I would advise that a Speech and Language Therapist assesses her comprehension skills as well as her receptive and expressive language abilities to see how she does.  Autistic children can teach themselves to read, but sometimes there isn't the understanding behind it, or the understanding comes much later than the ability to read.
I would also ask that she is assessed for Semantic Pragmatic Speech Disorder (Google it and see if it sounds relevant).  Does she appear to have delays understanding speech eg. does she reply to questions about 10 seconds or more after being asked?
You say she can play and socialise okay.  Google Theory of Mind to see if that sounds relevent as those on the spectrum tend to have varying difficulties with this.
But the main thing you have posted sounds like Sensory Integration Disorder.  Someone who is at the forefront of this is a woman called Olga Bogdashina.  She has written a brilliant book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  Google her name and read an article by her in Autism Today.  Her book has a caregivers questionnaire at the back that you can complete to get sensory profile of your child.
But spinning rocking, appearing deaf, appearing blind (unable to see or recognise things in certain situations eg. not seeing a pencil on top of a desk) is typical of what Olga talks about.
You might also google Irlen Syndrome as those with autism, dyslexia and sensory perceptual problems can sometimes be greatly helped by just wearing these glasses with the tinted lenses.
If she has difficulty following instructions, organising and planning, understanding time etc then I would google Executive Function Disorder to see if that is relevant.
All of the different disorders I have mentioned are common to autism.  Some you can have without autism.  I think you might find some answers in some of those disorders.  Post back and let me know what you think?

1209,Very intelligent but inattentive 5 yr old.,"
        Thanks, Sally44.  I did some Googling this morning and decided that Semantic Pragmatic Disorder and Executive Function Disorder don't seem relevant here.  She really does have great comprehension when reading.  She's on a 2nd grade reading routine where she reads 3 books a week and then takes a written comprehension test on them.  She reads her own tests and has a 98% overall average for the year.

We have been digging a little more into Sensory Integration disorder, Her teacher actually suggested that last week.  But, while she shows many signs of this disorder, they are mostly very minor.  And we're not sure that some of her short-comings (like trouble using scissors and glue or sitting still and quiet in class) aren't just because she's the only kid in the class that didn't go to preshcool.  She's never been introduced to this type of structure for hours at a time.  What really bothers us is that you have to speak directly to her and make her repeat your request to get her to follow instruction.  One other thing...lately, she will only eat certain foods here at home and she's starving when she gets home from school.  I think maybe she isn't eating a good lunch. She used to be a good eater, but she will never eat mixed up foods. Her list of ""tolerable"" foods is getting shorter and shorter.  A casserole is definetly out.  I made the mistake of mixing hamburger into mac &cheese (2 of her favorite foods) and she literally gagged trying to eat it.

I dunno, maybe we're making to much of it...maybe she's just being 5.

1210,Very intelligent but inattentive 5 yr old.,"
        The things you are posting are sensory related, but you just don't recognise them as being such at the moment.  Some of the other behaviour might be autistic traits.
Trouble using sissors can be down to co-ordination.  That is the sense or proprioception.  Problems with glue, or things feeling sticky (whether they like or dislike them) can be down to the tactile sense of touch and sensation.  There might also be difficulties with washing/cutting hair, teeth, nails and clothes may need to be of certain fabrics or they may need their tags removed.  Or there can be interests in certain colours or patterns and children might insist on only wearing certain clothes or combinations of clothes.
Problems with sitting still might be down to attention and focus.  Can she pay attention for a long time on things she is interested in, but finds it hard to concentrate on whole class situations?  That might be an autistic trait or it could be an auditory processing difficulty or delay.  Children with autism usually function better one to one and find whole class instructions hard to understand because they need them to be addressed to them personally rather than a general instruction.  In some way they don't see themselves as being part of the 'group'.  If it is sensory based she may not be able to follow the class instructions at the speed the teacher is talking.  This is nothing to do with IQ, it is to do with how the brain is processing language.  It is quite possible to excel at reading and have great difficulties with spoken language (called receptive language), and there can be huge difference in expressive and receptive abilities which can only be assessed by a SALT.
Eventhough you say she is reading and comprehending books and sounds very advanced.  I would still suggest an assessment by a Speech and Language Therapist to assess all of her speech and communication skills to make sure that they are all developing at the same rate.  Children on the spectrum always tend to have a spiky profile.  This means they excel at certain things and yet find other simplier things hard or impossible to do.  For example my son scored on the 93rd percentile for spatial awareness and on the 2nd percentile for understanding verbal instructions.  That is a big difference.  Children developing 'typically' tend to get a similar percentile across the various skills with allowances for normal variations due to skills and abilities.  But the difference between 93 and 2 is just too great.
The senses of smell, taste and texture are closely linked.  My son also cannot bear foods to be mixed together as in casserole, soups, pies etc.  He cannot stand the textures of foods like beans and peas.  He will run away from certain food smells.  Again this is all sensory based.
If her senses are out of balance and are not being addressed it can cause other senses to get more and more sensitive as you describe.  Do you think any of her senses are undersensitive eg does she appear deaf, appear not to feel pain.  You have already said she can have difficulties seeing things in busy surroundings.  That is an under sensitive visual sense or difficulties with visual processing.  
I would definately recommend at least reading that article I mentioned by Olga Bogdashina and if it sounds useful going and buying her book to complete the questionnaire.  
Occupational Therapists are the professionals who deal with Sensory Integration.  But to be honest, they are quite behind what alot of parents of autistic children (and adult autistics) already know.  They tend to concentrate on the senses of touch/balance and co-ordination, but I think alot of research is underway about Sensory Integration.  The thing to understand is that it fluctuates day to day and throughout the day.  That is what makes it so difficult for them because the same experience can be perceived differently eg. on one occasion it might cause them discomfort, pain or repulsion, whilst at another time it could be enjoyable or even hard to understand.
What is her balance like (that is another sense), and her co-ordination (another sense).
Sensory difficulties are not part of the diagnosis for autism, although everyone thinks it will be included in the next version of the diagnostic criteria.
If your child is on the spectrum I think she is probably mildly affected with alot of talents and even some areas of gifted ability.  
Don't be afraid to look into what could be causing her difficulties.  These are very real and won't recitfy themselves.  With therapies, support and a school with experience of her difficulties she will improve and learn strategies to organise herself and to support herself in any areas of weakness.
My son is still in a mainstream school.  But it is one that also has autism unit for more severe children, so the teaching staff have alot of expertise.  My son is in a mainstream classroom, but he is given extra structure and support during lessons and playtimes.

It is scary to be looking at the idea of autism.  But

        I can certainly understand your frustration in finding a diagnosis that professionals can agree upon. At this point, it may be more fruitful to focus on intervention. Although diagnosis can be helpful in securing services, often diagnosis does not provide a prescription for intervention. You identified social skills and social boundaries as one particularly difficult area. The approach to improving his skills in this area would be the same indpendent of his diagnosis. I recommend that you work with your son's school and doctors to identify services to help him to improve in your areas of concern.

1212,totally lost,"
        Although you are being confused by alot of different possible diagnosis, all the variations being mentioned are still on the autistic spectrum.
Sometimes professionals can take the clinical diagnositic criteria too black and white.  For example my son can make eye contact.  But if he is trying to think about what he wants to say then no he cannot make eye contact.  
Their ability to function varies day to day and even throughout the day.  
From a sensory point of view they can appear deaf, cover their ears at noise, hear the slightest sound, or start banging on something to make noise.  This means that there is a great fluctuation in his ability to perceive and process auditory information.  All of his senses could be fluctuating in the same way.  When that is happening we cannot imagine how difficult it would be to make sense of anything.
Yes, those on the spectrum can play to some extent at some times.  You might find that alot of their play is re-enacting something they have already seen or heard.  They can also show some imagination, especially in their areas of interest.  They may express emotions and show affection to family members etc.  But they are still autistic.
It tends to become more obvious as they grow up.  A three year old might not behave differently to a family member and a stranger.  You would expect a 5 year old to know that you don't go up to a strange and touch, hug or kiss them.  So although they are showing affection and social interaction it is inappropriate and it is inappropriate because they don't understand social interaction as we do.
If he is eating non-food items that is sensory and is called Pica.
My son has only recently started lining up some toys and he is 7.  He likes to play war games using soldiers.  He doesn't have any obsessions apart from having to watch TV.  He doesn't need routines or rituals although he doesn't like change or changes to his daily timetable or if his expectations are not met.
My son also has a strange tone of voice and although we are in the UK he speaks with an American accent!
If I were you I would read up about autistic spectrum disorders.
As he has alot of sensory issues I would recommend a book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers by a woman called Olga Bogdashina.  This book has a questionnaire at the back that you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.  Our autism outreach department uses this questionnaire, so I know it is valid.
I would probably accept the diagnosis to get the therapies and supports in place and then see how your child develops and improves.  There is no way that they will continue with that diagnosis if he can demonstrate abilities that take him off the spectrum.  It is not unusual for a diagnosis to change over time or even to be removed.  My son is diagnosed as being High Functioning Autistic, but his paediatrican has said that if he develops obsessions that his diagnosis might change to Aspergers.
I think things will become much clearer with time.
Autism is not a physical problem that is permanent and inflexible.  It is neurological and therefore he may appear more autistic on some days than others.

        Autism is charaterized by deficits in language and social interaction as well as the presence of repetitive behavior. Therefore, it is difficult to identify this disorder until more social behavior and language are expected. However, please share your concerns about your son's interest in social interaction with your pediatrician, and encourage social interaction as much as you can. It is not uncommon for children at 7 months of age to wake frequently at night. Your pediatrician should be able to give recommendations to improve his sleep. Typically, it is helpful to (a) establish a clear bedtime routine, (b) put your baby to bed when he is tired but awake so that he can learn to put himself to sleep, (c) minimize interaction when your son wakes at night to encourage him to put himself back to sleep. Parents who adhere strictly to recommended sleep strategies typically see major improvements within 1 week.

        If you google 'DSM IV Aspergers', it will bring up the clinical criteria for diagnosising Aspergers.  This is a list of behaviours that the professionals will be looking at to decide if she has enough of those behaviours to get a diagnosis.
I am a parent of a child who has High Functioning Autism.  Alot of the things you mention as being 'weird' could be down to Aspergers.  But you really need to have your daughter assessed by a multi disciplinary team experienced in diagnosing autism.  Go to your doctor and ask for her to be referred to specialists that have experience of Aspergers.
You also mention alot of sensory seeking behaviour.  The cutting of fabric and fascination with water could be sensory.  What is she like with her clothes.  Do they have to have tags removed or be of a certain material.  She rocks, which is also sensory based, with a strong sense of smell and acute hearing.  That would indicate that she is experiencing things differently to you and others.  For example a 'normal' environment for you might be so loud it hurts her ears, with smells that are too strong.  She may have difficulties with 'feeling' where her own body is and so she rocks.  To avoid all these unpleasant sensations she may hide, or the hiding maybe to get into a small place to 'feel' squashed.  The professional to do an assessment would be an Occupational Therapist and you would want one who also has experience of Sensory Integration Disorder and Aspergers.
She also has interests that are not 'typical' and which maybe classed as obsessions. 
You say she never has friends of her own age.  It is quite typical for those on the spectrum to seek company with either younger children or older adults.  This is because younger children don't question and will go along with an older child, so they are really choosing a peer group that they can socialise with.  If they prefer adults it is because adults have patience to listen to them and their interests whereas their peers don't have these skills yet.
What was your daughter's speech development like as a toddler.  Did she acquire langugae as other children.  What is her ability to communicate and also understand what is said to her.  Does she take language literally.  Does she understand humour and sarcasm.  Her speech and social communication skills should be assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist and again, one that has experience of Aspergers.
From your post it sounds like your daughter is quite high functioning.  But she is obviously having alot of difficulties and with some input from professionals she could become much more able to socialise, because she needs to be taught all these skills.  She won't learn them by watching other people.  It won't make sense to her.
The emotional side of it, is simply that she doesn't understand many situations and maybe the implications of language.  She maybe getting totally overwhelmed by incoming sensory stimulus.  She may also have big problems with changes in routine, or unpredictable outcomes or changes to things she expected to happen.

        The reason you feel she is getting worse is because she hasn't reached some foundation learning blocks.  That has a knock on effect on higher abilities, rather like a pyramid effect.  
I would suggest that she is also assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist because although she developed speech you are saying that she may have problems processing the meaning of language and that she also doesn't understand some types of humour.  This is typical of Semantic Pragmatic Disorder which can accompany high functioning autism or aspergers.
The Sensory differences need to be assessed by an Occupational Therapist who has experience of Sensory Integration Disorder and autism/aspergers.
Having a diagnosis of autism or aspergers doesn't automatically mean that they have to have medication.  If your daughter is in a school that understands her diagnosis and supports her in her areas of difficulties then she won't be so stressed or anxious at school.  If environmental changes are also made so that the classroom (and home, and outings) are planning to be low sensory stimulation then she should be able to tolerate and function at a much better level.
But it is important that your daughter is assessed and receives help in acquiring skills that won't come naturally to her.  She needs to learn how to recognise her emotional state and how to calm herself down.  The 'tantrums' she has now are classic of aspergers and remain for life.  So she needs to learn how to monitor herself as she becomes an adult.
It is hard to get any kind of diagnosis.  But if your daughter has aspergers, she has it regardless of whether someone diagnosis it or not.  If she is not supported the situation is not going to resolve itself.  She will need therapies and support, and may need support throughout her adult life.  This is not because of low IQ, which can be normal, advanced or gifted.  It is because, for them, it is as if the 'rule book of life and social interaction' was never handed out to them.

        Does the Samaritan Behavioural Health centre have experience of diagnosing autism or aspergers?  If they don't then they may not recognise it.  You need a group of professionals to assess her who have experience of diagnosing aspergers because they will have a much clearer idea of whether she does or doesn't have it.

        Sally, you have been so helpful in your post. And I am taking my daughter tomarrow to meet a team of doctors who work with these disorders and are familiar with all my concerns. There are 5 doctors who will be evaluating her. And yes her school tries very hard to meet her needs and stay in daily contact with me. The school therapist sees her daily also, which has been very helpful getting her through her school day. Two of these doctors work with Autism, another with sensory. So, I feel very confident about the evaluation. They are seeing her at a hospital that works with only children with disorders. Again, thank you so much for your support and post. I will post again after we meet her doctors.

        I recommend that you have your daughter seen by a professional who specializes in diagnosing autism and related disorders. Your pediatrician should be able to identify a local professional. As you may know, autism is characterized by deficits in social and language development as well as the presence of repetitive behavior/restricted interests. Whether or not your child fits this diagnostic category, I recommend that you work with local professionals to intervene as early as possible to improve her language and social behavior and decrease tantrums.

1225,does my daughter have autism,"
        As she might be showing some signs of Sensory Difficulties I would also suggest you google Sensory Integration Disorder to see if that sounds relevant.  Sensory Differences can be experienced by those on the autistic spectrum.
I would also suggest googling the name Olga Bogdashina and reading an article by her in Autism Today.  She has a book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers which is very useful as it has a caregivers questionnaire at the back of the book that you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.  Our Autism Outreach Department uses this questionnaire, and we have had Olga come and give seminars to us.
I found that this book explained alot of my own son's behaviours and helped me see how I could change his environment and provide supports so that sensory issues did not cause him so many difficulties.
Typical sensory problems are appearing to be deaf, or covering their ears, or getting upset at sudden unpredictable noises eg. telephone ringing, vaccum cleaner.  Problems with touch as slight touch may hurt, or appearing not to feel pain, difficulties with clothes or socks and shoes, having to remove clothes tags, problems with brushing/cutting hair or cutting nails, problems with food tastes and textures as well as smells, problems with balance or co-ordination.  
A child can have difficulties in one sense or all of them, and it can fluctuate day to day or throughout the day.  So a child may appear deaf, cover their ears, then be seeking noise by banging things all in the same day!
You can also google DSM IV for autism and see what the clinical criteria is for diagnosing autism is.  
Your daughter is very young, so if she is assessed and needs therapies then it is more likely to have a positive effect.

Clumsiness is not among the diagnostic criteria for Asperger's Disorder. A diagnoses is made on the basis of social deficits and restricted/repetive behavior patterns. There are many children who do not meet the criteria for an Asperger's Disorder who do display some characterisitcs of this Disorder. Certainly, among developmentally typical individuals there are some folks who are more socially skilled than others. I am glad to hear that you have scheduled an appointment with a phsysician. I recommend that you share your concerns regarding you son's development with his doctor and with his school. Whether or not a diagnosis is assigned, it will be important to work on your son's social skills. Your school and pediatrician should be able to recommend some strategies or resources for social skills development.

1227,Are there other related social interaction disorders that are not quite as severe as even mild Asperger's?,"
        autism, including aspergers is on a spectrum.  So at one end you have typical 'normal' children and at the other you might have severely autistic children.  Somewhere within that range will be those with autism, autistic spectrum disorders, aspergers, traits of autism or aspergers etc.  It is quite possible to have traits, but not enough of them to get a diagnosis.  Also, as the diagnosis relies on having enough of the behaviours to get a diagnosis there are some children who are too able in one area to get a diagnosis.  
For example my son is diagnosed as being High Functioning Autistic.  He doesn't have any rigid routines or rituals and he doesn't have any obsessions.  If he does develop obsessions or restricted areas of interest then his diagnosis may change to Aspergers.  So it is a much more fluid thing rather than a concrete yes/no.
I think you need to raise your concerns and have your son assessed because even if he doesn't receive a diagnosis of aspergers it sounds like he may need some help with social skills.

        The situation you describe is certainly concerning.  Vomitting when faced with difficult situations is not uncommon with any child but probably occurs more often in children with developmental issues (ASD and other disorders).  You mention several scenarios in which it is quite possible that your son is having this behavior when faced with something he would rather not do.  This response might effectively remove him from something he finds unpleasant (challenging demands at school, a new judo class).  There are a number of potential effective interventions that have been shown to be effective for behavior that serves this function.  However, it would be important to conduct a functional behavioral assessment to be more certain.  I suggest that you contact a certified behavior analyst to help conduct an assessment and implement a functionally appropriate intervention.  Certified behavior analysts in your area can be found by logging on to www.bacb.com, click into the consumer information section and search for a Board Certified Behavior Analyst in your area.

Best of luck.

1229,ads and school phobia,"
        As you know, having a diagnosis of ASD means that your child will find any changes to routine or changes in surroundings/environment or expectations will cause him alot of stress.  My son when younger used to vomit if I turned the TV off, or took a toy off him, or took him out of the house etc etc.  He is much better now (he's 7).  But I suspect that firstly, your son is at a new school.  He is at an age when children are expected to be much more independent, and maybe he needs the supports and structures for longer, or for them to be withdrawn more gradually.
It is also worth considering anything before you tell him.  So having to move into another group is bound to be very stressful for him.  So it needs to be thought about and planned before it is even mentioned to him.  So a gradual cross over might be easier to achieve as well as talking to him about growing up and how people need to move into groups of a similar ability as they get better at something.  Use Social Stories etc.  He may find transitions very stressful and probably the vomiting is related to the 'fight or flight' reflex showing that he is in an high state of anxious arousal. 
As he is also verbal talk to him about his fears and take things a step at a time.  By taking small steps he will reach the same goal.  It doesn't have to be an immediate change if that upsets him.
His behaviour is a true reflection of his level of stress so just go with that.  Lower the expectations and slow down any transitions with step by step changes that are fully discussed and understood before they happen.
I know it is hard when you have other children.  Maybe you could involve them in the process as they will probably have a greater insight into his difficulties being of the same age.

        Given that you have posted in the autism/asperger's forum, I assume that you are concerned that your son's symptoms are consistent with one of these diagnoses. Many of the difficulties that you mention (e.g., being disrespectful, being fixated on TV) are common even among typical children at the age of 10. However, many of the difficulties that you mention relate to your son's social interaction with his peers. I do recommend that you speak to your son's pediatrician and to his teachers regarding his difficulties with peer social interaction. As you may know, social deficits are characteristic of Asperger's. But, many children without Asperger's also encounter difficulties with peers. Of course, a diagnosis can only be assigned based on thorough, in-personal assessment. Whether or not your son's social difficulties are related to asperger's syndrome, you shoud work to get him some help so that he can be more socially successful.

        An accurate diagnosis can only be assigned based on a thorough in-person evaluation. So, I recommend that you seek out an evaluation be a qualified professional. It will be important to provide information based on your knowledge of your child and the information gathered by his school, but his teachers are not qualified to provide a diagnosis. In the meantime, you and your son's school have identified delays in a number of areas, and it you can be begin working on those even without an understanding of the underlying diagnosis. Clearly, your son needs some speech, special education, and physical therapy services. In many cases, it takes a strong parent advocate to obtain services at a level that will allow a child to make progress. In some cases, diagnosis can help to build a case for the need for services.

        This is just a shot in the dark, but someone on another post mentioned a condition called mitocondrial dysfunction that can have some characteristics of autism.  I believe this is a genetic problem, and you have already mentioned that he has had genetic testing.  But google it and see what you think.
It might be that your son has developmental delay, along with another disorder or parts of another disorder.  It is quite possible to have traits of autism, but not enough of them to get a full diagnosis.  
And you need someone to get to the bottom of the speaking and socialising difficulties.  Does he have speech difficulties that make it hard for him to communicate, or even if he could communicate would he still have communication and social interaction difficulties that would still mean he was on the autistic spectrum.
But it also sounds like you have some other stuff going on as well, especially the problems with his urine and stools.

        I recommend that you seek the assistance of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst. I list of qualified professionals is available at the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (bacb.com). There are several highly effective behavioral interventions for aggressive behavior, and it is extremely important that you address this problem while your child is still young and physically easy to manage. It is also important to continue to expand her appropriate forms of communication. Often, children become aggressive to communicate that they want something (e.g., parental attention, a favorite activity) or to indicate that they don't want to do something (e.g., brush teeth). If your child can communicate appropriately for these things she will be less inclined to become aggressive.

1236,Aggression/rage episodes,"
        The only thing I would add to what has already been advised is that her behaviour, although inappropriate, is an indication of the level of emotion she is feeling.  My son is on the spectrum and is verbal.  Through talking with him he has explained to me that when something upsets or angers him he gets totally flooded and overwhelmed with those feelings.  So his emotional reaction is out of proportion to the incident (in our point of view), and he cannot stop it or bring it under control.  I went to a seminar where they explained this by saying to imagine a shower curtain around a bath.  When we experience emotional activity the water (emotional feelings), are restrained and contained by the shower curtain.  In autistic individuals they think this restriction is weaker with no shower curtain, so the water goes all over the place.  This means that greater parts of their brains are flooded with activity and they cannot stop it or bring it quickly under control.
So your daughter does need professionals who will help her monitor her emotions and learn to express them appropriately.  Also any improvements in communication as well as a highly structured and low sensory environment are going to bring huge improvements.  But in general these tantrums and emotional outbursts remain even in adulthood.

        You are describing a form of repetitive behavior (sometimes called stereotypy) that is common among children with autism spectrum disorders. But, a number of studies have also pointed out that some repetitive behavior also occurs in typically developing a children and typical adults. Therefore, I don't think this behavior is necessarily cause for concern. From your description, it sounds like your son has typical social behavior and language, which are the remaining characteristics of autism. Having said that, your son might get some negative reactions from peers if he behaves this way in front of them. I think it would be useful to make him aware of this behavior in a gentle way and to suggest some alternative ways to relieve boredom and express excitement. The exact approach would depend on the age of your child.

        I wanted to add that our daughter does many things above her age level.  She is 3 years and 2 months old, approximately.  Her verbal ability is more like someone who is not yet 2.  Her self-help skills are also in that age level as well (she is just learning how to feed herself, for example).  And although she doesn't speak much, she's learning how to read, does 40 piece puzzles, and problem solves more like a 4 or 5 year old would.  She also has an amazing sense of humor that astounds her doctors.  Is her brain just developing at different rates and the other things will catch up?  Though, I suppose the adherence to rituals, difficulty transitioning between activities, and sensory issues may not go away?

1239,Autism and social communication,"
        I know you've posted for an expert, but I wanted to tell you that for a long time I was thinking along the same lines as yourself.  BUT, after a couple of years, I am now aware that eventhough my son is very capable at some things in certain situations, his abilities are not generalised across the whole of his development and in many situations he is unable to give a 'normal' response.  
It may become more evident as your daughter gets older as to what her social strengths and weaknesses are.  That is the hard part to get to grips with.  It isn't that an autistic child 'can't' or 'doesn't' want to socialise.  It is that they will again show a 'spiky profile'.  So they may socialise brilliantly with some people, in some environments or situations - but be totally unable to socialise, or appear disinterested in other environments or with other people.  So a child with Aspergers may be able to socialise by talking to someone about his interests, but although that is socialising that child does not have an 'appropriate' way of interacting.  He is talking at the other person with no understanding or interest of whether the other person is even interested in what he is saying.  And he may also not be interested in what the other person wants to say to him, so the conversation can be very one sided.
Their need to socialise seems to be driven only by 'what they are getting out of it'.  It is very egocentric.  They don't socialise for the sake of it.  They aren't interested in (or aware of) the social do's and don'ts.  
They also have poor 'theory of mind', which plays a big part on how they interact.
Having a spiky profile means that certain skills will develop and may develop way ahead of her peers.  But these skills seem to be good because they are associated with their interests and therefore they are motivated to do them and improve these skills.  But they can totally neglect other areas of development because there isn't the motivation or the ability there.  
My son can tease me, and trick me.  He can lie convincingly.  He can blame his sister for something he has done.  Alot of it he has seen on TV, but he is beginning to use that learnt information and manipulate it into a new/different event, which is very encouraging.  But no matter how good he gets, I still don't think he will be off the spectrum because there are other skills that he simply cannot do.  
Does any of that make any sense?

1240,whats next?,"
        This is obviously a complex and challenging situation and you asked a number of questions.  Masturbation is not entirely uncommon in children around your son’s age.  If it occurs in private and is not interfering in other aspects of your son’s life, I would not be overly concerned about it.  It also sounds like your son was placed in a science class that you do not believe is appropriate for him and that he seems to have problem behavior most often in this class.  I would recommend speaking with the school administration about this.  It is very important that your son be placed in educational environments that are appropriate for him, this is clearly a possible source for the problem behavior and attitude that he is having.  That being said, it is certainly possible to address his problem behavior and the way that he speaks to you directly.  I recommend seeking out a behavior therapist who has experience working with children similar to your son.  Typical sorts of programs that have been shown to be effective often involve some sort of contingency contracting in which you and your son identify some of his favorite activities, perhaps some special event that he might be able to do weekly (e.g., a movie), identify a goal for his behavior (e.g., no shoving at school for a week or no name calling for a certain period of time), and then a way to monitor his progress.  This is something that he should be involved in, ideally he would be able to earn something that he is excited about for following through.  As for the antidepressants and mood stabilizers, these medications are also not uncommonly prescribed for individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.  However, they carry side effects and should be taken seriously.  You should understand exactly why they are being prescribed, what the side effects are, and you should also be convinced that they are working the way that they are intended to.  You should be meeting with the psychiatrist regularly to discuss the medication and its effects.

1241,whats next?,"
        Although alot of children with Aspergers tend to acquire speech, they do tend to have problems with social interactions and don't automatically know what behaviour is appropriate and how to behave to different people in different situations.  In the UK it would be the Speech and Language Therapist who would look at this and put together a programme.  For example some children may not know how to end a conversation and therefore may say what they want to say, and then walk away leaving the other person confused and angry at their rude behaviour.  
So, first, I would say don't assume he is being rude to you or anyone.  Assume he doesn't know how to behave appropriately.  
Or he may have learnt his social behaviour from things he has seen on TV or films.  
My son is high functioning autistic and he certainly takes alot of his social cues and language from TV and films.  
What kind of school does your son attend.  If it is one that has experience and expertise in autism then they should have some sort of Social Skills group where they work on these skills.
The school learning environment is very important to those on the spectrum because they tend to have alot of sensory problems and so noises, smells, visual things can be a distraction and all this incoming sensory information can overwhelm them.  
The school might have been trying to introduce him to the Science lesson because it is an area that he does well in.  But it maybe that something about that class, or the level of support your son receives that is causing him problems which he will undoubtedly bring home.
If he is self aware, as my son is, then he may be becoming very negative because he can see that he is not at the same level as his peers.  He can see that he is continually failing and is not able to do what the other children can.  This is largely down to the school.  Either the school is not particularly good at meeting the needs of those on the spectrum, or they are not supporting him sufficiently or giving him achieveable targets.  Have you discussed his diagnosis with him?  Does he understand he has Aspergers and he isn't stupid or bad.  No-one likes to fail.  If we were in a job where we continually got things wrong and didn't understand what we should be doing or why and everyone seemed to think we were rude or stupid and that happened day after day, then we too would behave in a negative, rude, disruptive way.
My son is also dyslexic and has dyscalculia as well.  He is also very self aware and assessed as being above 75% on a cognitive ability scale as long as it doesn't involve verbal instructions.  It is hard to challenge academically them whilst also meeting their very specific needs.
I am a very firm believer that there is a 'reason' for any behaviour.  As he is verbal try asking him what he likes/dislikes about school.  Ask him if he is happy there.  Ask him if he has any friends, or would like to have friends etc etc.  But make sure you do this when he is calm and not when he is upset.  You might get some very open and honest answers.

        Part 1 of 2 (see my next entry for part 2)

First let me start by addressing Jenny McCarthy and the GFCF diet.

Former MTV personality and model Jenny McCarthy published two books and has appeared on numerous television shows, promoting the notion that autism is caused by vaccines.  She claims that vaccines caused her son’s autism and also claims that her son has been cured via chelation, diets, antifungal medication, and various other unsubstantiated therapies.  McCarthy also writes in her first book that she “chain smoked” throughout her pregnancy prior to deciding to live a healthier life after her son was born.  Smoking during pregnancy has been well documented as being associated with a higher prevalence of autism and other psychiatric symptoms (e.g., Rizwan et al., 2007).  If there is a known mechanism, in this case smoking, for some environmental ""trigger"" to autism, it is not necessary (and perhaps self-serving) to suggest an unfounded mechanism such as vaccines.

NECC has closely followed the autism-vaccine hypotheses and research related to it.  As we have reported in the past, the findings of many large scale studies show no link between autism and either thimerosal in vaccines or the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.  (Previous coverage in our Research Newsletter can be accessed at the first link below).  In fact, the September 27th 2007 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine contains a study that “does not support a causal association between early exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing and immune globins and deficits in neuropsychological functioning…” (This study can be accessed at the second link below.) Despite the accumulating evidence against the link between vaccines and autism, it is likely that people will continue to ignore this scientific evidence in favor of a belief that a link exists. 

Dietary interventions for developmental and learning disabilities have been controversial for decades.  When a child presents with a metabolic disorder, it often follows that diet may be a critically important variable.  Certain metabolic disorders, like phenylketonuria, are effectively managed by diet.  Many different diets have been suggested as treatment for autism as well as for various other developmental disabilities and diseases.  However, unless a child has a food allergy/intolerance or a verifiable metabolic condition it is unlikely that dietary changes will affect their disability at all. Currently (I'm confident a new, equally unfounded diet will emerge at some point in the future), the most popular diet promoted as a cure for autism involves restricting casein and gluten from the child’s diet.  The unfounded assumption behind recommending that casein and gluten be restricted is that the processing of these substances causes many of the symptoms of autism.  Beside the fact that most of the evidence provided as support for casein/gluten theory of autism comes from individuals involved in selling these products or diet-related advice, the lack of scientific acceptance of casein and gluten processing difficulties as a cause of autism is one good reason to be wary of this approach.

Though children with ASD seem no more likely to have irritable bowel-like gastrointestinal difficulties or food allergies than typically developing children, the fact is that both children with ASD and those who are typically developing can have this problem.  It is also the case that children are more likely to have food allergies than adults.  So food allergies are clearly an appropriate concern.  In fact, at times they can involve severe reactions that are life threatening. Shortly after the food the child has an allergy to is ingested, symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, tingling/swelling in the mouth area, difficulty breathing, pronounced rashes especially on the face or torso) appear.  Most children (including many children I've worked with and my daughter) outgrow their allergies although it is thought that allergies to tree nuts (and peanuts), fish, and shellfish are likely life-long allergies.

For nearly two decades I have worked with children with feeding difficulties with and without ASDs and one frequently encountered cause of a child’s feeding problem is food allergy.  If a child has a documented food allergy then removing the allergen(s) from the child’s diet is one necessary component of resolving the problem.  However, determining that the child has a food allergy is a critical first step.  If a child is suspected of having an allergy because of symptoms, then there are two tests commonly accepted as valid means of diagnosing food allergy.  These are the skin ***** and RAST (radioallergosorbent) tests.  If the child does not show signs of allergy noted above or through these two tests, diet is not going to affect their behavior in the slightest.

So, why not restrict access to casein and gluten just to make sure you are doing everything you can for your child?  First and foremost is the lack of scientific evidence that casein and gluten cause autism is concerning and the lack of evidence that GFCF diets have any impact on symptoms of autism.  Blinded studies of dietary intervention suggest no benefit from the GFCF diet (and more clinical trials are due to end in the near future).  Another reason to not restrict the diet of a child with an ASD is the fact that children with ASD are prone to selective eating (Ahearn et al., 2001).   During our study of the eating habits of children with an ASD, my colleagues and I provided children with a variety of foods across six meals spread out over at least two weeks.  Over half of the children we observed presented with some form of selective eating.  Though we saw selectivity for various food groups, the food group that our selective eaters were most likely to prefer was starch (also the food group typically developing children are most likely to selectively accept).  Gluten is a constituent of many starches and restricting access to this substance can lead to eliminating the only foods that a child regularly eats.  

The course of action that I have followed as a clinician treating selective eating has been to attempt to expand the variety of foods a child eats.  I’ve worked with children who ate only one food and would not eat unless that food was prepared in a specific manner (e.g., macaroni and cheese made with whole milk and butter served straight out of the pan).  Going from such selective acceptance of food to eating other foods often takes quite a long time.  The only situations in which I would recommend restricting access to food would be if the child had a documented food allergy or excessively consumed food.  Several parents have reported to me that they have tried the GFCF diet and their child would not eat any of the foods presented to them.  To be fair, I’ve also had a number of parents swear to me that this diet was very helpful but none of them answered yes when I asked them if the diet cured their child of autism.  It is my opinion that children with an ASD will not benefit from dietary restrictions of any kind unless they also have a food allergy or intolerance.  Furthermore, children who are selective eaters are likely to become more selective and may stop eating when their diet is radically restricted.   Because children with ASDs are prone to selective eating it is probably a good idea to attempt to expand their diets rather than restrict them.

        Have you looked at the possibility of tourettes?  I know that it can involve noises as well as physical ticks.  And I think that touretts can also be on a spectrum from mild to severe.  If that is the cause then you may need to be approaching it from a different perspective.  Has he been referred to a specialist that deals with tourettes?  I don't think he would be doing it 'to annoy' anyone.  Being compelled to make noises is going to make him stand out in the crowd, and as you know most children on the spectrum don't like being in the spotlight.
And the professional who suggested he was trying to 'annoy' you obviously had no understanding of autism at all.
There is always a 'reason' for the behaviour whether it is obvious to us or not.

        Part 2 of 2

On the matter of the vocal tick, I would start by looking for other opinions on the nature of this problem.  It is possible that this behavior is not a tick as much as it is a vocal form of stereotypy.  On the other hand, there may be post-nasal drip that your son is responding to and the throat-clearing/scratching might be an appropriate response.  I would ask your pediatrician to help you rule out that there is significant post-nasal congestion or to seek an appropriate course of medical intervention (risperidol, abilify, etc. are not tailored to treat post-nasal drip). They would probably be able to help you determine this without the need for a specialist.  If this behavior is truly a tick there are many courses of possible courses of action that do not involve medication. One treatment is referred to as habit reversal and a qualified behavior analyst might be the best person to direct this type of intervention.  Finally, if this behavior is vocal stereotypy, there are many interventions (for example, response blocking and redirection, self-management, differential reinforcement of alternative responding) that have been found to be effective for treating stereotypy and a qualified behavior analyst would also likely be the best person to direct intervention.  To find a qualified behavior analyst in your area, go the www.bacb.com and click on the consumer information link.  There is a certificant registry that allows one to search by city, state or zip code.

Best of luck.

        I recommend that you have your son participate in a developmental screening as soon as possible. From your description, it sounds as though your son is experiencing a language delay. Early intervention for any developmental delay is critically important, so you will want to get your son evaluated soon. Be sure that any evaluation results in recommendations for how to interact with you son in a way that will help encourage his language.

        I do recommend that you schedule an in-person assessment with a qualified professional. It is critical to intervene early with autism and any other developmental delay. Currently, there are no medications that have been shown effective in treating the characteristics of autism. So, I would be very skeptical of any professional who would recommend medication as a first step in the treatment of autism.

1250,I think My 5 year old has a form of Autism,"
        You don't have to agree to anything you are not happy with and that includes medications.
If you have concerns about autism you can ask your paediatrician for an evaluation by a multi disciplinary team that specialises in diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  You might also want to consider asking or getting an assessment from an Occupational therapist because his behaviour around being touched may be down to a tactile sensory issue and if one sense if out, then the chances are that others are also.  
He is over or under sensitive to light or bright objects, noise, smell, touch, taste, appears clumsy or unco-ordinated?

1252,Developmental Disorder,"
        If you have any concerns about your son's development I would first ask the special educators in your school and your pediatrician. Repetitive behavior are characteristic of autism but are not the only red flags. If you are still concerned I would suggest that you go try to identify a hospital in an urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children who present developmental delays. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations. You can then take these recommendations to your local public school. Usually insurance will pay for a hospital evaluation.

My son makes good eye-contact, communicates failry well, follows instructions very well, friendly with everybody in general, akward with peers, lot better with older and younger children. Most think he is ""shy"". Does not really have any repetitive behaviors (other than jumping and sometimes singing a bit too much:) Always wants somebody to play with - hates playing alone. Has trouble with transitions and impulse control. Gets fixated on things and not always understands /accepts the fact that he cannot have something. Very affectionate. Has excellent memory and extensive vocabulary. Not doing so well on reciprocal speech, doing very weel with expressive speech. Draws better that many ""neuro - typical peers"", but fails to perform. Sings in perfect tune. Has great sense of humor. All that said, he was diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS. Schools district assigned him to ""developmental delay"" category, mostly due to to his problems with transitions/attention/not ability to answer some of the test questions. He got difficult ones, while missed very easy ones (did not capture his attention). They are inclined to rule out Autism because he has so much social interaction and lots of imaginative play (not just re-enacting something he saw - he can be pretty spontaneous). Autism Spectrum is indefenitely broad. My son really does not have an official ""diagnosis"", but receives lots of support, and doing much better in school now:)

Getting evaluated will not hurt for sure

Good luck

1255,How to reduce voice volume?,"
        The purpose of your daughter's communication is to get your attenton or to get something else that she wants. If the whole family requires appropriate voice volume for either of those things, I would expect that her volume will decrease very quickly. Tell her once that you will only respond if she uses her ""inside voice"" (or whatever phrase you typically use). Then quickly respond when she follows this rule, but ignore yelling. At first, you can expect that she will yell louder and perhaps protest in other ways. But, as soon as she learns that won't work, I would expect her to adjust her volume.

        You son's pediatrician should be able to provide guidance about any medical issues related to this problem.

You should remind your son whenever you are in public with a quiet statement or by gently guiding hes hands away. If necessary give him something appropriate to hold (e.g,. a small toy) to keep his hands occupied.

It is important for you to know that there are effective behavioral interventions for each of the problems that you described. These can be hard work for families to implement. But, you do not need to live with the behavior that you described. You might consider contacting a Board Certified Behavior Analyst in your area (see www.bacb.com for a list of certificants) to request some recommendations.

1261,ASD or mood regulation disorder,"
        Hi, I am a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum.
It is quite possible for a child to be on the spectrum and do well in school academically as well as things like arts.  Although he is very good with things like reading do you think he has a full understanding of what he reads the the story and what the implications of things happening within the story mean?  Can he predict outcomes etc.
Motivation is very hard with children on the spectrum because they don't have the same social rules as we do.  They do not want to perform to get approval from parents or teachers.  They don't care what everyone else is doing, they just want to do what they want to do!  Usually motivating them requires a 'first this and and then that' approach, where they would read first and then do something they have chosen as a reward eg. play with lego for 15 minutes etc.
Problems with social interaction are typical.  Not knowing how to make or keep friends.  Wanting to play, but not knowing how to start or sustain it.  Some imaginative play can be seen with some higher functioning children, but there can also be rigidity and repeitive ways of wanting to play where the child might want complete control of the game and would want other children to re-enact something they have seen on TV or to only do or say what the child with ASD has decided is the storyline etc.
If he takes words/phrases from TV or DVDs or films and interweaves them into his speech that is delayed echolalia.  This demonstrates a language processing difficulty, but also shows alot of intelligence to be able to put those phrases into his speech rather like putting a puzzle together.
Does your son have normal voice volume, intonation and pitch.  Does he speak with an accent or a monotone voice?
Those things you mention I would recognise in my own son.  So I'm not sure why the special ed teacher does not recognise these things as being on the spectrum.  If your son is at the milder end of the spectrum he will be very capable in some areas, and then be unable to do other things we might consider quite easy.
Anxiety is very typical of being on the autistic spectrum.  The more structure, routine and predictable outcomes there are the less the anxiety and stress.  He maybe showing alot of stress at school because they are not making his daily timetable and work highly structured because they think he is too able.  But the anxiety would indicate that he does infact need the structure.
I think that whether he had a diagnosis of autism, aspergers or PDD NOS the approaches they use are the same.  Anxiety is also very high in these disorders and the more his school and teachers understand that the better.  Does his current school have any other children on the spectrum and do they have experience and expertise in autism?
Sometimes it does take a while to see how your child is developing and where the difficulties are more obvious.  He is 4.5 now.  If he is having difficulties with social interaction then he really needs a Speech and Language Therapist to be putting together a social communication programme for him.  He needs to be taught how to make and keep friends.  He needs an adult to be supporting and modeling behaviour for him during break times.  He needs to learn appropriate language.  He needs supports such as lunchtime clubs and 'circle of friends' etc.  He needs to be taught how to share and take turns.  If he is doing well academically his school may not recognise the difficulties he is having in these areas, but he won't learn these skills himself.

1262,ASD or mood regulation disorder,"
        My post was so long, I put it in two parts!

We have just completed my son's IEP.  He is 7.5 years and is at a mainstream school which has alot of experience of autism and also has an autism unit.
My son is verbal, but tends not to initiate conversations or ask for help etc.  On his IEP they have set targets whereby he has been given some picture symbols that he has been taught how to use.  The teaching staff are going to set up situations where he will need to ask for help to make sure that he is able to either ask for it verbally or use the card to request help.  Once they are sure he can do this to one nominated adult, they will generalise that learnt skill to other adults so that he can ask help of any teacher or adult within the school.  
They are going to help him to learn to initiate social interaction by sending him at least twice a day to give a simple message to another teacher, or they may send him to another teacher to ask them a simple question such as 'what is your name'.  
Later on they will need to teach him how to hold a two way conversation.  How to understand if the person you are talking to is interested in what you are saying.  How to listen to someone else even if you think what they are saying is boring.  How to take turns in conversation etc.
These are all very basic skills that children pick up very early in life.  But if your child does not have them, he has to be taught them.  Does that make sense?

        Thank you for your input

We do have social skills, initiating and sustaining play, joining play, and 3-4 conversation exchanges, and even using right verb tenses etc. goals written in his IEP
They work ""social chat"" training into their snack time - they are passing the juice, crackers etc. They have visual timers, picture systems, visuals, schedules, ""first-then"" boards,everything you can think of. They use discrete trial and other behavior management techniques. They pretty much have everything I was looking for. 
Teachers appear very knowlegeable.....

He does not have any trouble asking for help - we taught him that by putting all of his toys up where he cannot reach them and he has to ask us to retreive an item every time (although he is very impatient at times - I try to make him wait a bit longer). He finally understands waiting in line and taking turn concepts.
 He shares ok (well - better that some NT children who came to his B-day party), although sometimes gets very fixated on certain toy and then sharing is a problem. He has no rigid rituals, only sensory things and picky eating. He answers ""when""and ""where""questions most of the time, and can predict outcome in stories when I read to him, it is a lot harder for him to do at school during circle time
The area he has the biggest trouble with - telling me about his day at school (unless something extraordinary happened, like he managed to **** off a boy who usually bullies him, or they had some quests coming in, or if he was particulary pleased with what I have packed him for lunch). He also engages in avoidance behaviours in his special ed class - but it is getting better.....

Long story short - he will need to be taught those skills indeed, I would like to start some supplemental support for him (other than school), but not sure whether I should use behavior management systems or rather things specific to ASD......We had a funny thing with visuals - where we were teaching him to ask for something when he was little (3 y.o) - visual was ""I WANT""card - anyway, I was asking him to do something and did not look at him - he pulled the card out and got with it in my face:) I am not big on eye contact either - it is a cultural thing:) 
Well - anyway, we get IEP report card tomorrow (and they did set metrics that they will be able to quantify) - so goals are measurable:)

        About tone of voice - he speaks in a normal pitch, and there is nothing monotonous about his speech (maybe a little bit the other way - very theatrical and dramatic)

1265,ASD or mood regulation disorder,"
        From all you have posted it sounds to me like he is on the spectrum.  Of course he will develop, learn skills and improve.  There is always the possibility that a child can improve enough to lose a diagnosis.  But remember that losing a diagnosis usually means losing supports.
It sounds like your son is getting the right kind of supports, because they do use similar programmes for children on the spectrum, with social communications problems, semantic pragmatic disorder, ADD/ADHD etc.
As he grows up you will begin to notice where his difficulties lie at any one time.  For example he may struggle with a certain social communication skills or the whole of the year (or years).  Then he will suddenly master it and you will move onto the next most obvious difficulty he has.
Just try to work with what is happening at the moment.  For example if he has no interest in other children there is no point pushing that.  But as soon as he begins to show an interest then you can start working in that area.  You just have to wait for the windows of opportunity.
He sounds like he may be very good and precise with language, which is good from an academic point of view.  But his expressive understanding may be greater than his receptive understanding.
During things like circle time at school, there may just be too much sensory information coming in for him to focus.  It is easier on a one to one basis.  In a group there will be any number of sounds and sound sources, smells, visual distractions, auditory information, touch and close proximity of other children etc and it may just be too much for him.
In situations like that (school assembly) my son wears ear defenders, which he will ask for himself.  He also has Irlen symdrome and wears the tinted lenses for that which help reduce visual over stimulation.  It can sometimes help to give them something to fiddle with ie. a small piece of theraputty.  He may need any carpet time instructions repeated to him one to one by a teaching assistant to make sure he has heard and understood what he is supposed to be doing.

        I recommend that you have your son assessed by a professional with experience diagnosing asperger's syndrome. Of course, an in-person assessment by a qualified professional is necessary to provide a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Your pediatrician should be able to provide some suggestions regarding bedwetting and urinary accidents. It is important to rule out medical reasons for these problems. But, because your son does not have accidents at school, a medical problem is less likely. In your post, you identify situations in which your son has difficulties (e.g., accidents at home, hurtful statements towards you) and those in which he does not (e.g., no accidents at school, no hurtful statements toward others). This is an important approach to considering how to improve his behavior. First, it is clear that these behaviors are not ""uncontrollable,"" because they occur only in some conditions.

Please discuss these difficulties and engage in problem solving with a local pediatrician or psychologist who can help to guide you toward some solutions.

        I would recommend that you have your child participate in a developmental screening as soon as possible. Your pediatrician should be able to inform you regarding the best local resources. Please be sure to have your child's skills assessed. And, whether or not she receives a diagnosis or qualifies for any services, be sure to get some suggestions for how language development can be encouraged at daycare and in the home. I agree with your daycare provider that children can ""catch up."" But, this is not something they do on their own -- they need the help of caregivers to encourage developmental progress.

        If you go into the autism forum, click on the Health page icon on the top right hand corner of that page.  Then have a look at ""Behavioural Characteristics behind the Clinical Diagnosis of autism (ASDs)"".  I have posted in there the DSM IV clinical criteria for a diagnosis of autism (and at the bottom I have also put the criteria for Aspergers).  This lists the behaviours that professionals will be looking for when they observe a child.  Parents have also posted examples of their child's behaviour that met the criteria to help give practical examples of behaviours that fit the criteria.
As you will see there are a list of possible behaviours and any child only has to get a number of them in any category, for example 2 out of 6.  But there are three sections and a child has to get a certain amount of behaviours from each category to get a diagnosis.  A child who failed to have any behaviours in one of the sections might get a diagnosis of something like PDD NOS.
It is very important that a child is observed by a multi disciplinary team that has experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  Typically that might entail a paediatrician, clinical/educational pyschologist, occupational therapist etc.
There are many 'autistic' behaviours that are 'normal' in children up to a certain age or to a certain extent.  
Things from your post that I would recognise as possibly being on the spectrum are:-
Academic difficulties.  Children with autism can find it hard to learn to read and write.  Those with Aspergers tend to do better academically.  My son for example is 7 and is still not reading independently.  He finds it hard to learn and apply phonics.  He can read a book once and memorise it giving the 'appearance' of being able to read.  But he cannot always recognise those same words in a different context.
Change is always a problem because one small change alters the 'whole' experience for them and makes it unrecognisable or very stressful for them.  In school they need alot of structure and routine with alot of visual supports to help them go through their work independently.
What is he like with other types of change such as having to take a toy off him because it is time to go out.  Or having to go shopping and you go a different route.  Or you tell him you are going to the supermarket but then remember you also have to get petrol or go to another shop.
Extremes in emotion are common.  They appear to 'overreact' and then cannot get their feelings under control for quite a while.  They are not being spoilt or mardy they really do get overwhelmed and flooded with emotion that they cannot bring under control.  They need structures in place to help them cope and help them learn about emotions and how they should handle their feelings.
What is his speech like.  Does he repeat back to you things you say or things he has heard on TV.
How does he interact socially with his age group.  In a group of his peers would he be in the middle of it or on the edges of the group or totally separated from them doing his own thing.
Does he have any sensory issues such as appearing deaf, covering his ears, complaining of being hurt when he has only been touched, appears clumsy or problems with co-ordination etc.

        I also wanted to add that he has some sensory issues as well(not diagnosed) he cries or screams when he hears loud noises like a hair dryer or a blender and often times a song of music on tv scares him. I have a hard time getting him to eat as well. He wont even try a food most of the time even if its something I know he likes. I know hes hungry though because he will eat cereal all day long if I let him.

Sensory issues are common in those on the spectrum.  If you google the name Olga Bogdashina you can read an article by her printed in Autism Today.  She also has a very good book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  At the back of the book is a questionnaire that you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.  The Autism Department in our city uses this questionnaire to get an idea of the sensory difficulties of the children.  So it is a reputable questionnaire.

1278,Speech delay&Gross motor delay=autism?,"
        My son also waves and shows affection and is on the spectrum.  The tantrums and frustration increases as they are expected to compy more with their environment.  So my son was okay at nursery, but totally freaked out at preschool at age 3+ because he still wanted to do as your son does, and stay on his own doing his own thing.  As soon as they tried to make him comply to 'join in' and do what everyone else was doing then he started with avoidance behaviours such as vomiting, banging his head on the wall, scratching at his face, hiding under the table etc etc.  He was not showing these behaviours at home.
He is now nearly 8 and is in a mainstream school that has experience and expertise in autism.  I moved him to this school in September this year and it has made all the difference having teaching staff who are trained and experienced in autism and who have a huger amount of experience dealing with lots of different children.  Because each child is different and they have to find out their strengths and weaknesses etc.
If you are concerned go to your doctor and ask for a referral to a multi disciplinary team that specialises in diagnosing autism.  The comment about waving and showing affection is not true when you consider there are people with Aspergers who are doctors, lawyers, married with kids, run their own businesses.  They must also have some level of social ability, empathy, theory of mind etc to have got to the level they are at.  That is why it is called a 'spectrum' disorder.

        Hi Worried Mom,

At 19 months, I saw my daughter going down the same road. Loss of vocabulary, lining things up, poor social skills etc... 8 weeks ago we started her on Nordic Naturals Fish Oil supplements and have seen a dramatic improvement. She started to babble, then say words and now she seems to be ""caught up"". Even in her evaluations, they cannot believe the change. Now, I am no expert, at all - but it almost seems like the oil is detoxing her system - maybe of metal or whatever - I don't know. But, it may be worth a try. There are huge improvements in language, eye contact, social skills and tantrums. Just a thought. Research it, take it with a grain of salt. I've read that it doesn't help all - but I can't help but have noticed the changes in my daughter.

Good Luck,

        We have all traveled down this same road.  My son was the same as you describe yours.  My son is now 5.5 years.  He is high functioning.  I tried using sign language to get through to my son and it worked.  We were able to communicate that way but alot of pictures helped too.  I did not allow him a comfy zone or use his diagnosis as an excuse for him to not ""use his words"".  We used pictures for drinks, food, bedtime, clean up time- things like that.  He still uses alot of sign language and they use this technique at his special ed too.  For my boy, sign language was alot easier for him to pick up and understand then the pictures.  I think, if you use pictures, use pictures of himself with a drink or food or in bed etc.  You can easily teach yourself sign language as you teach him by repitition.  Once you know he has learned it, make sure you demand his using it.
On a side note, Read Jenny McCarthy's book Louder than words!   It will help you alot. 

Just as B208 above has noted using fish oil.  I started using Cod Liver Oil recently and then had to leave my son for a couple days.  He had not been on this for even two solid weeks and I noticed a difference.  He has alot more cognative function- like now he can pretend and understand those kinds of games.

        Find a good child psych who does not resport to meds at a drop of a hat. Sounds that she does not get any behavioral support at school. Do they have behavior modification plan/program? Does she have IEP? Do they beleive that her behavior is the direct result of her condition? Do you live in the US? If your daughter has IEP and her behavior is the direct result of her Aspergers', they cannot expel, but rather to change IEP goals and write some behavior modification goals into it. 

Good luck and I agree with the previous poster that so many meds is SCARY

        It is very tough. My son now will not go to the bathroom at school, although that is not good, it is the best we have at the moment. The UnderJams Night Wear absorbent underwear work really well. They are designed to hold more then the standard pull up. There is another brand as well but I don't have the name available. I would not do this at home as if he is going to the washroom it is not good to get him off the path but for school and night time (night time training should be separate) it should be okay. You can rent the video's for the library as well. 'I can go potty', is a good one. If reinforcers work for you, you can try to set up a sticker, token or chocolate chip schedule for the good days as a treat for success. The only other thought I have is do you know if he has ever gone to the washroom at school? It is not uncommon for many children not wanting to go in a strange place and he is just to young to hold it. We have had no assitance with doctors, however it is good to speak to them to eliminate any medical challenges. I have looked into a behavioral therpist however they are very $$$$. Sorry I can't be of more help I know how difficult it is.

        I can partially relate - since he was 3 y.o, my son would not go by a public bathroom...It has improved by itself - although he never goes #2 at school (he went a couple of times on a road trip when he really could not hold it in). 
Anyway, as for behaviour therapist - behavior analysis is not a rocket science, just methods to teach skills by dissecting them into small pieces.....Try parenting support groups - there are a lot of people out there with similar problems

        Delayed echolalia and vocal stereotypy are not uncommon in children diagnosed with autism and, as you are experiencing, can pose a challenge in that they can interfere with learning.  This type of behavior, although in some cases communicative, is often a form of self stimulation.  As opposed to problem behavior that serves a communicative function, stereotypy of this type can be quite challenging to treat.  With communicative behavior, one of the most effective treatments is to teach the child an appropriate alternative method of gaining whatever is being sought through the problem behavior and not allow problem behavior to result in this same consequence.  Thus, the appropriate behavior works, the problem behavior doesn’t and the child learns to do what works.  In the case of vocal stereotypy and delayed echolalia, the stereotypy always works to produce the sound.  That being said, there are interventions that have been shown to reduce the likelihood of stereotypy.  They may involve the use of competing sources of stimulation (e.g., music) either noncontingently (in cases in which the child does not emit the stereotypy when preferred music is playing, for example) or contingent upon the child spending a certain amount of time without engaging in stereotypy.  Other common treatment procedures make use of overcorrection, thus prompting the child to say a few words each time he or she engages in stereotypy.  This is designed to make it a bit of an annoyance for the child to engage in stereotypy and also give the child some positive practice engaging in appropriate speech.  These sorts of procedures can be effective but should be overseen by a trained behavior analyst who has experience in treating this sort of behavior.

1288,a preschooler with autism who is always singing or babbling ,"
        Try googling echolalia and delayed echolalia in autism to see if that is relevent.  Alot of children on the spectrum repeat things they have heard.  It might be an immediate repetition of something you ask for say to your child eg. 'do you want a drink' might be repeated back to you by your child 'do you want a drink'.  But it can also be delayed repetition of things heard on TV/DVD/conversations at home or school/adverts/any kind of noise.
My son is verbal, but also uses alot of echolalia phrases put together like puzzle pieces to make up his speech.  He also uses the same accent as it is initially heard and although we are in the UK he speaks with an American accent.
An example of delayed echolalia is this: a teenage boy in class was asked by the teacher to concentrate and complete his work, to which he replied 'go to hell lieutenant'.  He was reprimanded for this, but when the teacher spoke with his parents she discovered that he had been watching a war film in which a soldier was told to do something he didn't want to do by his commander and that was the response the soldier gave 'go to hell lieutenant'.  What does this tell us?  That the child understood the emotional context of the phrase and used it in a similar situation.  Unfortunately the teacher had no understanding of the relevance of this phrase (or the fact that it had come from a film) and thought the child was being either silly or rude.  Infact he was being neither.  He was simply communicating using a phrase he had learnt that he thought was relevant to the situation.
For those whose communication difficulties are more severe they may use echolalic phrases, adverts, songs, jingles etc to 'take their turn' in conversation.  So you may ask your child a question.  They may not understand what you have said, or if they do they may not be able to formulate a response.  But they do understand that it is their turn to speak and so they repeat an echolalic phrase.  For example I asked my son 'was school good today', and he replied 'there's a hider in the house'.  I know that is a phrase from a children's TV programme he watches.  On other occasions he is perfectly okay to answer my questions using his own words.  
Some children/adults with autism find eye contact uncomfortable or even painful.  Others cannot look at you and also listen at the same time.  To get their attention repeat their name until they acknowledge that they have heard you then tell them what you want to say.  You don't need to make eye contact to convey the message and in many cases deliberatly not seeking eye contact and even turning your back on them or speaking to the wall means that they are able to hear what you are saying better because they don't have the additional visual distraction of having to look at you.
But, having said that, some children/adults are okay with eye contact, so you just have to see what works best.

        I am a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum, not a professional.  My advice would probably be to ask for an evaluation through observations and assessments by a multi disciplinary team through Health (ie. a referral from your GP or paediatrician).  I would specifically ask to be sent to a centre that has experience of diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  They should be in a better position to rule autism in or out as although there are similarities there are also subtle differences between the two diagnosis.
My only other comment is that children do tend to be very different at home as opposed to at school.  My son appears alot more 'autistic' in the classroom than he does at home.  But there can also be other children with Aspergers who appear to 'cope' well at school, but then let out all their anger and frustration at home.
There are also alot of similarities in behaviours between children with hearing or visual loss and autism.  That is why alot of professionals who deal with autistic children believe that in some way they are 'blind' or 'deaf' to their environment and social interactions.

        First, try to make the experience as pleasant as possible by buying a fun and soft toothbrush (as one mother suggested) and helping your child to select a toothpaste that he prefers. You might consider starting with a brand of training toothpaste that can be swallowed. This would make the task a bit less complicated. I also recommend setting your son up for success by requiring only very brief cooperation at first. Generally your starting point should be based on his typical level of cooperation. If he will typicall only tolerate 1 second of toothbrushing, you could start there. You could then gradually increase the duration of toothbrushing. Given that your child has never allowed you to brush his teeth, it seems reasonable to offer him some small reward if he cooperates. Your son is likely to make progress more quickly if you practice toothbrushing several times per day. This is only necessary until his full set of teeth is brushed each time. While brushing his teeth, try to just focus on the task and avoid coaxing, but do give the kind of praise that he enjoys as long as he is cooperating.

1294,Anxiety,"
        From your description, it is hard to know what role anxiety might play in your son's school difficulties. I recommend that you mention your conerns about anxiety to your pediatrician. To address your son's refusal to participate in schoolwork, I recommed that you work with your school on the following. First, be sure that the work your son is being asked to complete is reasonable given his skills. Ideally, your son should be able to meet success most of the time in his schoolwork, while still being challenged to expand his current skills. It would be interesting to know whether your son refuses all work or just certain types of work (e.g., math or reading). This information might give you a clue into the reasons for his refusal and might provide a basis for modifying his curriculum. If he refuses to do work that he is very capable of doing, a different strategy might be needed. In this case, consider working with your son's teacher to develop a system of rewards for completing school work. In addition, teachers should work to minimize the potential ""pay off"" for not working. For example, your son should not get lots of attention from teachers when her refuses to work, and he should be required to complete his assignments even when he protests to be sure that he is not allowed to avoid these tasks.

        My son showed similar behaviours to yours in his previous school.  I have recently managed to move him to a mainstream school that also specialises in autism/aspergers.  But it sounds like your son is in the right school, so why is he showing avoidance behaviours?
I think the Educational Psychologist needs to do some assessments to find out what his cognitive ability is.  That will give you a starting point because you will know whether his difficulties are due to his intelligence levels or down to autism, or dyslexia or some other problem in the cognitive process.
My son gets very bored at school and is very bright.  However he is not reading or writing independently yet.  He can memorise a book immediately but then not recognise those same words in a different context.  He is now beginning to understand some basic maths concepts using a system called Numicon.
Last week he won the prize in his class for French.  The whole class had played 'Simon Says' in French and his teacher told me that they couldn't get him out!  As my son has just moved to that school that was the first time he had ever heard French and the fact that he picked it up immediately showed all of us that he enjoys to learn using movement and auditory sound.  
So you really need the professionals to get involved to pick out what your son's difficulties and strenths are.  Then, where possible they need to try to tap into his abilities to address and support his areas of weakness.
Can he engage and understand class instructions.  Can he then go to his work place and sequence his work independently or does he need his work to be structured for him.  Can he ask for help if he needs it.  Does he have access to visual cards to show to an adult if he finds it hard to speak.  Does he have access to a quiet room if he needs some time out.  Are there sensory or environmental issues in the classroom that need to be addressed.  Does he have visual/verbal or auditory memory retrieval problems.  Does he have auditory processing disorder or Irlen Syndrome.
There is a long list of things for them to start working on.  Do they use his interests to motivate him eg. first reading book and then 15 minutes on the computer (if that is something he has chosen that he likes to do).  Does he struggle during playtime and dinnertime.  Are there any dinnertime clubs he could go to.
If he is verbal has anyone asked him 'why' he is getting under the table.  He may be able to tell you why, or he may just do that because of how he is feeling but he cannot pinpoint why he is feeling like that.  In those cases of overstimulation or anxiety he may just need the option of time out, or a short break either doing something he likes or something physical like jumping up and down, or pushing  against a wall, or pulling on a piece of rope with the TA.

        Good Morning,
My son has been diagnosed for 2 years now with Aspergers syndrom- this is a form of high functioning autism- and he to is social with family and friends, will make eye contact and can follow instructions etc. Yet in other areas he has  ""swiss cheese"" like abilities for his age. loves to make noises, reptative motions, lines up toys does not play, has difficulty understanding abstract ideas and most of the time plays parallel to other kids but not with them. There are other things also that started showing up this year,like high anxiety. I have learned that just because your child does not fit the criteria to a T does not mean that your instincts as a mom are wrong. My advice is if you feel something is not right just keep persuing it till you get an answer. Ours took 5 years!

        If you believe that your son meets the criteria for an autism diagnosis, it is important to bring your child to a specialist in diagnosing autism.  This might be a developmental pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, child psychiatrist, or child psychologist, among others.  Make sure that the individual providing the diagnosis has experience in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders.  Your pediatrician, local hospital, or school district should be able to refer you to a qualified individual.  Make sure that the diagnosis and the reasons for it are fully explained to you and that you don’t have any confusion about the reasons for the diagnosis.  If you have any concerns, seek a second opinion and find a diagnostician you trust and are comfortable with.

1302,My 4 years son does not show interest in playing with kids of his age,"
        Hi, I am a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum.  
Did you say that your child has never formally been diagnosed as being on the spectrum whether that is autism or aspergers?
Even if it is the case that your child does not have 'enough' of the characteristics to get a full diagnosis, that can still mean that he has autistic traits, and these need to be addressed in the same way as a child with a full diagnosis.  By that I mean his difficulties will be lifelong, and he will need help and support to 'learn' about social interaction etc.  He may well 'learn' some set ways of behaving in certain situations, but it will always be learnt and not a 'natural reaction to the situation'.  
Children on the spectrum always seem to pay attention and be focused on things that are of interest to them.  That could be anything from a piece of fluff, to a starwars DVD.  Getting them to pay attention to things they need to eg. listen to the teacher is class, is always going to be difficult.  That is why they need supports and strategies in school.  For example of they cannot 'listen' to the teacher then they need their lessons printed out for them to read and follow the instructions.  If they cannot read then they need a teaching assistant to check they know what they should be doing and they may need tasks breaking down into small numbered units for them to follow.  This is something an Educational Psychologist would be advising on in a mainstream school, or a specialist school should have knowledge of doing that.
'Playing' is always going to be problematic.  For example, my son's way of playing is that he wants to re-enact something he has seen on TV or on a DVD.  If the other children comply and understand their roles and their diaglogue (because it must be the exact same dialogue), then everything goes well.  If they want to change the storyline then it usually ends in tears.  Children on the spectrum tend to be very good a memorising things, whether it is TV dialogue, adverts, jingles etc.  Playing in a imaginative way, and allowing other children to contribute and change the story line is difficult for them.

1303,My 4 years son does not show interest in playing with kids of his age,"
        I had to cut my post in two.  This is the second part.

To be more interested in learning, he has to be interested in the subject matter.  For example if he is interested in Starwars you can teach alot using that one subject.  
Progressing socially is going to be difficult.  Try to always use things he is interested in.  For example joining clubs that he likes.  Typical things that children on the spectrum enjoy is trampolining, swimming, rock climbing, scouts, fishing, art, music etc.  All of these involve social interaction.  But if he struggles with something like football it is useless trying to get him to play in a team.  He may find the concept of team games difficult.  He may not be able to tolerate unpredictable physical contact etc.
I have found Play Therapy very useful, but you have to find a Play Therapist who has experience of children on the spectrum and one that doesn't just use Play Therapy for children who are emotionally disturbed.

1304,My 4 years son does not show interest in playing with kids of his age,"
        Oh my, your son sounds exactly like mine!  We are currently trying to get a medical diagnosis.  We have been told developmental delay and possible Aspergers (however, I question the aspergers because he is so easy going and laid back)  However, we did discover that my son has an extremely low receptive language delay (which means he does not always understand what is said to him).  However, his expressive language (the language he uses is average or above).  The speech pathologist told me sometimes if my son does not comprehend what I am saying he may try to fill in by talking about a cartoon, or favorite interest, etc.  We also learned that my son has a vestibular sensory disorder, which means he does not receive enough sensory input and therefore needs to run and make noise, which also makes it extremely difficult for him to sit in circle time at preschool.  You may already know this information, but if not these are a few more areas you might want to look into.  Good Luck

1305,My 4 years son does not show interest in playing with kids of his age,"
        Yes, my son also has age appropriate expressive language, but is delayed several years with receptive speech.  He also has semantic pragmatic disorder, which you can google.  If your son repeats TV/DVD dialogue or things he hears on commercials or what other people have said, then google echolalia as that is common in children on the spectrum.
My son also has Auditory Processing Disorder, which you might like to rule out as well.  This is sometimes called CAPD as well (central auditory processing disorder).
My son flutuates between being very laid back, to a full blown tantrum if something unpredictable happens.
If your son also has sensory issues I would recommend googling the name Olga Bogdashina and reading an article by her in Autism Today.  Her book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers has a caregivers questionnaire at the back which you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.  The Autism Outreach Department in our city uses this questionnaire and it is very informative.  There are many people who don't even know the vestibular and proprioceptive senses exist.  Your son might like trampolining, rock climbing etc to get more input.  Sometimes using things like a weighted jacket can help with concentration in class, but your Occupational therapist should have all kinds of info like that.

1306,My 4 years son does not show interest in playing with kids of his age,"
        Apart from my above suggestions I would just say watch your child's behaviours.  They are there for a reason eg. covering his ears or running away from noises such as the vaccum cleaner, means he is noise sensitive.  That maybe only to certain frequences, or it may be that he cannot habituate to sounds, or it might be an accumulation of sound sources that bother him.  Remember that his sensory processing difficulty fluctuates day to day and throughout the day.  So at one point he maybe covering his ears at the slightest sound and at another period in the same day he may be playing on a drum kit, or deliberately making loud noises.  That doesn't mean 'there is no auditory problem', it means that there definately is an auditory problem and it might be the modulation that is not working properly.  Other indicators of auditory problems are appearing deaf, whispering or shouting, getting frustrated or angry if you talk to them when they are doing something, breaking the telephone or toys that make noises, asking about noises you cannot hear, deliberately making loud noises.
Just remember there is always a reason behind the behaviour.  You just have to become a bit of a detective and do a bit of experimentation.  As your child gets older, and as they are verbal they can begin to tell you what they are experiencing.  But also remember that just because they are verbal doesn't mean that they can always tell you what is wrong.  Sometimes they don't know themselves and most of the time they don't know that they experience things differently to us in the same way that we don't understand that their experience is different to ours, we just know that it is.

1308,Does my son have aspergers?,"
        My son is diagnosed as being on the spectrum and he too doesn't need a set routine or rituals.  He is fine going to new places.  He does find it difficult leaving the house, or having to turn off the TV.  He tends to need his school work to be very structured mainly I think because it doesn't make sense to him and the structure helps him understand what he should be doing.
Is there anything that does upset him?
Remember they don't have to tick all the boxes to get a diagnosis, just enough of them in each area.  If he doesn't have enough of them that means exactly what it says.  Not enough to tip the balance towards a diagnosis, but his difficulties are still the same as a child with aspergers and the supports and structures he needs will be exactly the same as a child with a diagnosis.

        We frequently get questions about diagnosing children.  The types of behavioral patterns you are seeing are consistent with an autism-spectrum-disorder diagnosis.  It is impossible to stress enough the importance of early intensive intervention and, thus the importance of early diagnosis.  I strongly recommend that you have your child evaluated, your pediatrician, local hospital, or school district should be able to refer you to someone qualified to make the diagnosis.  A first step is often a conversation with a pediatrician who I expect will start with a hearing test and then refer you on if further testing is necessary.

1311,Is this autism,"
        As you have concerns I think you should raise them with his paediatrician and ask for a multi team evaluation.  
As you have posted here you are obviously concerned about autism.  But you need your son to be observed and assessed before a professional can make that decision.  When you ask for assessments, make sure you ask for professionals who are experienced in diagnosing this disorder.
'Appearing deaf', doesn't have to mean he has a hearing problem.  I presume you have had his hearing checked out.   With my son, who is on the autisic spectrum, it is a case of his 'attention' being focused so much on something that he basically doesn't hear anything I say.
As your son is 2, his social interaction skills should be starting to emerge.  But having him assessed is good at such a young age, because if there is something going on whether it is autism or something else, then the sooner he begins therapies and gets supports the better the outcome.
If you go onto the autism forum, and click on the Health Page icon I have posted the diagnositic criteria for autism and aspergers.  This lists the behavioural characteristics that the professionals are looking for.  Parents have also added examples of their own childrens' behaviour that fits the criteria so that may help you understand what the professionals will be looking for in your son.

1312,shaking head side way in a 10 yrs old,"
        Most likely, you are seeing a form of repetitive movement that is common among children diagnosed with autism. I recommend seeking some advice from your son's ABA therapist, if he is still working with one. A common intervention for repetive movements involves interrupting those movements as soon as they begin to occur. For example, a light touch to the shoulder might be enough to interrupt the shaking without distracting your son from his reading. Given that your son is in 4th grade, it may be useful to work with his school on a self-monitoring program that would teach your son to recognize when he is shaking his head and to reward him for reading without head shaking. I would also mention this concern to your son's pediatrician so that he can assess your child in person to rule out other issues.

A possibility you might like to rule out is Irlen Syndrome.  Alot of children/adults with autism and dyslexia have this.  It is a visual perceptual problem which is easily helped by wearing tinted glasses or by using tinted overlays for written work.
If you google Irlen Syndrome, it should give you alot of information about it.  It is a recognised medical condition.

1314,Developmental Disorder,"
        I am a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum.
The things you mention I would recognise as being either obsessions or ridig ritualistic behaviour associated with an autistic spectrum disorder.
As he is already having speech therapy it might be worth you asking for a full multi disciplinary team evaluation through health rather than education.
If he is on the spectrum he sounds like he is high functioning, but it might explain some of his odd behaviour and knowing if that was the cause of it would help you decide on the kind of schooling and the level of support he might need.
If you go onto the autism forum and click on the Health Page icon on the top right hand corner of the page you can read a post called Behavioural Characteristics behind the Diagnosis of an ASD.  This lists the clinical criteria for a diagnosis.  Parents have also posted examples of their child's behaviour so that you know the kind of things the professionals are looking for.
Covering his ears is a sensory thing.  Those on the spectrum tend to receive sensory stimulus differently to us.  Sometimes they are over sensitive to it, sometimes under sensitive and can appear not to hear, or feel, or taste, or smell anything.  At other times the slightest touch will appear to hurt them, they will cover their ears, avoid eating certain foods, complain about smells, say that their clothes are bothering them etc.

        I am a parent of a child on the autistic spectrum, not a professional.
I am in the UK, and heard on the news today that Risperadal is not to be prescribed to children under 5 years of age because it can stunt the growth.  I have also heard it can cause weight gain.
I am not anti medication as sometimes it is the only thing that works.  However there is no long term medical research as to the long term side effects of these drugs on our children.
The tics you mention can be a side effect of the medication and it can be permanent.
What are you medicating your child for?
What kind of school does he go to?
If you feel that he is taking the medication to allow him to remain in a mainstream school then I would seriously suggest looking at special education provision without the medication.  In a different educational environment he might not have so much anger/agression or frustration.

        Given the types of delays that you are noticing, I would highly recommend having your daughter assessed and moving quickly on early intervention.  Although there is a wide range in the rate of development of language, catching delays early and intervening early can have very positive effects on your child's acquisition of language and the possibility of her catching up with her peers.  Good choices for people to conduct an assessment include developmental pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, child psychiatrists, and child psychologists.  Make sure that the individual providing the diagnosis has experience in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders.  Your pediatrician, local hospital, or school district should be able to refer you to a qualified individual.  Regardless of who you are seeing, make sure that the diagnosis and the reasons for it are fully explained to you.  You shouldn't find yourself walking away confused about the diagnosis.  If you have any concerns, seek a second opinion and find a diagnostician you trust and are comfortable with.

        Your baby sounds terribly brite!  They all mature at differant speeds and mature in one area faster than others.  I knew something was not right with my boy and know one would hear me.  They would all say the same thing I just said.  If you feel something is not right do not second guess yourself!
Be confident with what your views are.  Document everything that you see her do or hear her say.  Keep a jurnal and write down things as they occur with dates.  They will not test until 3 years old- that is the age when kids are gradually coming together in there stage of maturity. 

On an upscale note, I have a neighbor that had a little girl that did not speak until three when she did though it was in complete sentenses.  Turns out she is just extremely shy.

My advise to you would be to tell her to ""use her big girl words"" and make her use 3 word sentences.  It will be hard but instead of excepting ""Drink"" from her tell her to say ""want drink please"" Try this as well...  When asking her about her colors avoid ""wh"" questions like when, where, what and why.  instead of asking ""what color is this?"" as your said above ask instead ""Is this color blue?"" when infact the color is red she may surprise you and answer you by correcting you with saying ""Red"".  Then ask ""Am I Daddy?""  and see if you can make communication that way.  Try to keep the questions ones that are not yes and no answers

Google echolalia and see if that is relevant to how your son uses speech.  If it is then you need to go to your doctor and ask for a referal to a Speech and Language Therapist.  If you suspect autism, tell your doctor that and you should ask for a SALT with experience of this diagnosis.
As well as a SALT a paediatrician and physcologist should observe and assess your son before you get any kind of diagnosis.
If you go onto the Autism forum, at the top right hand corner of the page click on the Health Page icon and go into the Behaviourial Characteritics behind a Diagnosis of Autism.  That gives the DSM IV clinical diagnostic criteria.  This is the criteria the doctors look at to decide if your child is autistic (on the spectrum) or not.  Parents have also posted examples of their childs behaviour that meets the criteria, so that should help you see what behaviours the doctors are looking for.

        My son is also echolalic.  He used to repeat things I said to him when he was a toddler.  But from age 3+ he started repeating TV/DVD dialogue and also uses phrases, words, accents etc from films and TV in his speech.  Now I would say his speech is 50/50 his own and delayed echolalic speech.  He finds it harder to find the words to put together a sentence himself.  It is easier for him to use a phrase he has already heard and use it correctly in its emotional context.  So, for example, if his father were to tease him, he might say 'I'm going to send you to Timbuktu'.  That phrase comes from Walt Disneys the Aristocats and is what the butler says to the cats because he wants them out of the way.  So, autistic children can be very clever in the way they put together their speech.  I know that I could do it like my son does.
So your child's speech will improve.  But he will need input from Speech and Language Therapy and may need assessing by other professionals to see if he needs other supports in school.

        I have a 51/2 year old that has the same issues.  He has aspergers and is high fuctioning but puts everything in his mouth.  I have been told by his therapist this is a sensory issue.  At my sons school they wear a jacket that he has different feels and objects for him to touch while he is there.  While going to a flea market or such a place that he might pick up things and put in his mouth I give him bubble wrap.  He loves it and this keeps his hands busy such that he won't put items in his mouth.  Still at home I have to remove all rubber wheels from his toys and monator all small objects with constant vigalance.

1326,obsessive chewing,"
        A book I found very useful about sensory issues is by Olga Bogdashina called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  If you google her name you can read an article by her in Autism Today.
In that book there is a caregivers questionnaire that you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.  Our Autism Department uses this questionnaire and asks all parents to complete it.
From reading the book my understanding is that all information and learning about our environment comes in through all our senses.  If any of them are not functioning properly and are not able to receive or interpret that information, or if there is a problem with the communication between the senses, then a child/adult may rely on other senses to discover its environment.
Trying to address these differences means that you have to use ways such as Ridina mentions to keep the child safe.  But I would also suggest looking at the other senses to see if any improvements in them could lead to a reduction in the chewing.  The abovementioned book should help you get a better picture of your child's sensory profile so that you know what areas to start working on.

        You should contact your local public school and have your child evaluated. Because your child is 3 years old school systems are required to provide services to children in their town. I would also suggest that you go try to identify a hospital in an urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children who present developmental delays. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations. You can then take these recommendations to your local school.

        Hi!  I am new to this site too.  I have a bit of advice.  I am a mother of a 51/2 year old with aspergers.  I also have a sister in-law with two special needs children.  She gave me advice years ago that really helped.  This is actually a sensory issue that your child seems to be having and may not be the taste.  Find something he likes like pudding or applesauce and very, very slowly over the course of days, even months introduce the foods such as beef untill eventually he is chewing the entire new food.  Another note:
My oldest daughter is actually the pro at getting my son eat to eat what he does today.  Although I won't kid myself it is still a battle.  She suggests using different words like for instance,  when he puts the foods in his mouth ask him to ""touch it with his teeth"" rather than the word ""chew"".  Then make a game and ask him to try ""touching"" something else.  ask him if it feels funny.  Make it a game- you do it too and the rest of the family!
Let me know how that works!

1330,Sexual curiosity and autistic children,"
        Children do get curious about their and other peoples bodies.
I have a 7.5 year old son with autism.  He also has a speech disorder, but his level of understanding is age appropriate.  
Does your son see you and your husband naked?  Does he have any brothers or sisters?  
My son started by asking some questions about his body and how it was different to mine.  I just answered his questions as simply as I could without going into too much detail.
We also keep alot of animals eg. chickens, ducks, goats etc.  So he does see them 'in the act' quite often, and I have told them that they are 'making babies'.
He did ask about how babies are made a few months back.  So I gave a brief explanation of 'how' a baby is made.  My son looked at me and said ""I'm not doing that with you, you can ask Daddy.""  That misunderstanding was so funny.  So I had to quickly explain that he only would do that when he was grown up and he would only do it with someone he wanted to.
How about if you start by talking with him about the names of body parts in general and what they do.  Then you could talk about the difference between girls and boys.  Then just build on that information as and when it arises.  Afterall at 6 years old it is perfectly acceptable for him to be naked on the beach or in the back garden paddling pool etc.  
You might find a picture book would be useful.  As your child has autism, can one of the professionals involved with him recommend one.  You will also have to teach him that only him, mum and dad can touch him in that place, unless it is someone mum or dad say it is okay with such as a doctor.
If his curiosity is causing him to take this kind of interest in other children or people.  Then it will be down to him not understanding what is socially appropriate, or he may need to see that every girl is different or every boy is the same as him.  You can use social stories to tell him what is appropriate and what isn't.
But in this instance I suspect it was probably your friends child who was the instigator as it is usually autistic children that are manipulated rather than the other way around.

        This is clearly a very difficult situation with your son and I appreciate the difficulties that you are going through.  I’m not clear on whether your son has been diagnosed with an autism-spectrum disorder but, in any case, effective treatment of aggression can be found regardless of diagnosis.  I am glad to hear that you have read up on disciplinary techniques and have tried quite a few.  The procedures that you list definitely can work but, given your situation, I would recommend getting some help from a professional who has experience in treating behavior problems.  I strongly recommend that you seek the assistance of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers. A Board Certified Behavior Analyst would be able to conduct or oversee an assessment to determine why your son is displaying this problematic behavior. An intervention based on this type of assessment is very likely to reduce you son’s problematic behavior and the development of an intervention does not rely on diagnosis.

        Hi,
My 9 year old son also flicks/waves/rubs his fingers...it's called stimming or self stimulation.  Most kids with ASD do some sort of stimming behavour.  I have heard from various medical professionals alternate therories...that the repetative motion is calming, helps minimize outside stimuli, is a form of communication of excitment.  My son has a baby blanket (or should I say a piece of) that he continually whips around while making a gutteral moaning sound.  Some therapists have said to discontinue this and try to find something more socially suitable (figet toys, you can find them on the internet). We have opted that he can use his blankey at home but it stays at home as he is aware that he might be teased or it might be too distracting to him and others in public.  This was only possible however, after our son was aware of his diagnosis, that he was concerned about social stigma....
Don't know if this helps but you can probably find more information on the net: Autism Self Stimulation

        I would certainly recommend that you seek an in-person consultation regarding this new behavior. You did not mention if your son has been diagnosed with autism. As you may know, repetitive motor movements are very common among children with autism. Often, repetitive behaviors can be treated behaviorally be keeping your child involved in appropriate activities and interrupting the repetive behavior. But I think it is a good idea to have your son seen. It is better to be cautious and to address problems at the onset.

1339,strange behaviour,"
        I'm not an expert, just a parent with a child on the autistic spectrum and with sensory integration disorder.
From reading your post the thing that springs to mind is tics or tourettes.  You don't say if he has a diagnosis of anything else.  If he is on the spectrum, and temper tantrums can be part of this because of their frustration and our not keeping to their rigid routines/rituals or expections; then tourettes is one of those disorders that can also occur with autism.
But to find out for sure you will need to go to your GP or your child's paediatrician and ask for an assessment.  
If it is tics or tourettes then these are usually worse if the child is anxious or stressed, so it would help to look at any ways you can reduce his stress and anxiety levels by using structured systems so that he knows what is going to happen in what order throughout the day.

        I am not a professional, just a parent with a child on the autistic spectrum.  I don't know the science behind it, but alot of parents have reported that their children's concentration is better using fish oil EPA and DHA.  Infact there have been reported inprovements in concentration and it having a calming (de-stressing) effect on anyone, not just children on the spectrum or with ADHD.  Whether it is useful in your case, you will really have to suck it and see.  But try to go for a good quality product with EPA and DHA.  There are also combinations of omega 3, 6, and 9 oils available.  I think they need to be taken for a number of months before you see any improvement.
But this is also a non-invasive option to try and the omega oils are known to have health benefits.

1342,Advance diet,"
        This is probably a sensory issue and his tactile, smell or taste senses could be hypersensitive so that he doesnt like the feeling of harder food in his mouth, or he doesn't like the smell or taste of other foods.
As he has sensory differences I would recommend a book by Olga Bogdashina called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  At the back of this book is a caregivers questionnaire that you can complete to get a sensory profile of your child.  My child is mainly affected with his tactile and auditory sense, but all his other senses also fluctuate between being over or under sensitive.
The Autism Advisory Department in our city uses this questionnaire to get a sensory profile of all the children with autism in the district, so it is a reputable tool.
What you may find is that when you know which senses are most affected and you make alterations to make it easier to perceive and interpret information through that senses, then it has a knock on effect on the other senses.
The professional who deals with Sensory Differences is an Occupational Therapist and you need one that has experience with autism and sensory integration disorders.
Out of interest does he also complain about smells, or like to smell things.  Is he tactile sensitive ie. a soft touch feels like it hurts him and at other times he injures himself but appears to feel nothing?  Is he okay with clothes tags and different materials.  Is he okay wearing shoes and socks.  Does he complain about the taste of food saying it is hot or spicy, or does he eat things and appear not to be able to taste them.  Is his balance okay, or does he appear clumsy or move awkwardly.

I think it would be reasonable to have your son seen by a professional who specializes in diagnosing Asperger's Syndrome. But, independent of his diagnosis, I would suggest trying to identify some social skills training for your son and working with the school to improve his experiences there.

1348,My 3 year old having his autism diagnosis removed,"
        I am a parent, not an expert.  I would recommend you contact the National Autistic Society in your country to get some advice.
Is getting a private assessment an option?
As you already have a son with autism you will already know about the DSM IV diagnostic criteria (if not go onto the autism forum, click on the Health Page icon on the top right hand side and go into Behavioural Characteristics behind a Diagnosis of Autism).  Does he have difficulties in the three areas ie. difficulties with speech/language, social interaction, lack of imagination, need for routines/rituals or repetitive behaviour, sensory issues?  
Why did school ask for a re-evaluation.  I presume that they saw him demonstrating some behaviour that they thought made it likely he wasn't on the spectrum.  But having said that, many higher functioning autistic children can demonstrate 'typical' behaviours, but they may not be able to do it all the time, or may have problems generalising that behaviour into another similar environment.
He has only been diagnosed 6 months ago, re-evaluations usually take place once a year.  They are usually a multi disciplinary team evaluation with Speech and Language Therapist, Educational Psychologist, Paediatrician, possible Occupational Therapy as well.  This is because, as you know, children can be variable day to day and throughout the day.  All these experts will carry out assessments and observations.  Has your child been diagnosed through education or health?  If it was through education I would go to your GP and ask for a multi disciplinary team evaluation through Health.
I would probably argue that, as you've said, he has only been diagnosed 6 months ago and that they should look more carefully over a longer period of time before withdrawing the diagnosis and the support that provides.  And I would start a daily diary at home writing down examples of behaviour considered to be on the spectrum.
Having said that, it would be wonderful if he was just copying his brother, and if that is the case then it should become more obvious when he socialises with other children at school that he is fitting in with them, but from your point of view you will need to see this for yourself.
From your post your child is now 4 years old?

1349,My 3 year old having his autism diagnosis removed,"
        Sorry, I see he was diagnosed in 2006.  Still his re-evaluation was 6 months ago and he still fitted the criteria then.  From you and your son's point of view you need some constancy!  If he is really borderline, in six months time he might fit the criteria again!  Even if he is borderline, because of the lifelong difficulties/differences I would probably push to try to keep the diagnosis because of the supports/services it brings with it.  Or does he now fit a diagnosis of PDD NOS?  Again I would recommend speaking to the National Autistic Society because they will have a much greater understanding of the different diagnosis and the impact on services that each diagnosis brings.
It is just so ironic that so many people post on the forums fearing a diagnosis, when those of us who have one fear it being taken away!

1350,My child has high functioning autism.,"
        It is quite common for children to behave quite differently at home and school. Sometimes more appropriate behavior is observed at home and in other cases the reverse is true. It would be useful to consider the differences between the home and school environments and to try to ""borrow"" those aspects of the school environment that seem most helpful. For example, it is possible that she behaves more appropriately at school because there are more structured activities available or because there are different consequences for inappropriate behavior. I recommend talking with her teacher to determine what you might try at home.

        PDD is a diagnostic category defined by the behavioral characteristics of the individual.  Typically, people with this diagnosis have deficits in communication and/or social interaction and emit some forms of stereotyped or repetitive behavior patterns.  Because the criteria are behavioral, there is no single cause of the deficits associated with PDD.  Therefore, the complications associated with your daughter’s illness may have affected her behaviorally such that she meets the diagnostic criteria.  Systematic, behavior-analytically based educational intervention is the most empirically supported teaching method for strengthening verbal skills.  I would recommend seeking appropriate educational services for her in addition to appropriate medical services.  It also sounds like you are not entirely convinced by what her doctors are telling you.  If you have any concerns about any of the services or diagnoses that she is receiving, I recommend bringing those to her doctors and also seeking second opinions.

        What professionals have seen your grand daughter and what reason did they give that she wasn't on the spectrum?
If you go over to the autism forum and click on the Health Page icon on the top right hand corner of that page, have a look at the 'Behavioural Characteristics behind the DSM IV clinical criteria for a diagnosis of autism'.  DSM IV is a medical book that lists all the different disorders and what the criteria is to get a diagnosis for each individual disorder.   Professionals use these criteria to decide if your child is on the spectrum or not.  Some parents have also posted examples of their childs behaviours that met the clinical criteria to help others identify what kind of things are relevant.
As you say your grand daughter has sensory issues I would recommend you google the name Olga Bodgashina and read an article by her printed in Autism Today.  She has a very good book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.  This book has a caregivers questionnaire at the back of it that you can complete to get an picture of your child's sensory profile.  For example your grand daugther may have differences with the senses of smell and taste.  Olga is a reputable professional and her questionnaire is used by our autism department.
If the family definately thinks that autism is behind it then you need to go to your GP or paediatrician and ask for a multi disciplinary team evaluation by professionals who are experienced in diagnosising autistic spectrum disorders.  This usually involves a Speech and Language Therapist, Psychologist, Occupational Therapist (if motor or sensory issues are involved), and may include other such as Neurologist etc depending on the child.

        My son is the same age and I think some of the things you've described may just be typical for that age.  In the last few weeks, my son has also started throwing what I think are tantrums.  He seems to fixate on certain things (random stuff, like the phone, or a piece of mail, or a piece of tupperware) and if you take it away, he flips out.  He throws himself on the floor and cries.  If I pick him up during one of these 'fits', he screams even louder and stiffens and extends his whole body.  If I give the item back to him, he immediately calms down (and usually smiles or laughs).  When you say that he doesn't show affection, is it all the time or just during one of these episodes?

I've followed a lot of your posts on Ashtyn's--isn't he standing and/or starting to walk with support?  When my son was in that stage, he used everything as a 'walker' - chairs, cushions, some very large blocks - basically, anything at the right height to give him support to walk.  I guess if Ashtyn is sitting and pushing stuff along he floor, that is different, but maybe it's just a behavior that letting him practice walking movements.

I don't know what to tell you about the spinning.  That does seem a little unusual if he's doing it with everything.  I wouldn't count ceiling fans though - many kids are mesmerized by those.  Best of luck.  You are doing such a great job with him, I'm sure you'll get some answers on these concerns soon enough.

        Thanks for the message. As he gets older, I know that things will be more clear. I just kinda like to follow what he is or is not doing and see where he lines up with other kids. I have never really been around other kids, so I don't have anything to compare Ashtyn to...so basically everything I am learning about development, I am learning as we go lol. Thanks again for the message. Ashtyn is standing and he will walk around things with support. But ashtyn doesn't use things as a walker, he crawls across the floor with the object under his hand and he pushes it.

        I'm not sure if i'm understanding your question, but my understanding is that your autistic son is boarding somewhere and that the rest of the family has moved elsewhere and that there are no suitable facilities in the area you have moved to?
Could you get in touch with a legal advocacy service that has experience of dealing with special education needs (not sure how old your child is).  They should be able to tell you what kind of services you can access.
Regarding how you feel about your family being split up, I think you just have to continue reinforcing to your son that you love him etc.  He may well understanding alot more than you would ever know.  There have been some non-verbal autistic people who having learnt to use a computer have astounded everyone with their intellect and ability, but we rely so much on language and social interaction and base our judgements on a persons ability within those areas.
Could you set up the process to make a scrap book about him and family so that he can look at it and you can send him things to put in it as a regular way of contact?

        An accurate assessment can be made only by a qualified professional during an in-person assessment. The responsibiltiy for assessment and referral is in the hands of the professionals with whom the familiy interacts (e.g., speech therapist, pediatrician). If the mother of this child is your best friend, I recommend that you support her and her family as much as possible. Interactions with children who have limited skills and behavioral difficulties are often not very rewarding. It sounds like this is your experience with your best friend's child. Do your best to focus on the positive things that the child does and recognize those to both the child and her mother. Often, the best approach to reducing unwanted behavior is to work to increase appropriate behavior while mimizing the focus on the unwanted behavior.

        I would absolutely recommend seeking appropriate special education and speech therapy services for your child.

1371,Is Speech delay always autism,"
        It is good that you have been accessing services for your son and that you recognized early that he had delayed speech. A diagnosis of autism involves deficits in social interactions (no eye contact), delayed language and rigidity in routines or perseverative behaviors that are hard to interrupt. If you have concerns about a diagnosis I would recommend that you identify a hospital in a nearby urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children who present developmental delays including autism. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations. You can then take these recommendations to your local early intervention program.

1372,Is Speech delay always autism,"
        So is he seeing a Speech Therapist, or is he on sometime of child development programme?
I can't answer your question as to whether delay is always autism, as I am not a medical professional.  I don't think it always is.  But delay is one of the criteria for a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder.
He is 2, and is just at that age when he should be becoming more social.  If he appears to not be interested in other toddlers, or is frightened of them, that would indicate a problem with social interaction.  But at 2 years old you would have to wait to see if that social side improves.
Does he has have sensory problems you are aware of.  Does he like to be hugged and touched, what is he like having his hair brushed, or cut, or his nails trimmed.  Is he okay wearing different types of fabrics, does he need tags removing from clothes.  Is he very active all the time, or is he always sitting down quietly.
I have started a Health Page, which you can assess through the autism forum page and click on the icon on the top right hand side of the page.  I have put the diagnostic criteria for autism in there and have asked parents to put examples of their own children's behaviour so that others will have an idea of what kinds of things the professionals are looking for when they observe the child or speak to the parents.  That may give you some help to know what you are looking for.

1377,My son has a obsession with spitting,"
        As you probably know, repetitive behaviors are a characteristic of Aspergers, and these behaviors can take many forms. Independent of you son's diagnosis, I recommend that you seek some recommmendations regarding how to address you son's behavioral concerns. Certainly, spitting would tend to isolate your son socially. There are a number of very effective behavioral interventions available for repetive behaviors such as spitting. But, you would need to find a qualified professional who could observe you son and make recommendations. I can understand your frustration in finding qualified professionals in your geographic area. It may be necessary, as it is for many families, to travel quite a distance to find professionals qualified to help.

1378,My son has a obsession with spitting,"
        There are a number of conditions/disorders that can tend to cluster together sometimes in one person or within the family.  These are things like autism/aspergers, OCD, touretts, Bi-polar, Dyspraxia, Sensory Integration Disorder, Learning Difficulty etc etc.
My understanding of OCD is that it is usually anxiety driven and the person usually feels that if they don't do the ritual/routine that something bad will happen to them or family members.  That is different to how someone with Aspergers may need a ritual or routine because it makes the situation familiar and predictable.  If your son is talking about a bad taste in his mouth making him want to spit that sounds like it could be a sensory thing because it is the 'bad taste' driving him to spit, not anxiety or a need for a predictable outcome.  It is quite possible that he does indeed have a 'bad' taste in his mouth because he is oversensitive to something.  Taste is also closely connected to smell.  Does he ever complain about smells or like to smell things?
If you are able to pay for a private Psychologist report then it could be very useful, especially if there are co-morbid conditions (ie. not just one diagnosis going on).  Make sure it is someone with expertise in autism/aspergers.  You should also try to find out about any parent support/advocates in your area.  This will help you find out what your rights are by law.  Anyone who assess your son through Education or Health will have a 'budget' they are working with and the idea is to provide the least amount they can get away with.
So you need a specialist evaluation that will show you what your sons strengths and weaknesses are and how Aspergers affects him from a language, social interaction, imagination, cognitive, behavioural, life skills point of view.  Then you need to know your legal rights and what you can ask for from a support point of view.  For example if it says in a report that your son needs to be in small group work, what does that mean.  You need it quantified ie. a small group of 3-5 children.  Otherwise his school could define a small group as being 15 children.  The same will apply to every recommendation they make.  Eg. he needs help to make friendships.  What specialist is going to advise school on that.  Who will they train in the daily implementation of that programme in school.  How often will it be included in his weekly timetable.  How will they monitor his progress.  How often will it be reviewed and by whom.  If that is not specified then the school may interpret that recommendation as 'he needs to play a game with another pupil' to fulfill that specification and it will only happen when they have the time to do it.  So it needs to be specific.  I've sort of gone off on a tangent, but once you get the information from reports (private ones if you can afford, and if you can't afford it aim for one private report a year), get recommendations quantified in terms of hours and staffing provision.  Otherwise if you don't get it quantified you can never prove if they are providing the support mentioned in the reports.  And they can also try to mainstream him if there are no quantified hours ie. a pupil needing 22+ hours a week support in one to one and small group work of no more than 5 children is less likely to get mainstreamed than a child whose reports state he needs 'significant' support, but who has only ever received 5 hours extra support a week if it was available.  That child will get mainstreamed first.
Try to prioritise reports from a need point of view.  If there are lots of things 'going on' that you are unclear about a private Psychologists report might be the most sensible first.  Depending on what that identifies you may need an Occupational Therapist's report next etc etc.
If there is other sensory stuff going on such as a dislike of loud/sudden noises, an aversion to certain types of clothing or tags in clothes or shoes and socks, an aversion to brushing/washing hair, problems with food texture or smells, problems with balance or proprioception (motor co-ordination), problems with recognising the samer person/environment even if there are slight changes etc then I would recommend you google the name Olga Bogdashina and read an article by her printed in Autism Today website.  She has two autistic children herself and is the principle of a school for autistic children in the Uktraine.  Her book Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Aspergers and Autism is groundbreaking stuff and gives a real insight into the strange behaviours we see (such as the spitting you mention with your son).
I'm not sure about the face pulling etc.  Could be part of anxiety due to fear through the book you said he read.  You have to remember that they don't have the imagination to recognise what is fact and fiction.  They take what they see and read literally.  You may need to explain to him that the book is not real and although it is really scary some people like that, but that he is safe because it is not real.
My son had alot of problems around stuff he saw on TV that he thought was real.  I had a touch time trying to explain to him what actors were and that they were playing out a story.  Even now he sometimes doesn't get that it is not real.  He can watch a film and get really upset with the storyline, especially if someone dies or gets hurt.  To us it is obvious that it is fiction, but to them it is real and they can get scared that it will happen to them.
Hope some of that makes sense and is helpful.

1379,My son has a obsession with spitting,"
        Since my original post we have continued our quest by seeing literally a host of doctors.  His main doctor has put him through all the MRI's, EEG's, blood work, etc. - cleared him on any type of physical type of abnormality and now he has been given a precise diagnosis of Aspergers.  We found a Child Psychologist that travels to our house once every other week and does wonders for him!  His spitting seems to be just one of the compulsive, repetitive things that he does.  The spitting is the leading repetitive symptom he has, then hand flapping, then mouth gaping.  He tends to get confused, and lost once in a while in our own house but that is on a bad day.
     His Child Psychologist says that we, especially me, need to do more activities with him because that seems to be the only thing that motivates him to speak with her.  Now that I have had time to think about this and spend quality time outside of the house with him, I've found that he seems to be more of a ""normal"" boy when fly fishing or even out on day hikes.  Yes, he can do both of those things.  They involve repetative things over and over again and he seems to catch more fish than me but when we get back in the car or give him a multi task condition, he struggles or can't do it.  She also agrees with the diagnosis but feels that there are things we can do to help in her words ""manipulate"" his brain into a way of thinking a little differently so that he can be a little more socially active and not be afraid of books, movies.
    I do have a question and I don't know if you can answer.  Since my last post, I have quit my job and will be starting another job in a week.  The new job will have much fewer hours so I'll be able to take much better care of my son but we will have a significant income drop.  My wife carries our insurance for us so it looks like I will be the primary care giver for our son.  I have come to the conclusion that he isn't going to come out of this thing and he will always need special attention from one of us.  Our finances are completely fouled up to put it bluntly and we have now put in for Medicade on our Son.  We have also set up a interview for Social Security for our Son also.  This has been an ongoing fued between my wife and I for a long time.  She refuses to believe that he has a life long ailment.  I believe he has a life long ailment that can be delt with just fine as long as he is properly taken care of in the beginning.  I promised my wife I would ask this question...If our son was to be granted social security for 12 years and then became a successful business person like a lot of people can do with Aspergers, will he have to pay social security back???

1380,separation from mother,"
        I am not an expert, just a mother of a 7 year old boy with autism.
Have you spoken with your ex-husband as to the reason why he is denying access?  There have been other parents in a similar position who have posted about how the childs behaviour gets out of control when they are going to visit the other parent or when they come back from the other parent.  As you are reading up about ADHD and Aspergers you will understand the difficulties these children face with any change or unpredictable outcome.  They also take things literally and therefore alot of things they may see or hear whilst their parents are separating could scare them.  The whole idea of their parents separating will make their world a very insecure place.  It may be that on times when you have seen your son that the emotional turmoil of being in a 'separated' situation has meant he has been very upset or physically violent on returning to your husband.  Obviously you won't know that unless you are in discussions with your ex-partner.  I am not condoning the the fact that he has denied you access, but he must have a reason as to why he thinks contact is not beneficial to your son.  And when you know what that is it will give you something to work on.
If you have discussions and it is your son's behaviour that is causing your ex-husband concern you could suggest seeing him at your ex-partner's house if that is a viable safe option for you.  That would mean your son is remaining in his familiar environment.
Regarding the legal side of the access you will probably have to see a solicitor about that.
As the parents you could also consider your son seeing a psychologist who has experience in ADHD and Aspergers who could see your son and give you both some ideas of what to be working on.
Play Therapy can also be a good way for children with ADHD/Aspergers to help them deal with emotions, enabling them to air their feelings with a therapist who will help them come to terms with how they feel about the whole situation.

1381,Possible Autism,"
        As you noted, repetive behaviors and preoccupations are among the characteristics of autism, but these behaviors are also observed in typical children to some degree. So, I don't think that the examples you provided are cause for alarm. If your nephew has typical social and language skills he would not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of autism. Of course, a diagnosis can only be given after a thorough assessment conducted by qualified professionals. If your family has concerns about your nephew's development you should certainly seek an appropriate evaluation.

1382,Possible Autism,"
        You are bound to have some concerns if autism is already in the family.  But children can have strange interests and not be on the spectrum.
On the autism forum, if you click on the Health Page link at the top right hand corner of the forum page I have posted the diagnostic criteria under DSM IV for autism and have asked parents to post examples of their childs' behaviour that fits the criteria.  This will give you examples of the behaviours the professionals are looking for.
If he has typical speech development then that would usually rule out autism, but might mean Aspergers.  But those with Aspergers although their speech is considered 'normal' may still have problems processing language, or may have literal interpretation of language.  They can sometimes have a strange tone of voice or emphasis the wrong part of words, or they may have an accent.
But as already stated, to get a diagnosis your nephew would have to demonstrate difficulties across all the areas.  If that were not the case then he might not get a diagnosis at all, or might have some autistic traits, or could be PDD NOS.
I am not saying that I think he is on the spectrum, just giving examples of how the diagnosis process works.
I would say have a look at the Health Page.  Search DSM IV for Aspergers to see what the difference is.  Then just observe him and keep an eye on his development and how he appears in relation to his peer group.  If there are any concerns then they should be raised through the GP or Paediatrician and a full evaluation should be asked for by professionals who have experience in diagnosing children on the spectrum.

        The concerns that you describe are fairly common among typical children, and, overall your child seems to have typical social and language skills. So, I would not be alarmed. But, if you are concerned at all about your child's development I recommend that you seek a face-to-face evaluation.

1384,concerned about aspergers type symptoms,"
        I am a parent of a 7 year old boy with autistic spectrum disorder.  Alot of what you mention sounds familiar to me with my son who is on the spectrum.  But it all depends on the extent that he does these things.  For example I went to my GP when my son was 3 and told the doctor that he was repeating things he had seen on the TV or adverts or on DVDs, and I was told that that is typical development.  Well it is to a certain extent.  But if your child is repeating phrases over and over, or repeating long dialogues to himself and giggling along to the funny bits, or using TV dialogue to communicate (which my son was), then that isn't normal.
Some of the things you mention could be sensory based, but again all children do do these behaviours.  My son used to spin, and still walks or runs in circles repeating stuff to himself.  And my son is high functioning and goes to a mainstream school.
You also mention he is sensitive to the sound of the baby.  That can be quite a common complaint of those on the spectrum about their younger siblings.  But again at his young age it could be considered 'normal'.
What I want you to know about sensory issues is that they can fluctuate between over and under sensitive throughout the day and day by day.  So for example one of my sons sensory difficulties is auditory.  So if I get the vaccum cleaner out my son and the cat run for cover.  He complains about noises I can't even hear.  He has a pair of ear defenders that he likes to wear in school.  However he also goes to drum lessons (his choice), and he likes the sound of bursting balloons!  He also appears deaf if he is absorbed watching TV or making a lego model.  Sometimes I have to repeat his name a number of times before he hears me.  That is a huge variation, so I suppose a better way to describe sensory difficulties is that their perception of incoming sensory stimuli is inconsistent and their response to the same level of stimuli can vary enormously.
Those on the spectrum also have a huge amount of attention and focus for the things they are interested in eg. lego models, puzzles, TV, thomas etc.  But they have very little/no attention for things that don't interest them.  If they are absorbed in something and a baby is crying it will disrupt their concentration and will upset them greatly.  But an inconsistent response to the same sensory stimuli is experienced by all those on the spectrum.
If you go to the autism forum and click on the health page link on the top right hand side of the page I have posted the diagnostic criteria under DSM IV for autism and parents have posted examples of their child's behaviours that meet the criteria.  That might help you get an idea of what you should be looking for.
I am not saying I think your son is on the spectrum, but I do recognise some of the things you are saying, but again it all depends on the extent to which he is doing some of that stuff.  Only you are the best judge of how he appears with his peer group.  If you have concerns then you should ask for your paediatrician to refer him for an evaluation.  If it did turn out he was on the spectrum he does sound very capable and at the higher functioning end.  As autism/aspergers can be from severe to mild, or can be just some traits but not enough to even get a diagnosis.

        He was just evaluated by this school as being delayed in every area except gross motor. And it seems all anyone at school can mention is ""PDD"". He does not have repetitive speech, is not excelled in any area, plays appropriately with toys, and demonstrates ""shared attention"". He is not overly sensitive to sensation and has no ""unusual"" fears. He will run or hop throughout the house which seems repetitive, but he seems to be burning energy. He does not prefer it to normal play and is easily redirected. My question is, can a child can be be ""on the spectrum"" without having those typical behaviors? Can children be delayed in several areas and not be Autistic or have PDD-NOS?

1386,Super stressed,"
        I'm a parent of a 7 year old boy with an autistic spectrum disorder.  My understanding is that 'delay' means that the child is not showing age appropriate skills in that particular area.  That being the case any autistic child could be called delayed with their speech, their social interaction, etc.  So could children with other diagnosis such as ADHD.  But to get a diagnosis of any disorder the child has to show enough of the charteristics in each category.  If they don't they might get no diagnosis, or it might mention traits of ....., or it might be PDD NOS ie. a pervasive developmental delay not otherwise specified, which basically means delays in certain areas but not enough of them or not in all the categories to get a full diagnosis.
As your son is just 3, he is just at that age when he will be becoming more social.  If there are any problems in that area then it will begin to show itself from this age onwards. If you go onto the autism forum page and click on the Health Page link at the top right hand side of the page I have posted the diagnostic criteria under DSM IV for autism, and parents have posted examples of their childrens' behaviour that fitted those criteria.  This will give you practical examples of what the professionals are looking for.
My advice would be to get as much therapy for your child as you can now whilst he is young and get supports in place for nursery and school.  It might be that your child has a few ADHD traits and maybe some autistic ones.  Sometimes it is just a case of having to wait and see how he develops.  But there are lots of things you can be doing.
You are already seeing Speech and Language Therapy.  
If your son has any sensory issues ie. over or under sensitive to certain things or seeks spinning, bouncing etc then an Occupational Therapist is the person you need to be referred to.
I was recommended by both Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy to get my child crawling eg. through tubes, under the duvet etc because certain movements improve the development of the brain.  Trampolining is also good because it helps the sensory side whilst also improving co-ordination, listening skills (because you have to listen to the instructions).  It can also help you highlight certain problems, for example my son found it very hard to copy certain movements demonstrating he has some cognitive/motor problems which will cause him difficulties in classroom environments.  But that is for later.  Now you want stuff that is age appropriate for a 3 year old.  So, if I were you, instead of just waiting to be referred you could find an OT and Physiotherapist who have experience with childhood development and autism/ADHD and either ask them to come and assess your son privately (if you have the money), or you could be cheeky and just ask for 10 minutes worth of advice over the phone.  There really is alot of physical stuff you could be doing playing with your son that will improve his brain development.
I've wandered away from your question somewhat.  But if you imagine an apply salad = a typically developing child, a banana salad = diagnosis of autism, and a pineapple salad = diagnosis of ADHD etc etc, then you will clearly see that some children are a mixed salad, or maybe apple salad with two pieces of banana.  If you look at it that way it might make it easier to understand.

1387,Licking hands and feet,"
        As I am sure you are aware, repetitive behaviors are characteric of Asperger's disorder. Hand mouthing or licking and saliva play are fairly common forms of repetitive behavior. Apart from the obvious health and hygiene concerns, this behavior can result in tissue damage if it persists. Therefore, I would encourage you to intervene as soon as possible. There are several well-studied behavioral interventions for repetive behaviors like those that your son is displaying. Generally, effective approaches include (a) providing an alternative form of stimulation that matches the stimulation produced, (b) interrupting or preventing the behavior, and (c) redirecting the individual to perform another activity. So, you are on the right track. I like your ideas about providing wipes and lotion. I also recommend interrupting him whenever he begins licking. You might also consider having him wash his hands each time he performs the behavior. If you (and others caring for your son) do these things consistently, I would expect to see a reduction in this behavior.

1388,Licking hands and feet,"
        As odd as the behaviour seems to you, I would rather go with it then prescribe medication.  Try to accommodate his need if you can.  Normally a licking/tasting thing is a hypo sensitive reaction ie. not getting enough information througth the senses that they need to taste to get the information they need.  Do you have the impression that any of his other senses are not functioning eg. vision, hearing, smell, etc.  I know that from a 'normal behavioural approach' what your son is doing is going to appear weird to others.  But don't medicate just because of that!  It sounds like it is mainly down to sensation.  What about taking a bottle of water with you and letting him clean his feet. then offer him a lollipop.  Try to analyse the behaviour.  If he loves salty things his taste could by hyposensitive and he is using his taste in licking hands/feet to understand his enviornment.  Try giving him other things to mouth eg. keys, lollipops, chewy sweets etc to see if this helps.
Do you suspect any problems with his other senses.  Is his vision okay.  Does he have problems with floor colours or patterns, depth perception etc.  Is his hearing okay, or does he have problems with loud noises.
What is he like with food in general.  Is he quite restrictive.  Does he always ask for a certain kind of food and drink?
There can be OCD tendencies, but it is just as plausible that it could be rigid behaviours and routines.  So don't panic yet!  
Sometimes they have a new behaviour/obsession and it lasts a couple of months and they grow out of it.  Don't give it too much attention, but try to analysis it as much as you can.  Ask him about it and what he is doing and why.

        My daugther used to lick her hand & then blow on it because she liked the sensation.  Now she likes to suck on ice, so she is constantly in the freezer getting ice.  I think your options are either to let it go, or try to pursuade him to a ""more acceptable to you"" behavior.  I would not go to meds for this issue.  It does not sound like OCD.  I think he just likes how it feels.

1390,does my child have autism or asperger's syndrome,"
        If you go to the autism forum you can access the Health Page, the icon is on the top right hand side of the forum page.  I have posted the diagnostic critieria (DSM IV) for autism and some parents have posted examples of their child's behaviour so that you have examples of the behaviour that fits the criteria.  
That page is for autism.  If your son has no language delay then a diagnosis (if any) would probably be Aspergers.  So you can google DSM IV for Aspergers and see the difference.  But the Health Page might be useful to give you examples.
Because autism and aspergers are spectrum disorders, it means they vary from severe to very mild.  Some children may not have enough of the charteristics in all the sections to even get a diagnosis, or they might get a diagnosis of PDD NOS, or they may be told their child has autistic traits.  I am saying that because it is not true that children on the spectrum do not have emotions or empathy or a sense of humour or theory of mind.  Some might not, but some definately do although it might not be all the time and they may have problems monitoring what is happening in their environment and with other people when they are focused on something.  Ie. they can be totally unaware of what is going on, but if the situation is explained to them they may be perfectly capable of reacting appropriately.
Children on the spectrum can also be hyperactive and have problems with paying attention and focus (yet they have a huge amount of attention and focus for the things they are interested in), but so can children with ADD or ADHD.  Do you suspect your child has any sensory issues, eg. sensitive to noise, touch, problems with hair/nails being cut, fabrics and clothes tags, appears deaf, appears not to feel pain, complains of smells or tastes, spins/flaps or seeks movement?  If so please post back and I will give you some more info.  An Occupational Therapist would deal with sensory issues.  Problems with handwriting are also common for those on the spectrum.
Your post describes a child who is having difficulties at school with paying attention or maybe understanding what is expected of him.  He may have problems following instructions or sequencing tasks.  Most children on the spectrum need the teacher to address them by name and give them instructions.  They don't understanding that general class instructions also includes them.
Having tantrums, getting very upset/angry is also typical of an autistic spectrum disorder.  That might be due to change or being asked to stop playing because it is time for tea, or not being able to predict an outcome and therefore refusing to co-operate.
Mood swings are also common and so are fixations on certain things as well as a restricted area of interest and their interests can be to the level of obsession.
Some children may have a need for routines and rituals and may get very upset if things are done differently because they will think you have done it wrong.
Because an autistic spectrum disorder as part of the diagnosis includes difficulties with social interaction and understanding another person's point of view, that can mean the child can appear selfish or self centred.  They aren't, because you need to have an awareness of other peoples needs/feelings etc and still want only your own way to be called selfish.  If you have trouble understanding other peoples needs, intentions, feelings etc then all you can react to his your own needs and desires.
My son is diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder.  One therapy I have found very useful is Play Therapy.  You might consider it for your son on two levels.  Firstly, through play, your son will become able to express his feelings about past experiences.  This is obviously something that concerns you.  I have found a Play Therapy group who have experience of working with autistic children.  They also use play not just as a therapy to uncover emotions, they use child directed play where the child is in control of the play and the therapist complies with the child's requests and they also narrate the emotions the child expresses.  This style of play has helped my son become more confident in playing with others and given him confidence to take control and direct the play.  Narrating on the emotions expressed during play helps my son understand his feelings and what they represent to him and other people.
I think an experienced play therapist might help you tease out behaviours that are due to past experiences as opposed to behaviours that are due to something else like aspergers for example.
If you want your child to be assessed for autism/aspergers the first stop would be your doctor or paediatrician.  Ask for a multi-disciplinary team assessment by professionals who are experienced in diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders.  I think you are rightly concerned and need to know if your son is on the spectrum.  I would also advise you to read up about the condition and start to make notes of any behaviours you think your son does that meet the diagnostic criteria.
Sometimes the assessment is pretty straight forward and you get an answer from all the professionals that agrees with your feelings as well.  Sometimes you may need to ask for a second opinion.  But seeing professionals who deal with autistic children every day is very important because sometimes the charteristics are there but are very subtle.
Even if your child is on the spectrum it sounds like he is on the milder side, but getting a diagnosis is an important step in getting the right level and the right kind of supports that your son needs.  Again, in some cases the support just falls into place.  In other cases you may have to fight quite hard to get supports for your child.  That is why it is very important to find out as much about the condition as you can yourself.
If you do get a diagnosis, I would recommend getting in touch with a parent support group and also somekind of parent advocacy service that can inform you of what you and your sons rights are so that you know what kind of services/supports should be provided.
Hope that helps.

1391,Help with communication,"
        It sounds like you have concerns both about the source of your son's communicative deficits and with the diagnosis being made by your doctor without taking his hearing loss into account.  Hearing deficits in young children can translate into deficits in speech as well, so it may be that your son should not have a true differential diagnosis of autism.  You also asked about effective interventions but the actual source of his communicative deficits needs to be identified before appropriate treatment can be identified.  I would highly recommend that you take your son to a doctor that specializes in hearing loss in young children.  The exact nature and extent of his hearing loss should be identified and a specialist in this area should be able to speak to you about the expected collateral effects of the hearing impairment.  Additionally, I would recommend that you seek a second opinion on the autism diagnosis if you have any concerns about the doctors taking the appropriate information into account.  The ideal individual to make the diagnosis is a professional who has experience diagnosing autism in young children and who is also familiar with the types of impairments related to early-age hearing loss.

1392,"does child i care for have aspergers, and how to tell the parents","
        The variability of behavior and development in children usually means these problems are not “black or white.”  I think the examples of the child’s various behaviors you list are cause for concern and I understand that you feel a responsibility to communicate your concerns to the child’s parents.  I think your question boils down to how to do this in a way that won’t alienate the parents, but will move them to have their child evaluated by the appropriate clinicians.  First remember that you may be the first person to bring these kinds of concerns to the attention of the parents.  (What I said above about the variability of behavior and development in children can also be applied to the experience and approachability of parents.)  It’s not an easy thing for anyone to present information to parents regarding a concern about a child’s development.  I can tell you that I have found patience, understanding, and frankness coupled with sensitivity to be important.  Here are a couple of suggestions of how you might go about speaking with the child’s parents.  
You might want to start a conversation in a relatively neutral way.  For example, asking if the child has been seen for his regular well-child physical by his pediatrician?  Or, since he is four-years-old, has he been to his local school for kindergarten screening?  If the answer to either is no, then you might want to suggest that they schedule this (and, if you are in a position to help with this, actually assist the parents in getting this going).  If they have done either or both, that opens up a door for you to ask, in as non-threatening way as possible, what were the results? Hopefully this will allow you to add your opinion about your concerns.  You can even volunteer to talk to the doctor or school district if the parents would like you to.  
If some variation of the above suggestions doesn’t work, then you may also have the option of presenting your concerns in a written form.  If you are in a center-based preschool, do you have a system for sending home progress notes or home-log notes on children?  You might want to ask about any assessments that the child has had, or write some of your concerns that you suggest the parents might want to discuss with a child development professional.  (One note of caution here; extra care is called for with written comments.  Since you are not there to gauge the parents’ reaction to the information, it may come across to them as being more severe than you intend it to be.)  Again, instead of listing out the specific behaviors of the child you might want to invite the parents in for a meeting.  If you know of an appropriate professional to refer them to, you may want to do that as well.  
Finally, caring for a child that behaves in the ways that you describe can be frustrating, especially if the feedback you receive for the parents doesn’t match up with what you see as obvious.  Make sure you have the supports you need to remain effective and professional.  It sounds to me like that child would benefit for at least a visit to a professional who specializes child development.

1393,"does child i care for have aspergers, and how to tell the parents","
        I presume you are a nursery care provider?  Aren't there usually procedures that educational settings should follow?  I think before you speak to the parents you should find out what the referral procedures are and maybe speak to some of the professionals eg. Speech and Language Therapist, Educational Psychologist etc about how to go about informing the parents of your concern.  In the UK the Health Visitor is usually still involved pre-school.  Once you have found out what the procedures are it might be worth arranging a meeting with the parents and another professional to talk about your concerns.  Ask them if they have any concerns about him.  There is always the possibility that one of the parents may also be Aspergers, or may have some autistic traits.  I know that my family has alot of autistic traits and therefore it was hard to see what was different with my son.  In the end it was the degree it affected him that brought him within the criteria for a diagnosis.  But I can still attribute alot of his behaviours to family members!
Try to explain to them that their child may find it harder at full time school and that it would be better to find out now and get the supports needed in place before he starts school, rather than leave it until the school calls them or their son starts to get really upset.  
It maybe that he doesn't have Aspergers, although I agree that alot of what he is doing is familiar, but the fact is it is your job as the professional to raise your concerns with the parents.  
Try to understand that this will be devastating for the parents to hear.  Afterall it is a lifelong condition that will affect all aspects of the childs life.  Getting a diagnosis is not the end of the world, but it does feel like that at the beginning.  Try to get across that you are trying to do what is best for the child and are giving your recommendations to the parents.  Try to empathise with them.  Don't take it personally if they get really upset or angry.  When I was first told that my son was probably on the autistic spectrum, I felt as if a policeman had just told me that my son was dead.  All my hopes, dreams, expectations were suddenly torn away.  I was absolutely devastated and cried and grieved for a long time.  I know that's going to scare you a little to be the messenger.  But you are the first person to notice possible problems, and in future years, they may thank you for it.  Or if they don't, maybe the second or third person to say the same thing will finally sink in that there is a problem.
Tell them your concerns.  Ask them if they are happy for you to refer your son to other professionals for them to assess him, and take it from there.
No easy answers I'm afraid.

        You could bring the urination thing up to the parents.  That seems a little non-hygenic.  I guess he really has to go and doesn't understand he needs to tell you he has to go to the bathroom?  (One of my friends is dealing with their child going in the bushes and on public fire hyrdrants since he's immitating the newly acquired family dog... so I have heard stories about that type of issue.)  

If you think the parents don't want to hear the word autism, you could recommend they take him to a developmental pediatrician to have some of his behaviors assessed.  My daughter's developmental pediatrican, who we waited 5 months to have our first visit with last winter, has offered us very helpful advice on how to deal with certain behavioral issues related to PDD (autistic spectrum) and also the diagnosis of PDD.  There are also other things the child might have if not autism, but that's  for the  specialist doctor to figure out.  But you could list the behaviors and communication issues the child has, and  recommend they take the child to either a developmental pediatrician, a child psychiatrist, or even have the child assessed through the public school system (if you live in the U.S.).  If he is quite verbal, he may qualify on other behavioral issues like adaptive skills (self feeding and I guess  not going pee in public) and social communication skills (how he interacts with others).  Personally I'd recommend both the specialist doctor or psychiatrist and the school system, but sometimes the parents can't afford seeing the doctor if their insurance doesn't cover it, and the school system assessment would be free.  I think it is... I guess I will find out for certain on that one very very soon.  

I guess stress to the parents that there are lots of opportunities for the child  to learn  to  overcome his ""eccentricities"" either through therapy or child counseling and that a preschool or daycare is not trained to provide those types of services.

        It is very hard when you receive a diagnosis.  It is a relief in some ways because most mothers have had concerns for quite a while beforehand that things were not quite right.  But we are still hoping for something less serious/pervasive/not life long than autism.  But how you are feeling is probably down to the fact that you will have to change your perceptions/expectations of your child.  Throughout all of this your child has not changed, they are still the same.  But the knowledge that comes with a diagnosis means we may have to 'let go and grieve' for some things.  No professional will be able to tell you the prognosis, or how your child will develop.  I found for some time that I was having to 'let go' of expectations because he wasn't developing in those areas.  Then he would suddenly progress in other areas and almost catch up.  Someone sent me a good article about how you feel when you get a diagnosis and I put in in my journal if you want to read it.  Someone else put another explanation called Arrived in Holland (I think).  But it is very early days for you, and there are lots of parents who have walked the path before you and are there to give you support and advice.
Regarding what diagnosis your son gets.  There are a number of conditions that tend to cluster together (autism/ADD/ODD/OCD/Tourettes/Anxiety/Depression/Dyslexia/ Dyspraxia/Irlen Syndrome - to name a few!).  Some children are just one diagnosis, some are more than one, some are traits from alot of conditions but not enough to get a diagnosis in any of them.  Think of it as a fruit salad (which is how it was explained to me).  A fruit salad can be made up of one kind of fruit or a mixture of fruits, but it is still a fruit salad.
I would say read up as much as you can about any condition your son is diagnosed with.  Get as much help/intervention as possible to help support your child.  Find what support groups are in your area and find one you feel comfortable with.  As your child matures, it is not unusual for diagnosis to change or even be removed.
As far as I know all children are seen by Clinical Psychologist along with others prior to getting a diagnosis.

        Yes we do grieve, but we may still find our children exceed our expectations or their diagnosis limitations.  As they don't tend to develop in the same sequential way or at the same time as other children you can sometimes feel that they are falling further and further behind their peers in some areas, yet are way ahead of them in others.  The hardest part, from the parents point of view, is not knowing what the future will bring.  Will they be able to work/marry/have kids etc (but then there is no guarantee that a 'normal' child will achieve those things).  
My advice would be get as much support for your child as you can.  As he develops you will see opportunities for improving on certain behaviours eg. my son only recently started asking me to play with him (he didn't want it before), so he now goes to Play Therapy and he loves going.  He is now in a group of about 6 other children and they 'play' together under the observation of a number of Play Therapists who model back behaviour and help to give them better ways of interacting.

        I imagine that the professionals assessing your daughter describe her as “really tricky” it does mean that she doesn’t “fit neatly” into a single diagnostic category.  That probably means that she has some features that would contribute to a diagnosis of Asperger’s Disorder.  Because Asperger’s Disorder is a behaviorally defined disorder (i.e., there is something like a blood that doctors can rely on for a diagnosis) it does take time and, ideally, multiple interactions and assessment with an individual to arrive at the correct diagnosis.  This can be a very difficult time for a parent because of all the uncertainty.  I can only advise you to try and remain patient and hopefully the information you will gain by the careful assessment of your daughter will pay dividends in the recommendations for her educational placement and treatment.  Here is a website where you can find out more about what goes into a diagnosis of Asperger’s Disorder.  While I am not endorsing the website, it may help you to further answer some of your questions.  http://www.aspergers.com/

        Have you looked at the clinical diagnostic criteria under DSM IV for Aspergers.  That will give you a list of the things that professionals will be looking for.  If they are saying that your daughter does not tick all the boxes, ask them what it is that she doesn't have/do.  As a diagnosis can only be made after observations that is usually why it takes so long.  It took me 18 months to get a diagnosis of an Autistic Spectrum Disorder for my son and it took a further year on top of that to get any kind of support for him in school.  There is also the possibility that your daughter has certain Aspergers traits but not enough of all the things they are looking for to give a diagnosis.
I would recommend finding out what the criteria is, how your daughter doesn't fulfil it, and read up about Aspergers.  
You don't say how old your daughter is.  Sometimes things become more apparent by a certain age when some skills should be evident.  If they are missing that would indicate a problem, but prior to that age this skill maybe missing in all children.  So sometimes it can be a waiting game.
If, at the end of it, you are not happy with the outcome, you can ask for a second opinion.  But in the meantime try to find out as much as you can so that you are informed.

    1) marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviours such
       as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures 
       to regulate social interaction;

    2) failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental
       level;

    3) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests or
       achievments with other people (eg: by a lack of showing, bringing, 
       or pointing out objects of interest to other people);

    4) lack of social or emotional reciprocity.

B. Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests,

        What about PDD-NOS? Have they suggested that at all? From what I understand, that's a diagnosis when the child has some features of Asperger's or Autism, but not all. You may want to find out about that as well.

        The only other thing I can suggest is getting in touch with a Solicitor who deals with special educational needs law and asking him if he can recommend an Independent Educational Psychologist who could assess her independently.  You may need to get other professionals reports which will be expensive, unless you qualify for some form of legal aid.  It's just a thought, but it will get your problem resolved much quicker and because the experts are independent they are going to say exactly the level of support she needs rather than a state professional who will always have in mind what the state can afford.

I can only suggest that you work with your psychiatrist to determine a differential diagnosis.  A child and adolescent psychiatrist is probably the best professional to evaluate and separate the effects of any neurological problems versus the direct or side effects of medication.  Particularly since your daughter has been on a number of medications at a relatively young age, you may want to discuss with the psychiatrist getting an assessment or consultation from a psychopharmacologist who specializes in children.  Certainly some of eth other behaviors that you mentioned could be indicative of a child with Tourette’s Disorder, but those same behaviors are also common in a variety of children with developmental disabilities.  Again, working with professionals who specialize in childhood disorders is your best bet.

        In addition to head banging, does you son show any other behavioral characteristics of autism, such as delayed speech or difficulties with changes in routines? I would suggest that you try to identify a hospital in an urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children who present developmental delays. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations if they are deemed necessary. You can then take these recommendations to your local early intervention program for services.

You can then take these recommendations to your local early intervention program and public school. There is a lot of mis information out there so I would rely on the professionals who have see and evaluated your children for advice.

In the end, we treat his symptoms and try to come to grips that whatever you want to call it, he has some idiocycrises that we deal with on a day to day hour to hour basis.  For us, some medication has helped with symptoms but I worry alot about his future and other people and how he is treated.

        Thanks for the reply!!! It is just so confusing and sometimes doing a bit of self education, just seems to confuse me more.  The little guy is so very smart, but not in that ""rain man"" sort of way.  I would like to credit this to his older brother and him seeing what he does, how he goes to school and so on, also, he got a Leapster and is doing so well with it.  I am so proud of his skills, then relay them to the director of the pre-school he will go to and she dashes my pride and reduces it to fear!   She says that he should be talking soooo much more by now, nut in reality, the only thing missing from what you would term ""normal"" is the speech.  He makes eye contact, socializes, sometimes to the point that he throws a fit when we need to leave, and does communicate, although not as well as his bro did at this age.  Then to have someone tell you that becasue he is writing his ABC's, that this is a sign of Apsergers!!!  I sometimes feel that people are so quick to label and just move on!!!

1415,Aspergers or Autism???,"
        Have a look at the diagnostic criteria under DSM IV for both autism and aspergers (you can google it).  That will give you the list of behaviours they (professionals) are looking for and you have to tick a number of boxes in each category to get a diagnosis.
If it is autism, there is such a 'spectrum' of how it affects each individual.  It ranges from severe to very milld (or not enough traits to even get a diagnosis).
Usually, if there are no speech delays, (but there is other 'autistic behaviour), that points more to Aspergers, although they still do have communication and social interaction problems.  Again this can range from not wanting to initiate social interaction, or doing it in an 'odd' way or to the extreme of not understanding when another person has had enough and wants you to go away!  Children with Aspergers also tend to do better academically at school.
Children on the autistic spectrum tend to have speech delays and language processing problems.  For example they may be able to request things eg. a drink or something to eat.  But when you ask them a question you may get no response, or something totally unrelated to what you asked.  So their expressive language is better than their understanding of receptive language.
Then there will be social communication difficulties.  This may involve not understanding the social rules or the rules of a game.  Not understanding your role within a game.  Wanting to re-enact things they have read/seen on TV/DVDs and wanting others around them to also re-enact these things.  This shows a lack of imagination, but you have to look quite hard to see it because it looks like imaginary play until you see how they are rigidly sticking to the dialogue or the sequence of events that they have seen.
There are usually tantrums around change eg. change of routine, change of sequence of doing things, moving from one task to another, having to stop or start things.
For those children less severely affected with autism I believe (from my experience and that of other parents) that they can/do show eye contact/ empathy/sense of humour/ theory of mind etc.  Maybe not to the same level as their peers, but it is there.
There are usually some sensory issues eg. appearing deaf/covering ears at noises.  Tactile problems of having to remove tags on clothes or not feeling any pain at all.  They may be oversensitive to smell and taste and refuse food or only eat certain types of food etc.  But these sensory problems fluctuate and can be different day to day or even throughout the day.  This can confuse parents because they don't see the same response from their child.  Some children can only use one sense at a time eg. when they are making a lego model they appear deaf (ie. their ears are effectively turned off).
So I would suggest looking at the criteria.  Professionals usually look for the 'triad of impairments'.  This includes problems with speech, social interaction and lack of imagination.  From what you have posted you have already said he has difficulties with speech and emotional maturity (read appropriate social interaction), so there may be difficulties in two of the three areas and professionals will want to observe your son to see if he can demonstrate imagination.  Some children can show some imagination, but it is whether it is to a level consistent with peers.  
Even if it does turn out that your son is on the spectrum it really is not the end of the world (although it feels like it is at the time).  He sounds like he is doing really well.  So, although the diagnosis is devastating, it means he will get the support he needs within school.  Or it may turn out to be some delays, or even some traits of autism, but not enough to meet the criteria.  Speech and Language usually do a good job in recognising the speech/communication difficulties associated with autism and maybe able to tell you from their report whether they suspect autism.  But it will probably take alot of further observations for other professionals to confirm that.

We are older parents and have raised five children already but the challenges of these two sons can be overwhelming. We are living in Southeast Georgia and we haven't be able to find schools that can meet our sons needs.  We are planning on relocating to North Carolina.  We are checking into the Morganton area near Ashville.  It has been hard finding out information about schools etc. The boys have extreme behavior disorders, their last two pyschiatrist have suggested we will need to place them in residential care soon.    We are middle age caucasions and are raising two african american sons so we want to consider how they will be accepted in the community also.  I have tried to research residential care schools that would accept the. so that we can still be involved in their lives.  Can anyone give us some information/advise in these areas, location, schools, mixed family acceptance and residential care facilities in North Carolina.

1418,Does my son have asperger syndrome,"
        First of all you need to go to the school administration and complain about the teacher's behaviors.  I assume your son has a disability diagnosis since he is on medication; if not you should make an appointment with a developmental pediatrician as soon as possible and have him evaluated and diagnosed.  You also need to inform yourself about disability law and the rights of students with disabilities.  Then I would be in touch with your school system's counseling services to see if they can provide your son with counseling on effective social skills.  If the school system does not have such services contact your pediatrician and see if he/she can connect you with behavioral health services that can work in group settings on social skills.  I would also contact local advocacy groups in your area informing them of the behavior of the school staff and see if you can't arrange some basic sensitivity training for the teachers and the school system.  Your son cannot advocate for himself but there are laws against discriminating against students with disabilities and if you find out the teachers are not being sensitive to his issues and helping him you need to intervene quickly and assertively.

        My heart goes out for you, I know only too well what you and your family must have gone through! As the mother of an 11 year old who has similar problems I realize the issues here.My advice would be to change the school, give him a fresh start. We've changed schools and this has helped to remove the'label', he still has those tiffs with other children and feels that no one reaiil likes him. What really breakes my heart is that I have an extremely gifted 8 year old daughter who always gets extra attention and adulation from adults and children alike. As a parent I feel TORN.
Hopefully, by the time they become adults, there will be more awareness about this ailment.

1421,Does my son have asperger syndrome,"
        Does your son have a diagnosis of Aspergers?  If not I would recommend you to look up the clinical diagnostic criteria under DSM IV.  You may find that your son fits enough of the profile to get a clinical diagnosis.  
Part of the charteristics of Aspergers is having a limited range of interests and having special interests in some subjects/topics/hobbies.  They show an incredible amount of knowledge in these subjects but tend to want to 'talk to' people about them regardless of whether the other person is listening or not.  This also shows a lack of understanding around social interaction/communication which is another trait of Aspergers.
Is he being called lazy because he cannot function in class, or produce homework on time, or cannot organise himself?  This can also fall under Aspergers and also Executive Function Disorder.  If there are sensory issues please post back.
How your son is being treated at school is disgusting and unacceptable.  Do not feel ground down by them pointing the finger at you and your son/family.  I would recommend you to send a message to MJthewriterdad as he is in the US and seems to know alot about how the system works there.  But it is absolutely disgraceful that a child with learning/social difficulties is being verbally/mentally bullied by a member of staff in front of his peers.  
Gather up all your strength, get some advice, get someone to be with you in any meetings as a witness and advocate.  Put your grievances in writing and get your son evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team through Health if that has not already been done.

        Hearing that your pediatrician has concerns about your child’s development is upsetting but you should take these concerns seriously. I would suggest that you try to identify a hospital in an urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children who present developmental delays. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations if they are deemed necessary. You can then take these recommendations to your local early intervention program for services.

1423,No Diagnosis Yet,"
        Of course there is hope, and bathtubs loads of it.  What your child is doing now is really positive stuff.  Any concerns by your pediatrician or yourself need to be followed up.  But every child is uniquely different.  Your child may be on the autistic spectrum, or they may have some developmental delay, or they may have some traits of autism or another disorder.  But he is interacting with you and that means a much more positive outcome whatever happens (even if it is autism).  Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means that the child/adult can be affected severely or mildly (or anywhere inbetween).
At the moment you are worried sick at the prospect that your child is not 'as you expected' and the implications for the future that that holds.  But with time, as you learn more about your son you will see that he too will develop and learn and achieve things, you will feel more positive about the future.
At the moment you are just at the start of a very scary journey, which as you have said also makes you angry/sad and frustrated.  But lots of other parents have done this and are doing it, so you are not alone.
If it does turn out to be 'something' I would recommend finding a parent support group because you will get lots of information and emotional suppport.

You're right. I guess when I see all of the babies around me babbling away and being ""normal"", I can't help but feel a little cheated of what I feel I ""should have had"" in a child. It's not that I love him any less, because I don't. He is my heart.
But being around other people with kids who are clapping and babbling and doing so many things that he isn't is enough to send anyone over the edge...especially when I'm not even sure what the problem is yet. The ""wait and see"" game is unbearable when you know that every day that goes by without therapy is a day wasted.
I am trying to stay positive, but it's like a light switch flipping on and off. I can be positive one minute, but the next I get so frustrated...then feel guilty about it!

Anyway, thanks for your input and advice. I appreciate it!

1425,No Diagnosis Yet,"
        Every parent who has a child with any disorder will know what you are going through.  I would recommend that you just enjoy him and try not to 'play catch up' all the time.  It's very tempting to try and do it all yourself, but at the end of the day, having a good, fun time with your child is very important.  I tried to help my son keep up with school work, to no avail on my part, and tears and tantrums of his part.  I know it is frustrating when you feel that every day is a day lost in therapy.  But again these children can tend to develop at different times and tend not to develop across the whole range of a skill, so for example with speech they may be good at expressing themselves but have very little understanding of what is being said to them.  
You most likely will have times when you grieve for the child you thought you had.  But it is a strange feeling because on the one hand you feel like your expectations are shattered.  Yet, on the other than your child is happy/healthy and you wouldn't change them for the world.  I liken it to a merry-go-round.  I have periods when I feel okay and then I have times when I step on this merry go round of emotions.  So you are allowed to have a good cry, pick yourself up and get on with life.
As every child is affected by whichever disorder in their own unique way, I would start to become a bit of a detective.  Watch his behaviours and what he can/cannot do and try to find out what could be the root problem.
The evaluation process takes a long time, and it will involve lots of observations and paperwork, and you will need to become a secretary and make sure that everything is co-ordinated.  Make sure you always put things in writing and get written responses and file them and keep them for years!
For where you are now, probably the first service to become involved is Speech and Language Therapy.  I am not sure if it is this service that can teach signing, but you could find that out.  Starting with some signs will help reduce your child's frustration at not being able to communicate his needs, and it won't delay any spoken language, it will just help support it.
As he may have sensory issues I would recommend reading an article published in Autism Today by a woman called Olga Bogdashina.  If you google her name it will bring this article up.  She has conducted seminars in our area and this was arranged by our autism outreach department.  Her book Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers also has a profile checklist at the back that can give you an indication of how your child is affected.  Many professionals in our area are asking parents to complete this questionnaire about their children.  So, for example, your son may have problems with texture, taste and smell.  My son is affected in all senses, but mainly tactile and auditory sense.  Once you know that it will explain alot of their behaviour.
The book also explains about different learning styles from an autistic point of view which is very helpful.
To be honest, I don't really notice my son's difficulties so much at home, because it is simply how he has always been.  But as you say, when he is at a party I notice that he is different.
You don't mention anything about tantrums.  I know he is very young, but how does he handle change or you moving his toys or turning the TV off, or taking him to another place etc?

1426,No Diagnosis Yet,"
        He doesn't have tantrums at all. Unless you count the crying fits that he has when we leave him alone to play by himself. I can be in the kitchen where he can see me from the living room and he will sometimes play for a bit, but usually stands at the gate and cries for me (or dad) to come back. Once we're in the living room, he shuts up and will even go back to playing. I interact with him (some days more than others) while I'm in there, but sometimes I'll just read or watch TV on the couch and he's fine. This is what makes me believe he doesn't have Autism...that he's just delayed in some areas.  He HATES to be left alone for too long. He LOVES the interaction of people. He is more interactive with other babies when we're indoors as opposed to being outside. He doesn't particularly like the feel of grass or mulch that you'll find at the park (another texture thing?).

I'm just not really sure what's going on with him. Like we both said, there is a huge umbrella under which ASD lies. So it could be that he has a touch of it, or that he is simply delayed. As I said in my post, I wonder if it has anything to do with the hard birth and lack of breathing when he first arrived. The doctor who responded to my post  didn't answer that, so I have no idea.

I will definitely keep track all documents regarding his difficulties and will try to start a written journal of his progress so that I can be more aware. This is my first child, so I don't really know what to expect from him at different ages.

Thanks again for your help!

        It may be, as you suggest, some sensory issues and some autistic traits.  But I would get an evaluation and keep track of everything.  It is a positive thing if he wants you to be around and interacting with him.  Alot of parents usually say their child was very independent and could occupy themselves playing with puzzles/legos etc to the point that you wouldn't know they were there.  Other children tend to 'demand your time and socia interaction'.  But I would also say go with your gut feelings and get it looked at to put your mind at rest and so that any supports your child needs are in place for nursery/school.
I think you are never really going to get a definitive answer about the delivery.  I too had a difficult delivery with my son and had a severe infection afterwards with antibiotics etc.  But, so far, there is no definative explanation of where autism comes from.

        My daughter is really extreme.

I am looking forward to her finishing school so I can find help for her AS and  Obsessive conduct. Depression, high sensitivity to touching, social issues, motor skill issues are still there, however, the worse is the progressing OCD behavior. 
I must find a doctor and I wonder what kind of doctor would be best for her, we have seen several in the past and she does not cooperate at all.
She has lost a lot of weight during the last year ( eating little and exercising daily), she says to feel a lot of anger if she does not exercise.

        I am a bit concerned reading your post because the 'eating little and exercising daily' may be the sign of an eating disorder.  Given the other things going on ie. AS, OCD, Depression, lack of sleep (2-3 hours?) I think it would be wise to go your doctor and maybe ask him what referral would be best.  It may be that you need to see someone who specialises in AS (because of the difference in the way those with AS think) for them to advise on who would be best to address the other difficulties, but I am not sure.  I just feel that it sounds like there are issues around stress, anxiety, depression, control etc combined with a brilliant (perfectionist?) mind that can sometimes lead to a kind of downward spiral.

        Children are incredibly resilient. Difficult situations at home can certainly set children back, but I have seen many children “catch up” with the right kind of support. So, I would encourage you not to focus on the past, but to focus on what you and your child’s school can be doing right now to help her in any of the remaining areas of difficulty. It sounds like your child has some wonderful strengths. It is important to recognize and build on those, but also to make sure that you are challenging her to develop in other areas as well. Given the large discrepancy between school and home, I recommend that you try to work closely with your child’s school and any service providers to encourage appropriate social behavior. It certainly sounds to me that your child has some age appropriate play, language, and social skills. If you are questioning the diagnosis, I recommend seeking the input of a local professional who is experienced in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders.

1440,"My child dignosed as ASD, but I doubt about it","
        Definitely go to an expert.  I have a team of the best psychiatrists, psychoneurologists, and psychologists looking at my son and they are a bit stumped whether he is ASD or not.  He is what they call very borderline.  He is very smart.  His IQ is in the 98% - but htat really doesn't matter when you lack social kills.  He reminds us of Sheldon on the big Bang Theory.  

Am I upset that ehre is no definitive answer - not really.  We know his executive functioning is in the toilet and he has a very rigid vieew of the world - but all the ABA therapy we have down with him has worked wonders in our ability to function as a familyy.  He is definitely improving.

And all of those big reports all those doctors wrote - got us into a school were the staff was professionally trained to dela with his persosnality both emotionally and academically.

Many of the children in his school are exceptionally bright - but many still have trouble functioning when they graduate.  In fact, his school has just set up an agreement with a college so tht the supports are still in place if they want to attend college (ASD hava high dropout rate).

After three years, no one can definitely dx my son.  Right now it is technically ADHD, ODD, tic disorder and an unspecified mood disorder.  Many of the autism doctors feel that he is a little bit autistic but not full blown criteria,.  NYU is starting to move into researching this whole borderline area of children -- she just may be one of them.

My son almost has pragmatic speech down (he is good 90% of the time), is getting better at controlling his emotions when things aren't going his way, and is learning to be more flexible - but it si a process.  Be happy that she seems relatively normal - the more normal she is the better chances at a good outcvome.  My son never qualified for any services until we sued the state - and he was struggling so bad that we were afraid he was turning suicidal.  He had a bad incidence on Prozac - leading his psychiatrist (who specializes in Asperger's but is also a pharmacologist) to start thinking along different lines (as certain conditions react badly to SRRIs).  THese are what experts can help you sort out.  He may be bipolar (too young to tell),  but these are things they can monitor.

Now he is in a place that celebrates him.  They work on his strengths and his weaknesses.  He is so happy now that his anxiety levels are way down and he has made friends.  We truly thank all the professionals at the NYU Child Development Center that built the roadmapp for us to follow.  I think that the scope of some children''s problems need a professional who sees more of it than your average pediatrician.  Our pediatricians are kept informed but they acknowledge that it is best to get expert advice.  

It truly disturbes me that so many people on these boards rely on quicly done psycho-eds at their school or a quick checklist at the doctor's office.  There are definirely waiting room diagnosis (in my son's school they abound) but I am finding the more we get into this that there are so many shades of behavioral issues or neurological disorders.  What one parent regards as autisitic my actually be the symptom of many other conditions - or it may be autism.  THe dx isn't always as important as getting the right therapies for your child.  ASD gets you alot more help than ADHD or ED - so take it as a gift.  You can always have the paper work shredded when your child ages out of the system.

        We homeschool our Aspie and we're not the only ones. My son is still in the elementary grades and so we buy his curriculum and have it sent to us but it is much better still for high schoolers. There are programs such as is offered by Keystone Highschool, where the student logs on and completes high school and college credit courses entirely online.

Plus most U.S states also have distance learning programs where they have to supply you with curriculum, help and grading.

School was too over-stimulating for our son and it lead to lots of meltdowns and general unhappiness.

Good luck with whatever you decide:)

There are of course other means, requiring a bit of persistence and litigation on your part.  ad news - it is about a year before they give you any money and you have to foot tuition bill.  You ned to talk to your school psychologist - that is the starting point.  You need to hire a child advocate - they usually work on a sliding scale.

1444,Asperger's Obsessive Behavior,"
        My 8 yr old son develops obsessive interests in one particular thing and that is all he wants to talk about.  We have been through collecting Halloween decorations, Christmas decorations, different series of books, webkinz and now we are on to the Titanic. It is all he wants to read, watch or talk about. Whatever the obsession of the moment it, replaces any other topic of conversation with both family members and friends.  What can I do (if anything) to change this obsessive behavior? 

There is surprisingly little research on this particular characteristic of autism. So, the literature does not provide much guidance. I can, however, offer some general suggestions based on my clinical experiences. I think our tendency with all children is to encourage obsessive interests by purchasing every available item related to the interest and centering our own conversations about the interests. At the same time, we fail to encourage the children to develop new interests because we are offering a more restricted range of experiences. We often unintentionally contribute to food selectivity in the same way. Do your best to expose your child to a variety of experiences and to reward trying new things.

        I personally do not see a problem with Aspies' obessions, unless they are totally inappropriate.  I don't agree with the Doctor on her answer either.  What is wrong with getting into the child's world and experiencing their obsession with them?  In fact, you MUST do this to ever truly reach & connect with an Aspie.  (FYI--in school, the teachers that practice this are the ONLY ones who have been successful with my daugther.)  How can we expect them to come out to our world when we refuse to visit theirs?  In an NT world it is great to expose your child to different things & have it work out.  In an Aspie world when you expose your child to different things it USUALLY ends up a disaster.  Like you have said, Connorsmom, their obsessions change--they find other interests on their own.  
Helpmommy--it is difficult finding friends that are interested in the same thing, especially in their grade.  Their interests are usually in line with kids either older, or younger, than they are, so you are going to have to look outside his age group for playmates.  This is VERY typical of Aspies (to hang with people outside of their age group).

1448,Asperger's Obsessive Behavior,"
        I agree with the other comments.  Children on the spectrum tend to be able to put all their focus and attention into one thing at a time.  Obsessions can be a good way of teaching other things simply because they are interested in the subject and therefore can concentrate for hours.  So, for example, Thomas the Tank Engine can be used to teach colours, numbers, shapes, relationships, facial expressions etc etc.
Sometimes these obsessions actually turn into future jobs and expertise.  I don't think anyone can beat an Aspie on info on their pet subject!
If it is a case of trying to help the person understand the limit of anothers interest in their pet subject, then you can use social stories or get them to time themselves.  Ie. after 5 mins non-stop talking on your pet subject ask the other person if they want to hear anymore!  But even NTs can be just as bad as someone with Aspergers.  I have frequently been cornered by someone at a party who just liked to talk.
But a hobby, interest, obsession can be a good way of getting them to socialise eg. join a music club, a quiz team etc.
I understand it can be irritating to us sometimes, but that is when we have to teach them some social cues.  And I agree with the other posting that we shouldn't always expect them to fit into our world, why not enter theirs' sometimes?
There are many parents out there who have non-verbal autistic children and any kind of communication would be wonderful for them.  Count your blessings.  Tell your child when you've had enough and can't listen to anymore, but say they're really great to know so much!

        The teacher found him annoying - that is why our child goes to a school for Asperger's children where the teachers actually like being with ""annoying"" children.  They have a shelf for him where his Bionicles sit and wait for him.

Having said that - he has learned over they years to keep his obsessions to himself (he is 9).  I think that is the key with social training.   THe obsessions don't leave - but they can become a more private, family affair.

Right now we have moved on to roller coasters.  Did we give in?  Sure - we have a season pass to Six Flags, we are going to build a 7 ft. tall roller coaster in the living room this summer, and we are buyting Roller Coaster Tycoon3.  I secretly think theat companies like Lego and K'Nex have rooms full of Asperger's people working for them.  Is it all bad?  No - we will learn all about the physics of a roller coaster and building is such a quiet activity.  The great thing about obsessed Aspie's - they don't need you to help with the instructions.  Don't you love it when your kid can build any lego set -  but ask them to tie their shoes?  Someone explain that to me?

Now, to the advice about branching out.  I totally agree.  We don't let him have his obsessions until his homework is done.  I make him read books that he doesn't want to or experience things he doesn't want to before we reward him with his obsessions.  

His doctors are amazed - when they see what he can academically do considering his level of executive dysfunction.  He has a high IQ but a difficult personality - he doesn't like interacting with alot of people and he would rather read all day - but e are really tough.  We were taught great ABA strategies and though we felt like prison wardens instead of loving parents, he has learned to do what people want most of the time without too much grumbling.  

We have moved from Harry Potter like novels to George Orwell and Dickens (he is 9) and with that we can talk about other things such as religion and politics.  we make him watch the news and documentaries.  It is a struggle - but he is becoming very versatile in his conversations.  But, he is a bit unusual for an Asperger's type, he has strong inferential skills - but the doctors attribute that to his voracious reading habits.   

It won't always be Thomas the Tank - but best to develop a worth while obsession and not encourage another one.  He wanted to start collecting Transformers and we said no - Bionicles were enough.

        Couldn't you just throttle doctors sometimes!  If he is embarrassed about it you are right to think he isn't doing it for attention.  Sounds more like tics to me than OCD.  Wherever you are I think you should ask for an assessment through Health, because whether it is tics or OCD it could get worse.
Sometimes hand flicking near the face in the line of vision can be an indication of autism.  But you haven't raised that as a concern so I assume there were no speech delays or communication problems or throwing tantrums or sensory issues?

        Sally thanks so much for your reply, I think you are right about it being more of a Tic, I have been looking around the net heaps and it seems to fit better. 
I have OCD myself and just thought it was that. 
My older child went through a period of having a vocal tic as well as some odd movements after he had a Bone graft for his Cleft Palate, so I should have realised, but the two are so different and I just didn’t see it. 

He doesn’t have any delays at all but does have some difficult behaviours I have spoken to my other son’s (younger than the other two) Early Intervention Teacher some time ago with his other odd behaviour. She feels he has something like Aspergers but isn’t’ qualified to say.  
I was just beside myself with worry when I posted. I think though we can deal with Tic’s and it does seem to be settling down. Well he has adapted them to smaller movements, and the hyperventilating has changed to whistling. Oh it’s so hard for him, but easier I’m feeling like I can deal with it now. So now it’s a matter of getting into Mental health and finding the best way to support him. Can you tell I feel so much better lol 
Mental health would like us to see the Pead to rule out any medical reasons for his behaviour. 
So I’m off to find another Doctor it’s a 3.5hour drive both ways for us to get to another Doctor so not at all easy

        It is quite possible to have traits of different disorders, but not enough of any of them to get a full diagnosis.  As it sounds like there are a number of things running in your family (as there are with mine), I think it would be wise to get a full evaluation through Health.  The main thing I am thinking is that if he doesn't get a diagnosis because he doesn't have enough symptoms, it might be the case of trying some stress/anxiety reduction or control techniques because alot of what you mention OCD, Tics/Tourettes, Aspergers are all high anxiety disorders that get worse with stress.

        Have a look under DSM IV for the clinical diagnostic critera for Aspergers.  You could also look up the criteria for Schizo Affective Disorder and compare the two.  If Aspergers sounds like him then he could get an evaluation, if that is what he wanted.
If he has ADHD or Aspergers and has had difficulty with reading/writing it is worth looking up Irlen Syndrome.  This is something that alot of children with dyslexia/Autism/ADHD have.  It can be helped tremendously just by wearing a pair of glasses with Irlen lenses.  The eyes twitching sounds like a symptom of Irlen Syndrome.
When you say he doesn't have any guilt.  This can be an autistic trait called lack of 'theory of mind'.  If you have difficulties understanding other peoples actions and intentions you also will not be able to understand the outcome of your own actions.  If you cannot see those connections then how can you feel guilt?  You need to be able to make the connection between what you have done, the repercussions of your actions on yourself and other people to have guilt.
It is quite common for those with Aspergers or Autism to get involved in petty crime (or just continuously get into trouble) because they cannot predict outcomes.  So if their friends tell them to do something they will do it without understanding what will happen.  So, for example, a group of boys may tell the autistic child to kick the football.  The other children know that there is a good chance that the ball will break one of the windows.  The autistic child cannot forsee that.  So he kicks the ball, breaks the window and gets into trouble.  The other children may think this is a great laugh to have someone so naive that they can get them to do anything they want.  The autistic child will not understand that they are being used and if they cannot predict outcomes they won't know when to say 'no' or when to say 'yes' to their 'friends'.
Those with Aspergers and autism can be extremely sensitive and have an emormous amount of feelings.  It is usually the fact that they cannot control what they feel or handle how overwhelming they feel that they can have tantrums.  My son has autism and when he gets very upset he says that the feeling/emotion totally floods him and he cannot get it under control.  This may last for quite a while, so they need to learn ways to help calm themselves down.  We tend to experience our emotions in proportion to what has happened and we can quite quickly get our feelings under control.  It is not like that for them.
I don't know if that helps or not.  It is quite possible to have some traits of Aspergers or Autism without having enough of them to get a diagnosis.
There are also a number of conditions that tend to cluster together either within families or within individuals eg. Autism/ADHD/Bi-polar/Dyslexia/Dyspraxia/Developmental Delay/Learning Difficulties/Mental Health Issues/OCD/Touretts/OCD/Anxiety etc etc.

1457,Cannot retrieve information from memory,"
        It sounds like the problem you are facing with your son is that he is able to correctly answer questions given some cues but not others.  In other words, given just a card with the word “tree” written on it and the prompt “what does this say?” your son might not be able to answer correctly whereas, if he was three different cards with a different word on each and the prompt “which one says tree,” he would be able to answer correctly.  An effective way of dealing with issues of this kind is to treat them as specific deficits in learning and develop educational programming focusing on teaching him to respond correctly in these particular situations.  A variety of prompting and prompt fading strategies have been shown to be effective in teaching children who display behavior patterns similar to your son’s to be able to correctly respond in situations where they initially have difficulty.  Typically, in a training program of this sort, you might start in the situation in which he does answer correctly.  For example, you might start with one card that says “tree,” one that says “car,” and one that says “fence.”  You might ask him what the “tree” card says and if he doesn’t reply in five seconds say “It says tree, what does it say?.”  Here you have arranged two prompts.  The first is representative of the situations your son has more difficulty with and the second is one that he is likely to respond correctly to.  The trick is to teach your son to respond correctly to the first prompt get rid of the second prompt.  This usually requires there to be a sufficient source of motivation and a gradual fading of the second prompt.  For motivation, I recommend using your son’s favorite movie, activity, snack, etc…  You might arrange things so that he gets to watch five minutes of his favorite movie each time he responds correctly to the first prompt.  This might look something like the following.  

You ask him “what does this say” pointing to the “tree” card.  If he answers correctly, allow him to watch the movie for five minutes.  If he doesn’t answer correctly in five seconds, you say “it says tree, what does it say?”  If he answers correctly, you wait another five seconds and start over with the first prompt (“what does this say?”).  If he gets it right this time, he gets to watch his movie, if not, it’s on to the second prompt.  If he doesn’t answer correctly to the second prompt in five seconds, repeat it.  

By arranging this sequence, he only gets to watch the movie when he responds to the more general prompt and can get a lot of practice answering prompts of this sort.  A good method for fading out the second prompt is to increasingly delay it.  In other words, after the first prompt (“what does this say?”) he might have to wait 10, 20, or 30 seconds for the more specific prompt.  Training procedures like this conducted with sufficient frequency (for example, for a half hour a day) can be quite effective in teaching children with challenges similar to your son’s to respond correctly in contexts in which they typically have difficulty.

1458,Cannot retrieve information from memory,"
        My understanding is that they are using that type of system at his school at the moment.  But he still isn't getting it.  Even when we use something that motivates him he doesn't seem to be able to retrieve information and he gets very upset about it.  Sometimes he gives up trying to tell us something because he cannot access the words.  He says 'they float around in my brain'.  I don't think I would be able to use the motivation of the TV (although he loves TV), because if I had to stop him every 5 minutes he would have a meltdown every time and it usually takes him a fair amount of time (over an hour) to recover.
If that is the only type of thing that works, then I suppose we'll have to continue with that.  But I wondered if there is a specific problem that some people with autism have of not being able to access information regardless of the fact that he knows it.  There are times when something triggers information he has stored.  It might be something I say or something he sees and then he is like a recording and just replays an amazing amount of information.  But when he has finished and you ask him about it, he seems as surprised as everyone else as to how he knew that!
I wondered if he really doesn't recognise things 'visually', (and he isn't a visual learner) but somehow when he is given a choice of things he is able to bring in his ability of 'pattern recognition' to help him identify the correct answer?

1459,What can I do if my son has autism spectrum disorder,"
        You are correct that repetitive behaviors (e.g, handflapping), delayed language, and social impairment are characteristic of autism. Of course, a qualified professional would need to conduct a thorough assessment to diagnosis any disorder. Given your concerns, it is great that you got some help in his younger years. I have no doubt that this contributed to his current academic success. It seems that your biggest current concern is interview skills. Perhaps there are some resources available at your son’s college that would help to prepare him for an interview in his chosen field. Often colleges and universities have a career center that provides these resources. In addition, it may be useful to contact the college office that oversees accommodations for individuals with disabilities, as they may have additional resources that may be helpful. Although a diagnosis can be helpful in obtaining services, often a diagnosis does not provide much information about how to address these deficits. Like many college students, I suspect that your son would benefit from (a) getting some help with building a resume, (b) learning about the format of most job interviews, (c) role playing interviews, (d) receiving constructive feedback on his interview skills, and (e) perhaps watching his role-played interview on video to assist in self-identifying desirable and undesirable interview behavior. Many college students gain entry into a company through internships. Often interns are screened less heavily, and internships allow the company to sample the interns’ skills. If you son’s difficulties are mostly with the first impression (the interview), an internship might provide a foot-in-the-door.

        I presume your son doesn't have a diagnosis at present?  Have you talked about it with him.  Would he like an evaluation and would he find it a positive experience to understand where some of his difficulties come from?  If he is on the spectrum that can sometimes be a bonus to getting a job.  I was on another website and a man with Aspergers (who had decided to 'come out' with his diagnosis), had just got a job specifically because of the positive characteristics of Aspergers.
But I agree that you/he may need some information/help on how he should approach interviews.  I think if your son gets a diagnosis it would help him to highlight his strengths in his C.V.

        Your son's age is one that can be particularly difficult even without having to handle the challenges that your son seems to be facing.  It sounds like your son is on medication that has been successful to some degree but not completely successful and that he is in counseling that you are not finding effective.  Behavior therapy alone or in combination with medication can be effective in treating tics associated with Tourette’s syndrome and the types of behavior problems that you are describing.  If you are finding the medication to be insufficiently effective, discuss plans for alternatives that might be more successful with your doctor.  If you are finding the counseling ineffective, I recommend finding a certified behavior analyst with experience working with children similar to your son.  It sounds like your son is quite bright and could benefit greatly from a well designed treatment program.  Children with the challenges your son is facing can be effectively treated.  As a parent, I believe that the key is to find a therapist/behavior analyst with a track record of success in treating similar behavior problems (feel free to ask for data from previously successful treatments that he or she has overseen).

        Are there any dinnertime clubs at your son's school?  If not, is this something that the school could start.  Your son might be able to be involved with it.  Maybe a club around an interest of his?  He could then 'help' other children learn how to do whatever this club is about.  This was very successful for a friend of mine whose son is Aspergers and who was finding social interaction very difficult and was getting teased/bullied.  Because these children need structure and routines it is frequently forgotten that there is no structure of support during 'free time' at school.  
He does sound very low as well.  Do you use Social Stories with him at all?  I agree with the other comment that we need to stop this 'stupid' self assessment thing all the time.  My son can also do that at times and call himself stupid, a loser, useless etc.  Remember that autistic/aspergers people are very 'honest' in their choice of words.  So if he says he is stupid that is how he feels and how he is interpreting his performance.  They also tend to use words literally.  So counteract that by saying 'stupid means ....., getting water on your towel is not stupid it is an accident.  
If he has any areas of interest try to get him into those types of clubs.  If there are any parent support groups where the children meet and socialise then go along to that.  I have found a brilliant one in the next town to me.  It is for children with Aspergers, Autism/ADHD and their siblings and friends.  It is held once a fortnight at the local community college and they hold it in the gym.  They get out all the equipment plus a trampoline and bouncy castle and they have 2 hours to let off steam.  They are supervised.  Parents meet in a separate room for tea/biscuits/chat/info finding/should to cry on etc.
Try to chill out on the finer details that drive us all up the wall.  They are very picky about stuff and they cannot be hurried along.  I too get my stess levels through the roof and afterwards I haven't achieved anything by getting so wound up.  
So try and get as much positive/self esteem building stuff going on as possible.  Praise every single little thing he does and make sure you frequently tell him how wonderful he is and how much you love him.
Adolescence is a tough time (I can just about remember that far back), but he has got alot more on top of that on his plate.  As he has such difficulties with social communication is there any professional from an educational perspective who can spend time with your son maybe helping him to navigate through the social structure more easily?  We call them Social Communication specialists and they are different from Speech and Language Therapists.

        It is important for you to know that, independent of a child's diagnosis, there are behavioral interventions that are very likely to help. A diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome increases the likelihood that you will observe behavioral difficulties, but that does not mean that you need to live with those difficulties. Understanding that children with Aspergers experience the world in a different way is important. But, we also have a responsibility to work with children toward more socially appropriate behavior. I recommend that you seek the advice of a qualified professional who can help. The website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) provides a directory of service providers.

1467,behavior problems,"
        I think you are right and alot of the disruptive behaviour is down to Aspergers.  But that doesn't mean it is acceptable.  What it means is that he may need structure and supports to help him behave as well as structure and support so that he has different options other than a meltdown.  But I would also say that even adults with Aspergers have meltdowns and I remember one adult had posted his fear of having a meltdown and of being approached by a policeman.  He said that if, at that point of anxiety/stress, the policeman touched him he would probably retaliate and hit him back, with the obvious consequences of that!
You are right to say that breaking routines/rituals is going to cause a meltdown.  For them the world is quite a chaotic place with no understandable connections.  That is why they like routines/rituals because it them makes them able to predict what is going to happen.  If you change it they are again thrown into turmoil of not knowing what is going to happen.
I have heard of a system called 123 magic, which alot of families have used successfully for 'normal' children and those on the spectrum and with ADD/ADHD.  It provides the structure so that they can navigate through difficulties behaving more appropriately and it concentrates on rewarding and reinforcing positive behaviour instead of just punishment for bad behaviour.  The child with Aspergers needs to know what the boundaries are and the other family members (including other siblings) need to know what are the difficulties of Aspergers.  For example if your grandson has problems with transitions he needs the structure so that he is able to accept that the TV programme he is watching has finished and now it is someone elses turn to watch it.  If he has rituals/routines/obsessions then these have to be worked with.  You cannot try to stop/remove them because that will cause anxiety/stress/meltdowns etc.  So if a sibling is playing with something involving his obsession and it is driving him up the wall, the sibling has to know that is a no go area.
My son, who is on the spectrum, also explained to me that when they get emotional about something they are totally flooded with that sensation.  We are able to experience that sensation in relation to what has happened we are not completely overwhelmed by an emotion out of proportion to what has happened.  Secondly my son says he cannot stop the feeling.  So where we can quite quickly get our feelings and behaviour under control and therefore act appropriately they cannot.  It is overwhelming and it doesn't stop for a long time.  So, any effort he makes to control himself should be praised.  He should be shown some empathy eg.  I can see you are really upset/angry about ..... and I think you need some time to calm down.  Then they can have 5/10 minutes in a quiet place.  This is a different approach to being told you are naughty and are sent to your room.  You are recognising the difficulty and showing him how to cope ie. go somewhere quiet to calm down.  Then later you can talk about it with him and can use Social Stories to explain the situation because many times what we understand automatically is not obvious to the child.
Don't get too upset about words he uses (although he should be made to understand what words are unacceptable through social stories again).  When he says he hates you he is just speaking his mind without the social/communication insight to know how hurtful that is to you.  Most other children would also think those words, but know that it is socially inappropriate to say them.  But listen to what he says to understand the depth of what he is feeling as that will be an honest expression of how he is experiencing the emotion.

        Great post, Sally!  I have to ad that my sister-in-law (not diagnosed, but Asperger's runs in the family) was pulled over by a police officer and she opened her car door & kicked him you know where!  My daugther, who is Aspie, has to go to a school outside of our district because they couldn't handle her, and is driven there by the school's van.  Yesterday she had a substitute driver who didn't know a thing about Asperger's and right away my daugther told her what she was doing ""wrong"" (out of the normal routine).  The driver took it as ""this kid is an obnoxious brat"" and reacted by telling her, ""I'm the driver, I can do what I want!""  Which, of course, threw my daugther into a borderline meltdown because the driver refused to do it the ""right"" way.  Aspie's are not trying to be disrespectful when pointing things out--it is just obvious to them what is right and wrong (or routine), they can't figure out why everyone else doesn't see it the same way.   A good book to read to get an understanding of how these people think and feel is Freaks, Geeks & Asperger Syndrome by Luke Jackson (a teen with Asperger's).

        Hand flapping and other types of stereotypy are common in children who have developmental disabilities regardless of whether they have autism. If you are concerned about your daughter's diagnosis I would suggest that you identify a hospital in an urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children who present developmental delays. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations. You can then take these recommendations to your local early intervention program.

        My son hardly ever hand flaps, infact I only see it about once a week.  But he did use to spin as a toddler.  Apart from hand flapping your daughter could be showing signs of echolalia.  This is when questions/phrases said to the child are repeated back by the child.  Delayed echolalia is when a child repeats DVD/TV dialogue either to themselves or uses it as a form of communication.
My son also gave answers to questions 'off topic'.  This was (a) communication disorder - he simply did not know what I was asking him but knew I was expecting an answer from him.  So if we were reading a book and I asked him 'what is the man doing' (answer: washing the car), my son would say 'it is red' (the colour of the car in the book was red).  Or he used an echolalic response to my question.
My son also has empathy, sense of humour, theory of mind, appropriate facial expressions (although maybe not to a level of a 'normal' child).
It is quite possible to have autistic traits, but not enough of them in all the areas required for a clinical diagnosis.  But I think you do need to mention your concerns to professionals.

        It might help to look at the 'clinical' diagnostic criteria for autism.  Find out which you use if you are in the states.  Or you can look at DSM IV 299 for criteria for autistic spectrum disorders.  I think it would then be useful for you to go through that with an appropriate professional to identify which parts of that criteria your daughter might fit.  Take with you a list of behaviours you have noticed with your daugther that you think are autistic and also list your concerns.  It is quite possible to have several autistic traits, but not enough of them in each criteria to reach a diagnosis.  But where your daughter does match the criteria eg. speech/social communication, then they could use the same strategies they might use for an autistic child.  
When my child was first assessed by Speech/Language professional she told me straight away that with that kind of speech problem it is usually autistic spectrum disorder eg. not understanding pronouns (I, me, you, she, he, his, hers, they, them etc); difference in receptive/expressive language (expressive language at age 7, receptive at age 3) and echolalia.  However it took 18 months in total to get a diagnosis because the only way to find out if they are on the spectrum is to watch them over a long period of time.
Does your child have any problems with transitions (moving from one activity to another at home or in school/having to stop watching TV.  Does she play with toys in the 'normal' way and not play with bits of toys.  Does she talk to herself and giggle or re-enact/repeat things she has seen on TV.
When you say she speaks off topic to you mean she gives the wrong answer to the question or does she talk alot about certain topics that she is interested in regardless of whether it is relevant or whether anyone else is interested.
Does your child have any 'over emotional' responses to things you think are quite trivial.  She she get upset/angry for no apparent reason.  When she plays with other children is it 'alongside' them but not fully interacting with the other children in the game.  Does she have problems understanding the rules of the game or having to change her role within the game.
If, having spoken again with professionals (I believe your Paediatrician and through school) and your daughter does not fit all the criteria for any condition then I think you could ask under which diagnosis would her traits 'fit' and ask for supports relevent to those traits to be used in school.

        A side effect of Paxil is decreased sexual interest or trouble with sexual functioning, so this may be the direction that your doctor is going with this medication.  Masturbation and increased sexual interest are very common at your son’s age, so what you are experiencing is not atypical.  I don’t know your son, but I get the impression that he is quite high functioning if he is able to speak with you about this.  I wouldn’t be surprised if it would be possible to solve this problem without the use of medication.  For individuals with autism-spectrum diagnoses who are less sensitive to social contingencies, public masturbation is not an uncommon problem and these individuals can often be taught where and when it is and is not appropriate to masturbate.  I recommend that you contact a behavior analyst who has experience developing programs designed to do this (http://www.bacb.com/).  These interventions might involve your son earning a particular reward each day (or perhaps each hour) that he does not touch himself in school.  This might be combined with teaching him an appropriate place for masturbation (e.g., the bathroom at home) and what places are inappropriate (e.g., in public, at school, etc…).  Interventions of this sort can be quite effective in the absence of medication but, again, I recommend that you meet with a behavior analyst and discuss interventions that would work for you and your family.

1481,Adderall and Anxiety,"
        Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts) is a stimulant that is commonly used to treat ADHD.  Nervous habits can be a fairly uncommon side effect of Adderall, however, this is commonly something like skin picking or nail biting.  I can’t be certain that the increase in perseveration that you are observing is a function of the medication but, if you are concerned that it is, make sure that you bring this to your doctor’s attention.  There are a number of medications that might be used instead and you and your doctor need to make sure that your son is on the medication and dose that is providing the maximal benefits with minimal side effects.  If you aren’t happy with the effects, address your concerns with your doctor and try a different dose or a different medication.  

I would also recommend that you look into behavioral treatment for your son as well.  Research has shown that behavioral interventions alone and in conjunction with medication can be effective in treatment of hyperactivity.  If you decide to try this, make sure that you find a therapist/behavior analyst who has experience treating ADHD with individuals similar to your son.

1485,risperdal  withdrawal,"
        It sounds like you are saying that your son was having involuntary movements while on Risperdal, he was tapered off of the Risperdal, and you are seeing behavioral effects of removing the medication (i.e., him seeming very angry).  Shaking of the hands and fingers can be a side effect of Risperdal.  Tardive dyskinesia is also a very uncommon side effect.  Some side effects decrease over time or can be decreased by decreasing the dose, eliminating the medication, or through the use of another medication.  Tardive dyskinesia is a side effect that may not go away that involves involuntary body movement, especially of the mouth and tongue.  Make sure that your doctor is aware of any side effects and, if these movements continue, I would recommend seeking out a specialist in treating involuntary movements.  Involuntary moments or withdrawal dyckinesias may also occur when Risperdal is quickly tapered.  These usually appear within one to four weeks of lowering the dose or stopping the medication.  Withdrawal dyskinesia usually goes away over time but it may take days or months.  Cessation of the medication can also be accompanied by emotional disturbance (irritability, nervousness, moodiness, or oppositional behavior), increases in problem behavior, stomachaches, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, indigestion, trouble sleeping, trembling, or shaking.  These problems associated with withdrawal can last between a few days to a few weeks.  Make sure that you let your doctor know if any of these are observed.

It is not possible or appropriate for me to make specific recommendations about such dangerous behavior in this format.

        Thank you so much for your advice and support. It was a very good meeting with the therapist. She really seems to know her stuff and gave us some good strategies. Needless to say our daughter will be seeing her weekly for the forseeable future. Mainly it gave us hope and some structure and guidance that we sorely needed. And, thankfully (hope I'm not jinxing myself) I think the stresstantrums is (we are praying) losing some steam. The therapist says it will get worse before it gets better, but that that is a sign we are making progress. She also says we'll have to determine whether it is more anxiety issue or more behavioral issue (or I suppose it could be a combination.) I'm just going into detail here so that maybe this could help others going through the things we are. Also she recommended the 123 Magic program, and coincidentally we are reading that very book! Does anyone have any thought about this book/program? It seems to make good sense and dovetails with a lot of what we see working out there (including some of the techniques seen on ""Supernanny."") Anyway, this forum has been a lot of help and we greatly appreciate the input and support. Bottom line: we love this kid and we will move heaven and earth until she is okay and happy.

        The social difficulties that you describe are consistent with Asperger’s Disorder, but an accurate diagnosis can only be made through assessment by a qualified professional. Therefore, I recommend that you seek the assistance of an individual who specializes in the diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorders. From my point of view, diagnosis is primarily important for identifying appropriate services and supports. Diagnosis alone does not dictate the appropriate intervention. Therefore, my recommendation is for you to work with school personnel on a plan to improve your son’s social skills and to decrease problem behavior. I recommend that you seek the support of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, who would be able to conduct the appropriate assessments and to assist in developing a behavior plan. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers.

        Wow - you have a nice school.  My ASD kid sat in the principal's unlocked bathroom (he is gluten sensitive and was having a diarhea bout - he did ask the nurse to call us before it all escalated) for 2 hours (no one called us) and they called 4 cops and an ambulance to take him away.  We got a fabulous settlement which is paying for his private Asperger's School.

What the doctor says up top is very important.  My son's dx is still up for debate.  We have had ADHD, OCD, mood disorder (NYU doesn't give out the bipolar until later teenage years), ASD and Tourette's.  Honestly I couldn't give a hoot about the dx - we just needed to ascertain the services he needed.  We still have no real idea - he is just a kid who skirts alot of spectrums but fails to make full criteria on any of them.  The new school made all the difference and we are so grateful that these trained professionals (outside his large staff at NYU) know how to bring out the very best in these kids.

        Its very true what you say SueNYC.  It amazes me sometimes that in school they appear to be unable to 'think outside of the box'.  Many times I feel my son's school is more autistic then he is!!
To: Dansmum.  Alot of the things you mention sound familar from an ASD point of view.  If he takes things literally and is allowed to do something one day he will not understand why he can't the next day.  This is basically a change in routine/expectations and is usually one of the big difficulties those with ASDs have.  
If he is having alot of problems during unstructured social times eg. dinnertime/playtime etc are there any dinnertime clubs/playtime clubs that he could go to?  If not the school should be asked if they could set up something.  I know the examples of behaviour given sound extreme from our point of view, but if you see it from the autistic point of view there is usually a reason for it however 'over the top' their reaction has been.  
When my son was at nursery I was called in because he was screaming and wouldn't stop and had locked himself in the toilet.  Apparently their 'system' was to go with any child to the toilet to 'watch' them.  My son doesn't like being looked at.  He told them not to and they ignored him.  With hindsight, the simple solution would have been for them to turn their backs to him!  
As your son is 8 and verbal have you had a talk with him about it, encouraging him to explain to you what happened from his perspective.  I am not condoning bad/violent behaviour, but I think if he is able to give you some insight you will probably be surprised at his honesty.

        I agree and think you should continue to seek professional help and raise your concerns with professionals (write it down beforehand if you have a number of things to remember).  It is quite possible for a child to have 'traits' of a condition/s but not enough to get a diagnosis.  Sometimes you do have to play the waiting game to see how your child develops.  It is difficult to do this, but if your child has difficulties in certain areas it will become more evident because those defecits will have a knock on effect with higher functions for eg. a child at 3 may have a speech delay, play alongside peers, appear shy.  By age 4/5 speech may be showing more classical difficulties eg. problems with receptive language, still plays alongside peers/doesn't initiate social interaction.  By age 6, when child is expected to become more independent at school it may become apparent that they have problems with planning/sequencing/predicting outcomes/no understanding of time etc.  From a developmental point of view there are times when children acquire certain skills and, as they are not expected to have those skills prior to that age you can only wait and see how they develop.  It may be that overtime your child is progressively moving away from a diagnosis of autism, or it may be that over time things become apparent that enable professionals to give him a diagnosis.  But the most important thing is to get advice and support for difficulties he has now, and to continue to raise any concerns you have.

        There is going to be no easy answer to your problems but I do agree with other responders that you need to get your daughter screened and evaluated by people who are knowledgable about both Asperger's and behaviorally-based services.  Applied behavior analysis remains the best documented treatment strategy to date for people who have these kinds of behavioral and emotional issues; however, your daughter should also be evaluated by a developmental pediatrician or pediatric neurologist and or a psychiatrist with experience with disorders that lie on the spectrum to support or rule out that diagnosis. These professionals should also be able to provide you with information about alternative treatment options that exist in the UK.

        She could have Asperger's Syndrome (which is on the autism spectrum & appears as the behaviors you describe), and if the people around her do not understand it, or understand her, it would cause her behavior to be even more unmanageable.  Please research Asperger's Syndrome yourself and see if it sounds like your daugther.  If it does, you need to get in contact with professionals who understand it as well, and get her away from people who do not understand her.  There are online forums for people with Asperger's, like wrongplanet.net, that you could also read to get a further understanding of how they think and feel.  Good luck to you.

        As well as looking into Aspergers have you looked at Oppositional Defiance Disorders?  There is also a school (Sutherland School, Nottingham, UK), who also talk about Pathological Demand Avoidance, as being another category of autism.  This school can also carry out diagnostic assessments.  This sub-group tend to be quite capable on some levels, and can be manipulative, violent, devious (eg. involving lying and quite complex avoidance behaviours).
I am not a professional, but I have an autistic son and I think there are alot of things that they are not supposed to be able to do because of their diagnosis which they can do.  For example they are not supposed to have 'Theory of Mind', but my son can lie quite convincingly.
But with autism there is usually alot of frustration on their part because they are struggling to function and navigate themselves through our systems.  But I am sorry that you have found yourself at this point with no real answers.

1499,Hitting herself,"
        You are thinking about this in exactly the right way. In most cases, we find that self-injurious behavior is a form of communication, especially among children with limited appropriate communication. Therefore, the long term solution is to work to increase your daughter’s communication. Be sure that you have the support you need to work toward more appropriate communication. A speech therapist and/or early intervention specialist would be able to provide some general recommendations. As your child works toward developing more appropriate forms of communication, it is important not to accept self-injury as a form of communication. If you accept self-injury as communication, that is how she will communicate with you. If you require more appropriate forms of communication, you will begin to see those more frequently. Regarding loud noises, two approaches seem warranted. First, it would be helpful to teach your child to communicate that she would like to be removed from the loud noise (e.g., sign “finished”, say “all done”). Second, she will need to learn to tolerate noise so that she can participate fully in typical activities. One strategy would be to teach her to communicate that she would like to be removed from the noise and then to have her wait for brief periods before honoring her request (e.g., “OK, we can be finished in 1 minute.”). 

Some self-injurious behavior is not uncommon at 2 years, even for typical children. But, it is important for you to make sure that you child is safe at all times. Be sure to discuss this issue with your pediatrician who may be able to recommend some appropriate local services.

1500,Hitting herself,"
        My son also used to scratch his face, hit his face, bang his head, vomit whenever he got upset about something.  This is a communication problem both ways.  They find it hard to communicate with you and they cannot understand what you are saying to them.  Encourage short one/two word phrases together with signing or pictures.  A large part of the behaviour is their frustration.  Now my son is older and verbal and can tell me what upsets him and how he feels.  Interestingly, he also says that when he feels bad/upset/anxious etc that he cannot control it and stop feeling it.  So in some way they get flooded with their feelings and find it hard to bring them under control as well do.  But they do learn to cope better as they get older.
Having a predictable routine will help.  There may be problems with transitions eg. moving from one toy/subject/room to another.  Your child may be unable to do something, cannot communicate her need for help and therefore hits herself.  Or you could be asking her to do something/stop doing something and she cannot understand/comply.
Regarding sensory stuff, google Olga Bogdashina and read her article in Autism Today.  My son also has alot of sensory stuff, we have been referred to OT.  I have had him assessed for Irlen Syndrome and he wears the glasses which help alot.  I also have a pair of DIY ear defenders which he uses to screen out noise.  The problem with noise could be that it is loud/sudden/unpredictable or noises she cannot habituate to.  The glasses/ear defenders have given my son confidence/trust to do many things eg. go shopping etc.  As he is getting older (age 7) I always ask him if he needs them, but he is quite capable of refusing them.  If there is too much sensory stimulation this too will cause meltdowns.

1510,How early can a child be diagnosed with Autism?,"
        Unfortunately, most children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are still not identified as having an ASD until they reach 6-8 years of age.  However, we do know that children younger than one year of age can be diagnosed with an ASD.  Maestro and colleagues have conducted several studies reviewing home videos of children's first b-day parties wherein they have looked for behavioral markers for autism.  They have then followed these children over time and found that those diagnosed with an ASD showed early signs of autism, even those who were noted to lose skills or regress.  That implies that regressive autism may be more apparent than real in that autism is present but not recognized until after the child loses some skills.  The regression is identifiable but the child also had signs of autism before regressing.

Noticeable things that most children seem to just do, are absent and need to be taught to children with autism, such as looking directly at others (eye contact), following the eye gaze of others and gestures to learn about the world (joint attention). 
The number of diagnosed cases of autism is on the rise and the Center for Disease Control estimates that the rate of autism is as high as 1 in 150 in 8 year old children (CDC, 2007).  Research has shown the most effective outcomes occur when intensive interventions using Applied Behavior Analysis are begun as early as possible,  preferably before age 4 (Howard et al., 2005).  Therefore it is very important to identify autism as early as possible.  All pediatricians should screen their patients for autism and should refer their patients for formal testing if they suspect autism. 
  
Towards this end, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a report which included guidelines for pediatricians which suggest that all infants should be screened for autism at either their 18 or 24 month well visit.  As described by the American Academy of Pediatrics report, early indicators of autism in children younger than 2 years of age include: extremes of personality such as extremely irritable or extremely quiet, absence of the child looking directly into caregivers or siblings eyes, the child not turning and looking when their name is call by a parent, or the parent needing to call the child’s name several times prior to the child responding, the child being more interested in playing with toys than playing with the parent, lack of babbling and lack of smiling while looking at the parent.

As a parent who is concerned that your child may have some of the early warning signs of autism the most important step you can take is to talk to your with your pediatrician about your concerns.

1511,How to stop bowl accidents,"
        I strongly recommend providing some reward for bowel movements on the toilet, if you are not doing this already. Rewards may include a favorite snack or access to a favorite video or other activity. Use something that you reserve only for bowel movements. With some children, it is helpful to use a bin full of fairly inexpensive prizes such as those that can be purchased at a dollar store or party store. Have this bin present in a visible spot, and allow your son to choose a prize whenever he has a bowel movement on the toilet. It may be necessary for you to have your son spend some time in the house without pants or underwear so that he can experience the rewards for having a bowel movement in the toilet. After he has experienced this success, have him wear pants. Hopefully, this experience will motivate him to use the toilet. Also, if you see any signs that he is about to have a bowel movement (e.g., straining, seeking privacy), have him sit on the toilet and keep the rewards in view. In my experience, it is fairly easy to fade out rewards once your child begins to use the toilet in a routine way.

        I would suggest that you go try to identify a hospital in an urban area where they specialize in diagnosis of children who present developmental delays. A comprehensive evaluation by a team of specialists will result in diagnostic information as well as treatment recommendations. You can then take these recommendations to your local early intervention program.

        I found a book called ""Sensory Perceptual Issues in Autism and Aspergers"" by a woman called Olga Bogdashina very useful.  It is quite written in language you understand, but it is complex and sometimes you have to read over what you just read.  But it all made sense of the behaviours and responses I was seeing in my child.
At the back of the book there is also a long questionnaire which you can fill in to find out your childs sensory profile.  Again this is very useful because you can then see which sense is affected the most etc.  There are a number of professionals in the UK using this profile checklist, so I am confident that it is reputable.
Your son is still very young, but I still think you would be able to get a profile.  I completed it for my son and found that all of his senses were affected, but that his main problems were auditory and tactile.  I go over it again once a year to update it as obviously children change.
As well as explaining the sensory differences and how they interact, the book also goes over some coping strategies these children use either intentionally or automatically.
Eventhough you don't say your child has a diagnosis of autism, I think this book would still be relevant to children with sensory problems and no diagnosis.
I'm afraid I have no experience of hypotonia or hyperopic.
Hope that is useful.

        The most effective treatment for children with autism is early intensive behavioral intervention. This means that your son should receive 20 hours of direct teaching in language, social skills and self-help skills. Services can be provided by early intervention or the public schools in your area. You may want to look for behaviorally trained professionals to supervise a treatment program by checking www.bacb.com for a person in your area.

        Bedtime problems are common among children with developmental disorders and typical children alike. I agree with many of the recommendations already provided. A consistent bedtime routine is almost universally recommended to promote smooth transitions to sleep and to facilitate sleep once the child is in bed. It is also important to minimize day sleep and to have a fairly regular wake time. Have the child’s parents check with his pediatrician to be sure that the scheduled amount of sleep is appropriate. There are many functions of a sleep routine. One function is to make it clear when sleep time is approaching. Once the sleep routine is initiated, it is important to follow through and make sure that the child is in bed at the scheduled time. When caregivers allow a child to “bargain out” of sleep time by asking for a few more minutes, one more show, or a snack, children are successful in taking control of situation and in delaying sleep. Once, the child is in bed, it is important to minimize interaction that would interfere with sleep and potentially reward calling out, leaving the bed, and other disruptive behavior. Given the severity of the bedtime protests that you described, I think it is important for you to get some professional assistance. I am particular concerned about the use of restraint. It is important that caregivers use restraint only when absolutely necessary and that the use of restraint is approved and supervised by a qualified professional. I strongly recommend that you seek the assistance of a local Board Certified Behavior Analyst. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers.

        I would suggest implementing a consistent and predictable routine to follow starting after snack.  (1. Snack 2.tv 3.book 4.brush teeth 5.bed or something like that depending)  Kids in the autistic spectrum do well with routine and structure.  
I also suggest giving some sort of positive reinforcement for him complying with the routine.  Look into what is motivating and enjoyable for him.  For example, if he complies with step 1 of the routine he get a sticker.  If he gets 5 stickers, the next morning he can play the x-box (or other motivating activity)  for 20 minutes.   If he does not comply, no x-box.  This is just a general idea but you would need to modify it your situation.
In terms of additional training for you, I would look into Behavior Interventions for children with autistic spectrum disorder.

        Risperdal has been shown to be successful in treating tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome.  It is good to hear that the medication seems to be having at least some beneficial effect.  As some of the individuals responding have mentioned, it is important to be working with a doctor who has experience treating this disorder and there are also some behavior therapy options that have been shown to work.  The one that I have seen the most empirical support for is called ""habit reversal.""  This, essentially, entails teaching an individual to be aware of when the tic is occurring and giving them a competing response to engage it (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing.  I highly recommend pursuing seeking out clinicians and therapists who have experience working with children similar to your own and incorporating a “training” component into the treatment for the Tourette syndrome.

        I have two children with Tourestte's - one with Asperger's.   My dad has Tourette's.  I had Tourette's as a kid - the tics aren't the big deal - the underlying problems behind the tics are.  They see doctors that specialize in Tourette's.  My children's tics did not start until 5 or 6.  My son's tics which involved hand licking and sniffing pretty much disappeared by 9.  My daughter had throat clearing and also a hand lick.  The throat clearing is gone but the hand licking has become a rare event.  It hit its height and is now on the wane.  My non-AS daughter hada real doozy - she had a three month tick of a quick touch to her vagina - you should have seen the school officials lose it over that one.  We were like - ""get a hold of yourself, she is 7 you people are 40.""  We had to have her psychiatrist explain to these public school ""trained professionals"" that the OT's have it all wrong and that it isn't a sensory intergration issue.  That misguided finding came out of one badly done study that has been totally repudiated but they forgot to update the OT's textbooks.  And that is why people need to bring their children to reputable Child Study Centers and stop listening to out of date school professionals.  By the way, the tic mysteriously disappeared after legal action was threatened and they laid off of my poor kid and stopped stressing her.  My 7 year old other tics are on the wane right now.  If she would only stop reorganizing and cleaning all the time I would be much happier.

Generally, at this age, you ignore the tics.  You need to think of the tic as a variation of OCD behavior.  The tic is something that needs to be done so that the individual has a feeling of ""rightness"".  When the child is old enough to get the sensation that the tick is about to happen then habit reversal training can be attempted - that is usually around 11 or 12.   Most tics come and go and my son's has pretty much resolved themselves but still will occasionally re-emerge when he is feeling stressed.

As far as medication goes, Tenex is my drug of choice.  Not only does it help the tic, it helps your little one fall into a restful slumber.  We like Tenex alot.  ALso. really helps as a mood stabilizer.

Buspar is also pretty effective.  It is a pretty good bang for the buck as far as anxiety drugs go.  None of my children were medicated before the age of 6 - so if I were you I would visit someone especially trained in giving prescription psychotropic drugs to children.  My brother used a regular psychiatrist for his children - and let's just say the man triggered off hallucogenic delusions in my brother's six year old.  A child psychiatrist couldn't believe the cocktail that the other doc put into his kid.

We are generally a family of OCD, anxiety ridden people.  Goes back at least 4 generations.  Tics are actually fairly more common than most people believe.  I mean, check out roger Clemens during the hearings.  His tic was in full steam - which I happily pointed out to my kids.  

Good luck,

        My son (7 years old) has what looks to be tics. He clears his throat incessantly, sometimes 20-30 times in a minute. He also shakes his hands and crosses his fingers, which is worse when he is anxious. He also developed a facial tic but only when he eats/drinks Splenda. The pediatrician said he thinks the throat clearing is related to allergies, but so far allergy meds and shots haven't helped. I have put him on Omega-3's and that has helped somewhat, but not totally. Do you think this could be tourettes? He is highly intelligent for his age, obsessed with numbers and math. Could it be a form of OCD?

1525,Asperger's and Tourette's,"
        My son was diagnosed with Tourette's when he was four. His tics have changed over the years, waxy and waning in the usual pattern. He currently has a shoulder shrug that leaves him is lots of muscle pain by the end of the day. An eye tic, shifting his vision back and forth constantly, makes it difficult for him to concentrate at school. The eye tic occurs two to three times per day and lasts about 15 minutes. The shoulder, neck rolls seem to be pretty constant. He gets relief for a few minutes at a time. He is 11 years old now. 

He's been diagnosed with the typical trio, TS, ADD (he isn't hyperactive, but diffinitly has attention deficits), and OCD. 

Two years ago he was also diagnosed with Asperger's. He fits most of the criteria. Social rules sometimes confuse him, and he has difficulty with picking up the nonverbal messages most people clearly understand. His interests are narrow: Star Wars, Transformers, and SpongeBob mostly. I hope the fixations will mature with him.  

Therapy, especially social skills training, over the years has been tremendous help. He actually plays football with the boys at recess now! He's been in speech therapy to help with understanding the pragmatics of language, spoken and written, for several years. He also sees a child psychologist who is working with him to find ways of dealing the the tics, OCD issues, and social concerns.

His MD is not a trained psychiatrist, but someone who has gained expertise working with children with neurological disorders because of special interest in the area. We've not tried Tenex yet, Risperdal has been helpful in increasing our son's social behavior, in combination with all the therapy. He is also taking meds for anxiety and attention. 

I would strongly encourage 'pinkhair' to provide her son with lots of social skills training. I agree with SueNYC that the tics can be dealt with through educating others, and your child about the syndrome. People are much less kind to those with Asperger's. The long-term effects of not understanding social rules can be devastating. We are amazed at the social growth of our son, and hope that, eventually, he will be able to have fulfilling, long-term social and career relationships.

By the way, it is really nice to find a site where discussion of the two syndromes is going on. I've searched several times for information about comorbidity of TS and AS, but haven't had any luck until today. Thank you all for sharing your knowledge, and experience.

        This is a very difficult situation.  However, I assume some agency or school system has hired you to provide specific services to this child so I would contact my supervisor and share this information to see if there is any way you can get support for more parental involvement.  It really depends, I expect, on whether you are expected to provide educational services or respite/custodial services.  Good luck.

        Wow.  This sounds like a tough case.  If this child's mother is not on board with what you are trying to help this child learn, then it is a no win situation. My best recommendation to you would be to get his ""team"" together to discuss what is going on with him.  If that means the case manager, mobile therapist, or whoever is involved, they need to know and discuss this.

Another idea is for you to see how his school is handling his behaviors.  It should be beneficial for both home and school to deal with this boy's issues in the same manner.  Children with autism thrive in consistency.  If his mother sees that they use a schedule in school, she may be more likely to implement that at home.  Same may go for dealing with behaviors.

        I agree with what everyone else has said about a multi disciplinary team meeting about how to get family on board.  But mum may be tired, and trying to change routine may seem to big a hill for her to climb.  She will need the plan explaining and will need to be confident of support from all the agencies.  Afterall any change in routine may not be accepted by the child for a long time.  Even if it is possible for the child to reach these goals there is always alot of anxiety and stress around change for children.
Regarding communication through pointing at visual pictures.  Can you try to do it starting from visual pictures for things he wants/needs/likes first.  Always work through any interests the child has and on what communication problems are causing him the most frustration.

        That was the point. She was seen by a Developmental Pediatrician, and he noted that she had joint attention, affection, and good eye contact, therefore he ruled out Autism. I am asking for another opinion of these symptoms, and asking if others agree that good social skills rules out PDD-NOS.

I know she has a language delay and requires speech therapy. My observations are that her language delay seems identical to other children who are diagnosed with autism. For example, 1) Her receptive language and auditory processing is inferior to her expressive ability, 2) Jargon and echolia are present, and 3) She regressed at age 1.

        My son turned three in January and was recently diagnosed with high functioning autism spectrum disorder.  The paediatrician wanted to wait till he was three before we assessed him for ASD because he too gave eye contact during the Dr visit and paid attention to the Dr.  I could not wait this long because it was haunting me every day.  I arranged for a psychologist assessment who specialises in autism and preferrs to diagnose ASD at an early age.  She conducted the first part of the assessment at his childcare setting and then spent time with us to discuss his history and characteristics.  She informed us at the end of the session of Reillys diagnosis.  I was both relieved and emotional but I know it was the best thing I could have done because the Dr had no problems with providing a diagnosis after reading the psycholosist report

        I too had concerns about my son from 2+.  He didn't have that explosion of language at 2-3 years old.  He was putting a couple of words together.  He didn't seem to ask questions about his surroundings.  We didn't chat.  He used language mainly to ask for things or to tell me things.  He had problems with transitions.  If I took a toy off him or tried to move him onto something else he would get so upset that he would vomit.
At 3+ my daughter was bought a TV and from the moment he saw his first video he started repeating the dialogue.  I was told at nursery that he wasn't joining in with the other children and wouldn't comply with instructions.  He was repeating TV dialogue alot and was also using it to form his speech (this is delayed echolalia).  Anyway I sought professional help and was told not to worry.  
When he started school things did not go well.  I had told them of my concerns.  He had never picked up a crayon and would scream if I tried to make him draw or colour.  He was (and still to some extent ambidextrous).  He didn't cope in school.  He was banging his head on the table/wall.  Hiding under the table and refusing to come out.  He was repeatedly walking up and down the classroom and showing other repeitive behaviours.  He would roll himself up on the mat and refuse to come out.  He was a very unhappy little boy and it broke my heart to have to take him into school each day.  
He was referred to the speech and communication clinic.  He was finally diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder with severe communication disorder (including echolalia) and sensory differences.  He is now 7 and has made alot of progress.  He still finds pronouns difficult (you, me, she, he, his, her, I, etc), he tends to mix them up.  He is verbal and uses his own speech and he also uses phrases from TV used in their emotional context.  
My biggest breakthrough was in understanding the sensory problems.  I read a book called ""sensory and perceptual issues in autism and aspergers"" by Olga Bogdashina.  In this book I found an explanation to the behaviours my son was showing.  His aversion to having his hair/head/ears touched, brushing teeth,, cutting nails wearing socks etc all made sense (afterall if it hurts him to do these things he is going to try to avoid them).  Why he appeared deaf sometimes and then ran from the room at other noises, covering his ears etc.  
The book also has a questionnaire at the back that you can complete to get a sensory profile.  A number of professionals are using this checklist in the UK so I know it is reputable.  From completing this I found my son is mainly hypersensitive in all his senses, but that they can fluctuate and by hyposensitive.  His main problems are with auditory and tactile senses.  
He mainly functions through one sense at a time.  This has a huge impact.  For example if he is listening to me he cannot look at me and he may lose awareness of body sensation.  If he is making a lego model and I speak to him it forces him to switch from tactile/visual sense to auditory sense and this can cause him to lose his place in the sequence of what he was making.  
Now that I can see and understand that, it has made a huge difference as to how we do things at home and at school.
Although I do agree he is autistic (not Aspergers due to the language difficulties), and he does have some autistic cognitive traits, he actually does quite well socially.  He tends to prefer adults (children are too unpredictable and not very patient) and he is mainly passive (lack of confidence in social interaction leads him to not intiate contact).  But if he is approached he will play quite happily.
I have found Play Therapy very useful in helping him gain confidence in play and also learning to allow other people to direct the story instead of always having to keep control.  He now asks me to play with him every day.
My point in all of this is that it is called a 'spectrum' for the reason that there is such a wide difference in abilities across all the areas affected by autism.  No two people are the same.  I don't want to scare any of you about the possiblity of a diagnosis.  But my son does have imagination, empathy etc (and so do many other high functioning autistic people).  He likes to snuggle up to me in bed.  He tells me he loves me.
If you do get a diagnosis it is not the end of the world.  You will grieve for the child you thought you had (but infact they haven't changed, just your perception of them).  They will have difficulties (but so do all children), and they will have achievements.
Good luck to you all.

        My father in law is 70 & went for most of his life undiagnosed as Asperger's. It was not until we moved in to care for my mother in law that we made the link ourselves. Two of his grandsons were diagnosed, 1 with autism & 1 with asperger's but there aer family members still quite erluctant to believe it could be possible. Prior to this we assumed he had some kind of depressive disorder as he had been out of work, and out of the community in many ways for a long time. Also, because he was a mathematician, his behaviours were just considered 'eccentric' by his children & wider family but never really questioned - he has very set routines about reading set numbers of pages in multiple books at a time, and has read some books hundreds of times, etc.
I think though that it could be quite difficult for adults being diagnosed later in life because there can be a lifetime of pain & confusion prior to the diagnosis, which i do at times see in my F-in-Law. At this stage i think there is a great deal of interest in assisting asperger's children to grow & become adults able to live with success in the wider community (now that there is some understanding out there) but maybe its less so for the aging community who have already maybe been through a lot in their lifetime.

        I had those problems too as a child.....every one of them,and I don't have Aspergers Syndrome.  I have no problems with understanding emotional/social cues.  My mother told me as a baby...when I was doing something wrong,she would give me a look and I would stop dead in my tracks.  My problem was that I was always hypersensitive,highly emotional .....I was very shy too.....so that affected poor social interaction........besides having speech problems and coordination problems and children calling me retard....well that took away my self esteem.   

Dyspraxia and Aspergers tend to have overlapping symptoms like sensory integration issues.  the main thing is that Aspergers have problems understanding emotional/social cues. Another thing is that speech delays rule out Aspergers....but not autism.

        Delay in communication is a key component of an autism diagnosis and early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) has been shown to produce clinically significant outcomes.  I would highly recommend identifying an alternative professional with the appropriate training to make the diagnosis and looking into early intervention.  Most schools that offer EIBI will also be able to recommend someone to evaluate your child and you might find that the waiting list to recieve services is also quite long, so I recommend identifying and contacting appropriate service providers as soon as you are able.

        I think you do have a cause for concern.  Children with autism show impairments in speech and language skills, impairments in social skills and odd or restricted behavior and interests.  Who did you schedule an appointment with, a doctor?  Your best bet would be to contact your local school district and request an evaluation to see if your child is eligible for special education services.  In PA, the district has 60 days to complete the evaluation.  I believe the federal law is 90 days.  That would be better than waiting 6 months.  You could call the district to find out the name of the person who takes such requests for a child who is 2 years (Early Intervention?).  It is better to put your request in writing.  Make sure that there is a Psychologist, Speech Therapist, Occupational Therapist, and a Special Education Teacher submitting information for the evaluation.

        You have listed several of the key warning signs of an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  The M-CHAT is a screening device that is designed for easy use by nurses in pediatricians offices in order to decide if referral of a child to a specialist is needed for possible ASD.  The M-CHAT is designed to screen for Autism Specturm Disorders in toddlers (over the age of 12 months, and ideally over the age of 18 months.) A parent can complete the items independently. The M-CHAT does not anyone making a diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder, but it is a very useful clinical tool that has excellent sensitivity and specificity in order to make a referral to an expert. 

The M-Chat is available online in a variety of places but a self-scoring version is available here:
http://www.utahfeat.org/site/mchats/new

School districts, under IDEA, are not required to serve children until they are 3 years of age.  If your child is close to 3 then contacting them and expressing your concerns about their needs may result in testing prior to 3 in order for the district to prepare to serve them when they turn three.  Most states have Medicaid funded services for 0-3 year olds that is designed to serve kids prior to their becoming eligible for public school special education.  Contact your state's Autism Society of America chapter to look into this option and for recommendations for those who can evaluate your child - 6 months is 25% of a 2 year old's life and its WAY too long to wait.  Every major research report on Autism treatment indicates that early intervention is essential.

Hope that helps.

        I'm just going to add that ASD is not a death sentence. Early intervention is a good way to start. Also keep an open mind. Some things can be worked on, but others you will have to accept as part of what makes your child who they are.  If you're curious to know what to expect in the long run, you can read some of my journal entries and my posts on the forums.

I've been dxed with PDD nos at age 6. Earlier dxs were severe mental retardation of some sort (and with a warning to not expect me to graduate), then Autistic like... 

Anyways, not only did I graduate high school, but I graduated top 10% and had a couple years in college. Most of my childhood, I went without medication either. It goes to show what can done if given the right support.

        I am sorry to hear about the number of difficulties you are encountering.  The issues that you are facing are, unfortunately, not uncommon for parents of children with autism-spectrum diagnoses.  Let’s start with the medication.  There is some evidence that medication can help with problem behavior emitted by children with diagnoses similar to your son’s.  That being said, it is very important that you are working with a doctor you are comfortable with.  If you don’t like the decisions being made, seek out another doctor.  Good choices are those who have experience with individuals that have your son’s diagnosis and who have experience successfully treating problem behavior with medication.  In addition, while there is some evidence that medication can help, the most effective solutions have a teaching component as well.  The most proven approach to treating severe behavior problems is Applied Behavior Analysis.  There is certification for therapists practicing behavior analysis and you can search for one in your area here http://www.bacb.com/  Again, you would be looking for someone with experience dealing with the type of problem behavior that your son is exhibiting.

        Same boat over here! Concerta (18mg) worked well for about a year for my son. Age5 to5 1/4 was like night and day the minute it hit his system. When his defiant/aggressive behaviors started to increase again, they added Risperdal (1.5mg).
Now the unpredictable behavior is on the move up once again. His doctor won't listen to me when I say ""ASPERGER'S"". Due to many relocations (expelled from 6 daycares and 2 kindergardens...the last move was to prevent expulsion from 3rd grade) he has only seen this particulare doctor for 6 months. She doesn't know any more than his records tell her, since she met him when his behavior was moderately in check. Truthfully, he can't make it through breakfast without his pills--and neither could I! My advice to you is this: DON'T LET THEM IGNORE YOU! You are his mother, and without a medical degree you still know what he needs better than they do. Scream loud and clear HELP MY SON! If they still offer less than necessary assistance, ask them just who is reasonsable for the damage he causes himself or another while they aren't effectively treating his DISABILTY? Rock the boat and get them wet-or they'll just go through the protocal motions of seemingly treating your son as an individual and not a statistic.

        Let me help you out I have a son that was told everything you was told, but one difference I have a great doctor that lets me decide what i ned to give him. My son who is age 11 to was on concerta 75 and he too was getting aggressive. I had them lower the dose it made a world of difference there is another type of ritalin out there it is called methlyn. I nottice when they lowered the dosage when he came home in the afternoon he got a small dose of methlyn. You know what else I did I took him off the concerta on the weekend it made him angry, aggressive, moody, argumentative and he didn't want to be out side. Once I took him off the concerta on the weekend he plays with other kids he doesn't talk back. Another thing that worries me about your son being on that high of dose is does he think of suicide. He may not tell you but ask him. My son when he was on that high of a dose took a knife and told me he wanted to end it all. I tell you what it took three mnths him comming off that high dose to be normal again. If you can't get a doctor to listen to you I would scream and yell till I found one that didn't tell me how my son was that listened to me about how he was. YOU are raising that child not the doctor and no doctor will tell me how to deal with my son. I told my doctor this up front and he has never said you have to do this.

        I have a son with a diagnosis of Asperger's and he is also 11.  His behavior started to deteriorate during his 10th year and finally got so bad I took him to see a child psychiatrist who first prescribed Concerta.  He stopped eating and his behavior did not seem to improve so we stopped that.The docor then prescribed Risperdal which we never used because it seemed so extreme for an 11 year old.  I noticed one night that I could hear him moving around in his bed and realized he had not been sleeping well and had been going to bed really late (2 am).  I always went to bed earlier so I didn't realize he had been staying up so late. After researching on the internet I discovered an old article on research that showed autistic kids don't produce enough melatonin on their own. I got Melatonin at CVS pharmacy 3 mg which helps restore sleep cycles.  He fell asleep after 20 minutes. His behavior improved dramatically overnight...it was sort of miraculous.  After that I began to add other vitamins and supplements and have tried a totally natural course of action.  He is currently on 3 mg of Melatonin (Natrol brand purple bottle), magnesium with zinc, a probiotic, a multivitamin, and Cod liver oil.   I am always researching autism and trying to find more ways to help him and I am hoping to avoid the use of medications as long as possible. In addition we have eliminated milk products.  We are not gluten free however as I have found this harder to eliminate from his diet.We severely restrict his consumption of sugars and junk foods which contain all the additives etc. His behavior is much improved and I know he isn't ""cured"" but I feel like there is hope that he will improve gradually.  Also my son was homeschooled through the age of 11 and then began to go to a special school for kids with ASDs.  He is happy there so far.  I hope this information will help you.  We have seen a great reduction in aggresive behaviors and repetitive speech.  The thing I have realized is that traditional doctors try to solve symptoms through medications rather than trying to find the cause of the behaviors, which is a time consuming hit or iss, and trial and error process.  Good luck to you and may God bless you and your family.

        It is important for you to know that, with the right support, children experiencing the difficulties that you described can learn to be cooperative, independent, and socially appropriate. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find the right services and service providers to give children the support they need. A Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) would be the most appropriate professional to provide recommendations regarding your son’s self-injurious behavior and compliance issues. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers. There is a large and growing body of research that prescribes assessment procedures for understanding self-injurious behavior and corresponding interventions based on the assessment outcomes. A BCBA would be knowledgeable of this approach and should be able to implement appropriate assessments and make recommendations for treatment. Generally, effective interventions for compliance involve two components:  rewarding compliance and following through when you ask your child to do something. A BCBA would be able to help you to identify some effective rewards and to recommend a strategy for following through with requests that is practical given your circumstances. No matter how severe the behavior problem, it is very likely that an appropriate behavior management strategy will be effective. Therefore, I suggest that you seek this support as soon as possible. Whipping your child is not the solution to any of his behavioral difficulties. 

Given your son’s diagnosis of bipolar disorder, I assume that you are in touch with a psychiatrist. I recommend that you keep your son’s psychiatrist informed regarding his comments about killing himself and his attempts to hurt animals.

I started the procces of requesting testing for special ed services again as he was released after he completed the pre-k level. They tested him for dyslexia as per my request and found that he was. I was concerd as he turns letters and numbers around and words verbally as well as written. At home he refuses to do what he is asked without a fight and total meltdown. He tells me no all of the time, I don't want to. I get looks that could kill, and he hits himself. All of this is over small tasks like picking up toys or doing homework even if I help him. My husband thinks I should whip him for everything, I think I should chose my battels. The point is, it is causing problems all around in our home. How do we deal with his refusals to do task, fit throwing and meltdowns in a way that we can avoid those things and yet get him to do what we want and exhibit the behaviors we desire?

        This is a very difficult situation.  There has to be a reward for him even in the smallest tasks.  I know it is hard for us NTs (neurotypicals) to understand, but you must stress to your husband that discipline that works on NTs DOES NOT work on Aspie's.  You could beat your child to a pulp and it will not change him.  He has to be motivated to do the things you request.  Many NTs get an internal reward for doing the right thing, picking up after themselves, etc.  Aspie's DO NOT.  They could care less.  There has to be something in it for them to do practically anything.  So figure out what is his favorite thing and find rewards to do with that.  I have an Aspie 10 year old daugther.  Just this year she is finally making her bed, getting dressed, etc. without yelling & needing a reward.  It takes years of conditioning.  Our public school does not address this need in Aspies, so every time she melted down she was locked into a 10' x 10' cell.  She would run outside in the winter with no shoes/coat on.  There would be 4 teachers outside chasing her.  How insane is that?!  We finally moved her to a specialized class within the public school system that is ""safe"" for her to be Aspie, but also rewards her tremendously for good behavior.  After 2 weeks she completely turned around to having perfect days, with no meltdowns!  They give reward chips throughout the day for every positive behavior they show (being nice to the person next to them, talking appropriately, etc.)  They can then use those chips to purchase things.  The teacher actually buys things that the kids are interested in--she has a Webkinz cat for my daugther that is her big reward.  They have 4 levels that the kids are on, due to their behavior, with each level giving them more independence and rewards.  You have to stay at level 3 for 25 days in a row before earning level 4.  To stay on level 3 your behavior has to be 80% or better each day.  It is a very sophisticated system, but the Aspie brain really gets into it and can identify with it.  At the old school she would be in trouble all the time & not even know why!  Here, they make her write out 2 goals for the day, and she is an active part in her behavior.  This is the kind of ""school"" these kids need!  Good luck to you.  It is a very hard road.

        My son also is 9 and he has Aspergers. Your son sound just like mine, he knew everyone at school but never really plays with anyone.  He likes to people watch. He can't carry a conversation with other kids because he jumps from topic to topic, only talking about what he wants to talk about. As for school I just got him in a program called the resource room you might want to see if your school offers it. It’s a class that will help him learn to interact with other children and help with school work its more hands on for him so he’s more interested and doesn’t forget as easy. My son also had a lot of ear problems it’s very common in Asperger children. They are very smart and usually excel in one topic. My son's is math. Learning wasn’t my big problem with him it was seeing how he watch other children and seemed like he wanted to play just didn’t know how. Even at his own birthday he would be over in the corner playing by himself. Now that he has started this new class in the resource room he has made very close friends with other children with Aspergers. You need to call your school and ask for an I E P it’s just a meeting to help identify what help your child needs and where. Wither it be social or academics or maybe both. Either way you have to be that one to stand of for your son and say he needs help. Or teachers will just right him off as a bad kid and he will slip threw the cracks and will never get the help he needs now.  So talk to your doctor your school.

        I agree with the others regarding an IEP and a 504 Federal medical evaluation from the School.  The Federal Gov. has accepted Aspergers as a Disability.  Try to get him involved in outside activities, like Karate and Boys Scouts, which were recommended by our school.  Or any activity where he can show his Talent, be it sports, music, bowling, etc.  Also show an interest and attend his functions.  Encourage him to make just one friend - like a Buddy.  Aspergers find groups overwhelming.  Does he have a Pet, that is just his?  Does he have a special interest?  Make the school own up to it's responsibilities and follow through.

        I disagree about your pet comment, judeaboo said her son is very loving & not violent.  My ASPIE daughter has a very special connection with her cat that I believes adds greatly to her quality of life (petting her cat calms her when she is upset.  She also feels her cat is the only one who understands her, & claims she can communicate with her cat telepathically).  She would NEVER do anything to harm her cat, no matter how upset or frustrated she was.

1575, my son tested for Asperger’s?,"
        My son wanted a pet last year.  He loved the Warriors Books (about some cat clans I think) and begged for a cat.  He is more respectful to that kitty than all the other children.  He admonishes his sisters for being too rough with the cat.  The cat sleeps in his room at night (and he has several bedrooms to choose from).  The cat likes to be petted but not held, he is an odd breed with a quirky personality (yowls rather than meows and loves to take baths), he plays when he wants too, and he is picky about his food.  I think they are a perfect match for each other.

He did have some wild ideas like setting mouse free all over the apartment (because he would like the cat to practice his natural instincts) and we haven't got the cat fixed yet (try living with a male stud cat) because he thinks we should breed him.  We know he would be really upset if we snuck him off but I can't wait.  So if anyone has a femal Bengal they want to mate I have a free male stud with an impeccable pedigree - no fee.

Check for allergies first - many kids on the Autsm Spectrum have severe allergies.  

Most Asperger's kids want a friend - and though not a perfect substitute - they can have a very meaningful relationship with an animal.  An animal doesn't judge them.

        Your son's statement about wanting the cat to practice his natural instincts is so funny to me, because it sounds exactly like something my daughter would say!  Our cat came ""fixed"", & that really bothers my daughter because she thinks she should be allowed to have kittens.  Of course, she often says the cat didn't need to be fixed, because it was never broken!

        It sounds like your child’s language skills are within normal limits, but I would encourage you to express your concerns to your pediatrician who will be able to do a more complete assessment of your child’s development. In the meantime, be sure to encourage further language development by (a) talking frequently to your child using simple words and phrases, (b) reading and singing with your child, (c) encouraging your child to communicate using sounds and words, (d) and responding positively to your child’s appropriate attempts to communicate with sounds or full words. For example, if your child can say “ball” or even “b”, don’t accept pointing toward the ball as a request for the ball. Instead, encourage him to ask for the ball vocally by saying the word (or part of the word) yourself and then asking him to do the same. When he does respond vocally, be sure to provide enthusiastic praise and give him the ball immediately. Expanded communication skills will also help to minimize tantrums, which are very typical for children of your son’s age. Again, it is important not to accept the tantrum as a form of communication. Avoid “giving in” to tantrums. Instead, require you son to request what he wants using a more appropriate form of communication. You are essentially teaching your son how to communicate with you. If you accept tantrums and gestures as communication, that is how he will communicate with you. If you require more appropriate forms of communication, you will begin to see those more frequently. If a formal assessment does identify any developmental concerns, specialists will be able to recommend for specific strategies.

        I think pediatricians screen at 18 and 24 months for autism.  A couple web sites I found helpful were:
http://www.firstsigns.org 
http://www.info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism/pddinfo.html

Concerns many parents have about autism is if their children do not respond to their own names, cannot follow directions, have repetitive behaviors like arm flapping or rocking, walk on their toes, stack and line up their toys, play inappropriately with their toys, don't socialize with others and have limited eye contact.  Also if children don't hit developmental delays like rolling over, sitting, standing, walking, babbling, smiling and laughing, etc.  My daughter hit a lot of hers on the late side, but I was concerned at 24 months when she still didn't say any words.  At the time I didn't realize there was a difference between speaking and receptive language.  She didn't even respond to her own name, but I just thought that was part of the speech delay.  I probably should have questioned it with the pediatrician earlier, but my husband didn't say his first word until he was 2.  He is not autistic, he was just late in talking.  His first words were all numbers and he didnt' say mama or daddy until he was 3.  But then he was reading at age 3 and then caught up completely with everything, without any therapies (I don't think therapy was done earlier back in the 1970s).  He went on to college and then to grad school and has a PhD from Yale.  15 months is also a little on the early side, but personally, I'd just keep a track of it, address everything with the pediatrician, and stay on top of it, and try not to worry too much.  Plus if you stress out, your son might pick up on it and feel undo pressure to perform (i.e. speak).  Oh, and terrible twos start around 15 to 18 months, so maybe he's just starting a little early with the tantrums.  I guess with autistic children, the why of the tantrums is a clue.  My daughter had a meltdown when we rearranged the furniture in our house.  We had to move it back to original position.  She has meltdowns when anything in her routine is changed.  Autistic children generally like routines and things to be the same in their day to day activities.

Seriously, if you have concerns, address them with the pediatrician.  Especially if he's missing other milestones or is not social.  And if he's speech delayed, there is a wonderful 0 to 3 program that is government subsidized, that deals with lots of delay issues.  I think for just speech delays he probably wouldn't qualify until 24 months or so unless there are other things going on.  Also boys are generally later than girls to start talking.  Good luck.  Raising children is difficult, no matter what the issues.

1584,Asperger's son becoming violent,"
        It sounds like the educational, behavioral, and psychiatric services being provided to your son are not addressing his needs to your satisfaction.  One of the first recommendations that I have is that you look into schools that specialize in working with children that have diagnoses and behavioral challenges similar to your son’s.  Unfortunately, I have known a number of families that have had to move or send their children into residential programs because there was simply no appropriate school close enough to their homes.  These will be tough decisions for you to make but it is impossible to stress enough the importance of having your child being taught in a setting in which his individual needs are addressed.  Regarding his behavioral programming, it is simply not the case that behavioral interventions need to occur in conjunction with psychotropic medication.  I’m not sure of your child’s diagnoses, but there is no reason that a qualified behavior analyst can’t work with you on developing strategies to deal with your son’s aggression regardless of any anxiety that he is exhibiting.  If you’re not satisfied with the services provided by your behavioral clinicians, seek new clinicians.  A good choice would be a certified behavior analyst who has successfully worked with aggressive children that have characteristics similar to your son’s. The behavior analysis certification board has a website on which you should be able to find clinicians in your area.

        I feel for you--we are in the same boat.  I have a 10 year old daugther with AS.  She is starting to get more violent at school--spitting, biting, kicking, knocking over desks, but she does not do this at home.  She does talk about wanting to kill people, including herself, but we are hoping this is just her anger & frustration talking.  We have just started neurofeedback.  I can't say if it is working yet, but, like you, are trying everything we can to see if it will help.  Good luck to you on your journey--and what a journey it is!

1586,Asperger's son becoming violent,"
        Call a child advocate or special ed lawyer - we got our child into a school specifically for children with Asperger's and other neurobiological orders (Gersh Academy).  He went from miserable to very happy in 5 months.  He refused to do ay schoolwork for two years - now he is happily complying.  The school has changed his and our lives.  

It was not on the state list - the district was told to settle before we take them in front of a judge on April 1 (the BOE is enjoying their one adjournment).  Do you write a letter every time an incident occurs - a contemperous record is very important?  Our lawyer was thrilled with my husband (also a lawyer) who had assembled a dream correspondence file.  Do you ask specifically how tthe school is going to deal with his problems?  No ambiguity is allowed.  The lawyer/advocate will tell you if you have a case. 
 
My husband just kept putting it all on the school - and then presented several neuropsychs with recommendations that they could not accomodate.  My husband had the principal so worried that she hired a shadow who was a certified teacher out of her discretionary budget. Most schools are ill trained to deal with these kids.  

What will an advocate do for you?  They will help you make a plan.  Special ed law is very complicated.  My husband just directed another lawyer at his firm (his child has severe learning diabilities) to our advocate.  Yesterday, he came into my husband's office and thanked him as he was clueless as what to do.  If Ivy league white shoe lawyers are lost in the system - trust me, the average American doesn't have a chance.  Most advocates in the NYC area cost about $100/hr but many work on a sliding scale.  The advantage to a lawyer is that you can ususally get most of the fees recovered if you win in court.  We ended up paying for both - but we only have to pay the lawyer if it goes to impartial.  Also, a good advocate knows which judge is family friendly and when better to settle.  Generally speaking, if you get a letter for private school in NYC, the BOE will start negotiations at 65% of tuition - then you decide where you eant to settle after that or go for the impartial.  At the impartial, it is all or nothing - but a judge can penalize slightly if he liked the BOE's settlement.  Our neighbor didn't see a lawyer befor ehepulled his kid and placed him.  Big mistake - he lost.  The lawyer can only do so much to clean up a case - tht is why it is important to go to the advocate/lawyer to see where you stand.

All the pscho-eds and the IEP's may not get you what you need - if you don't know the rules of the game.  Making our son a productive member of society has become our mission.  Finding an appropriate school for him was tantamount.  He would not have done well in an environment specifically catered for learning disabled (nor were the schools interested in him) or low performing students.  His school as severely autistic children but they rarely meet with each other (sometimes at lunch) and they have little interaction with the Asperger's children.

Learn to light a fire under your school administration. My husband was relentless. 
People should not take no for an answer.  In the beginning I was horrified about my son's behavior - embarrassed - but then I realized that most of this did not go on at home.  It was the school system that was inappropriate for him.  Never again did I listen to a long litany of what he did with no solutions.

Place it all on their feet!  You have to worry about your relationship with him at home.    Does he have an IEP?  What were the results of his FBA?  Why didn't they offer one?  Do you think he needs further testing?  A psycho-ed was probably not sufficient.  Ask for a NESPY.  It isn't in the budget.  Well, I guess I will have to have an impartial hearing to get one.   Send letter.  All of a sudden you will be granted the NESPY.  Diid you ask for a SEIT class, A CTT class - good ground work before you play let's try to get the state to pay for a private school game.  Trust me, if you think you hate the BOE now - you will be wanting their heads on a platter when that begins.  Asperger's kids don't do well in schools for ED/abusive kids - it is like sending a lamb to the slaughter.  That is why you want your FBA and NESPY in hand - it will save a lot of time with your advocate - a good one will ask for it anyway.

Your kid has been diagnosed with Asperger's.  Good for you.  He is protected under the law.  Schools full of ED kids who are violet are not actually an appropriate environment for an Asperger's child.  It is like leading a lamb to the slaughterhouse.  You are sending a child (who is incapable of reading social clues) into an environemnt where being able to do so will keep him from being thrown up against a wall or smashed by a flying chair.  As the school's FBA will show his emotions are triggered by frustration and he is not an inherently violent child.  

If you think this is the route you will be taking - go school shopping and apply to the ones you like- even if he doesn't go.  The good ones on the state approved lists fill up fast.  Be wary of schools with residential programs - they tend to have the most severely disturbed and violent children. Ask for a class profile - they have to provide one.  Usually no one asks - so again, another technicality for the judge to rule in your favor.  The state wanted to send my son to the most bucolic one in the state (until I pulled up their scores - since they were a part of a public school district) - not a single child out of the 102 students had made state standards on the exams.  You really have to do your homework - they can look beautiful but they don't tell you those things on the phone.

Another one, the Child School, which is in NYC - has a beautiful campus.  They take the kids to Europe every summer.  Our advocate rolled her eyes, his doctors rolled their eyes, and then I went to the message boards.  A horror story in the making.  I met a teenager on the bus (it ws kind of funny becuase it was empty but she plopped down next to me).  Within a minute you could tell she had Asperger's.  She was going to her job as a tour guide at the Museum.  She told me what the director did to kids and how she was glad when she went to Summit.  Both paid for by the state - pretty campus - with tons of openings - the other a two hour bus ride but no room in the inn.  Shopper beware.

        Don't be afraid of a therapeutic school - there are wonderful ones out there.  I wish he had been there sooner.    Imagine an environment that truly understands your child, where there is no bullying, and you have a real IEP.  They actually read and understand your child's test scores and work on their strengths - not their weaknesses.  Every day is a new day there.  So even if you mess up the teacher still wants you there the next day.  My sons class has 4 children, a special ed teacher, and an aide - all specifically trained to work with Asperger's kids.  Academics are kept to a high standard in his class - it is much harder than public school was.  He used to get 100's on every test in public school - he is lucky to pull an 80 now.  He is in fourth grade - his test questions ate - Explain how the Battle of LI affected the rest of the Amerian Revolution or Describe how mineral deposits form in oceans?  In math he was started on double digit division with decimals.  A teacher who loves his high reading level and his love of vocabulary.  She sends home alot of vocabulary homework.    I don't know what everyone's kids are interested in - but mine loves words and word origins, puns, he lives with a walking dictionary.  He is also a grammatical whiz - we think he will be a copy editor when he grows up.  As I said, there is a program for every kid - you just need to find your child's place.  They school is Zen like.  And for the first time in his life, he has friends.  

Oh, by the way, Prozac was a disaster for him.  He is also 9.  He gained 20-30lbs and became very oppositional.  ADHD meds didn't work.  Buspar was a bust - though he was huggy/kissy on it.  Tenex has worked well - it can really curb emotions and impulsivity.  It also has few side effects. He also takes 6mg of melantonin at night.  He was having trouble sleeping and his psychiatrist said a study was just released supporting it in children that don't sleep well.  I only threw that in because he was so anxious that he did not sleep.  

Again.

Good Luck

1588,Asperger's son becoming violent,"
        Hi Sue,
        My son is 11 years old and autistic / asperger's.  In elementary school (Suffolk County, NY) we had a difficult time getting the school on board with autism and my sons needs.  Through much letter writing, documentation, and a lawyer we were finally able to get my son a one on one aide and everyone on board.  I have always thought that the grades he was receiving were “inflated” and not giving a true measure of his capabilities.  For instance, he was given an A in language arts when his neuropsychological show severe problems in this area. I do his homework with him every day (believe me, he is no A student). When I mentioned this at a CSE meeting they countered by saying he excelled in grammar rules etc..  Anyway, I feel elementary school has been a complain and patch relationship all along. With much trepidation he has entered the middle school  and again he “seems” to be excelling, he even made the honor role.  The problem is that he can’t relate to the other students. At home acts like a child. He talks nonsense talk and has many unusual behaviors. He is very oppositional at home (and we are not pushovers).  He has a great Special Ed teacher (who really cares) and a one on one aide.  As well as he seems to be doing academically, I don’t believe they are addressing his other problems and severe social deficits.  The Special Ed teacher is great but I’m sure she is limited in the amount of time she can spend with him.  The aide is a big mystery and we have limited contact with her.  They do some socialization work but it seems it’s “just for the record”.   He needs a more intense program .
         I know my son could graduate from this district but he will not have the tools to lead the  independent  life that I know  he would be capable of with a more intense and customized curriculum.  We always wanted to keep my son in as “normal” an atmosphere as possible.  Our thinking was that by being around typical children, he would act typical. I don’t know if our reasoning was correct. It was alright for a child to act like a child but soon he will be 12.  He doesn’t seem to be opening up like we had hoped.  I know you have a son who attends Gersh Academy, were you ever at such a cross road?  What made you look into Gersh?  There has to be a way to connect him to the world. Can Gersh do this? Can you recommend a contact? Is your PTA open to the public? How would I know if the school is right for him? I was not aware that the district would pay for a school not approved by the state.  I know I will have a hard time proving his need because of the high grades but I’m really beginning to think we are being snowed and I think I can prove it (I save every thing related to his school work).  Sorry for the barrage of questions but I think you know where I’m at. 

                                                                                                       Thanks

1589,Twelve year old son - Asperger's?,"
        I am sorry you are having all these problems and understand your concern.  Please do follow-up with a thorough diagnosis with a pediatric neurologist and/or a team of specialists who are very familiar with diagnosing and prescribing educational and behavioral treatments for students with Aspergers.  Regarding the shower issue I do not think this is necessarily related to that diagnosis as much as it is a symptom of some behavioral issues probably related to your son's social problems.  It could also be, I suppose, related to some increasing hormonal/masturbation/sexual issues that are manifesting a off-beat way.  I would definitely consult ask the people who participate in the diagnosis of these behaviors to see if they are familiar with them and I would also think seriously of contacting a behavioral specialist to work on a non confrontational program to reinforce him taking showers appropriately and, if it is at all related to sexual behavior, to have appropriate private time.  Hope this helps.

        Following up with neuropsycholoigst is certainly a good idea.  I recommend that you Try to find a neurophyschologist who specializes in (i.e., has seen a lot of children with) Asperger’s Disorder.  Also, coincidentally I know a pediatric neurologist in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, Dr. Steve Janousek, and I asked for his opinion.  Steve told me he would be glad to see any child with the question of whether their behavioral tendency has something other than a constitutional basis. He said that he would first see whether cerebral imaging, EEG, metabolic and/or genetic testing would be potentially revealing. He also mentioned that he may have something to offer the family with regard to navigating life with a “special needs” child. (His number for an appointment is: 612-879-1507 and he said to ask for nurse Beth).

        It is hard to find doctors who truly understand Asperger's.  My daughter's pediatrician mentioned it & we started researching it & it was like, ""Wow--so that is it!""  We had been homeschooling, so we went to the school for testing with the attitude that we knew this was it.  They agreed.  As far as finding doctors to actually help, that has been not happening for us.  Our daugther is 10 & we have been to many drs., support groups, seminars, & read every book under the sun.  All the books point out the behaviors my daugther exhibits, but I've yet to find one that actually helps us deal with it.

I am glad that you have asked for a referral to have your 2 ½ year old evaluated. It is so important to intervene as soon as any type of developmental difficulty is detected. I also recommend that you contact a Board Certified Behavior Analyst who can provide some recommendations regarding the behavioral difficulties that you are observing. There is abundant evidence that difficult behavior can be improved dramatically with straight forward behavioral interventions. However, this type of intervention should be based on a thorough assessment by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers. I also recommend that you talk with your pediatrician and a Board Certified Behavior Analyst regarding your children’s difficulty sleeping. Typical interventions for sleep problems (e.g., delayed onset, frequent or long night wakings) involve a consistent bedtime routine implemented at a developmentally appropriate hour, attempts to minimize day sleep, and elimination of any potentially rewarding interactions (e.g., conversation, back pats) or activities (television) during scheduled sleep times.

        Hi, my daughter just turned 4, and we are preparing for an eval for possible autism disorder.  She did same with potty. Trained fairly easy at two, for few months or so, than started wetting & soiling herself.  Since then we have been back and forth between panties & pull ups and has had constant trouble.  She also has other signs of autism and sees a play therapist once a week and was referred to neuropsych for testing.  My daughter also didn't seem to understand and it was frustrating because I knew she could do it.  I also didn't understand.  The older she got, the more things started to show that didn't seem normal.  But, with therapy these last few months, and enrollment in preschool, she has progressed and is now in panties full time and rarely has an accident!!!  I would recommend at least talking to your ped dr. about whatever else your daughter is doing, possibly get a referal to a specialist!  Good luck.

        It is impossible to diagnose autism over the internet and certainly not based on this much information.  I would certainly schedule an appointment with my pediatrician to discuss her toileting issues and see if there any other symptoms that suggest a more thorough evaluation by a pediatric neurologist or a developmental pediatrician.  It may be that she is having some behavioral issues around toileting and if that is the extent of the problem the less attention you pay to it the better.  You might want to go back to a pull up for a while to de-emphasize the issue and put in some basic positive reinforcement toileting program when you want to try to work on toilet training again.  Resources can be found at www.BACB.com to find Certififed Behavior Analysts in your area who could provide consultation on the toileting problem or, if other symptoms appear and result in a diagnosis, early intervention techniques.

        This sounds like an extremely challenging situation. As a disclaimer I need to note that no responsible therapist can diagnose over the internet or give you a prescription for the best course of action.  However, I would consider this child potentially dangerous and not permit unsupervised visits with the 9-year old and very close monitoring at all times.  I think you should immediately take steps to have this boy evaluated by a psychiatrist who will likely indicate, based on the reports in this question,  indicate that he poses a risk to his family members. I would also be in contact with his school district immediately about seeking a residential placement at a school with clinicians that have experience working with children with similar issues.  I wouldn’t take any risks with this case.

        Prozac was a big no-no for my son.   Sometimes if they have a bad reaction to it - it can signal that bipolare may be at play.  His doctors are very cautious and will not diagnose bipolar until a child is much older.  
 

There seems to be aperception on this board that children with Asperger's are very violent.  I have not found that case with my son.  He has been known t push, shove or even hit one of his siblings when they didn't stop bothering him (he usually verbally asks them too before he makes a physical move).  But I have seen his non-Aspie sisters do the same to each other (one likes to bite).  His sister can actually take hm down without to much a problem so maybe tht is why they don't fight too often.  My kids are 7, 8 and 9 and we have fierce rivalry going on.  My sister's boys are all on travel teams - and those kids (the athlestes - nothers in particular) have been known to get pretty physcial with other team's members off the field.  Some of this is hormonal.

But as far as planned posionings, etc. - there is something deeper going on than just Asperger's.  The kid almost sounds a bit like a psychopath.  My son's actions tend to be more the impulsive type and he ususally seems toregret them afterwards - or has a very logical explanation (not that I condone siblings smacking each other).

There was a very violent child in my son's public school that was sent to live in a resifdential hospital for three months because he was hitting teachers, students, and throwing chairs across the room.  The poor mother was besides himself.  He lives in a residential school.  Regardless, this child obviously can be classified as Emotionally Disturbed and placed in a residential school if the family is in that much danger.

Our friends adopted an abused child (I am not saying this child was abused so don't take it the wrong way) whowas also violent.  He lives in a residential school and comes home most weekends.  Other than that, he would heave been left in a group home - at least he now has a family that cares for him.

        I can't even imagine how you cope with all these terrible things going on.  I have a daughter with Asperger's and has always been horribly noncompliant, she would never hurt me or an animal.  She does get horribly angry, breaks things, slams doors, screams and yells and runs out of the house, but I made it clear a long time ago, things can be replaced.  When these kids get frustrated, they lack the ability to rationalize and talk it out when they are in hyper mode.  

But what you describe is definitely more pathological.   I hate to be this blunt, but you are describing the behavior of a serial killer.  This is not something to be toyed with.  You have to understand just because he has Asperger's doesn't mean he is not affected with other, more dangerous problems.  You can never leave him alone with anyone, especially children, babies and animals.  You said he has already hurt and killed animals.  He is very sick, and needs to be seen by someone specializing in these areas.
He definitely needs medication and hospitalization.  I realize you are overwhelmed and don't know what to do, but you have the internet, and you can locate anything you need.

        That is very scarey what you are saying. Personally, I think your child is bipolar. Alot of these disorders are never just 1. It's more common then you think for a child on the spectrum also has bipolar. Puberty is the time when then things pop up. 

My son was dx'd with bipolar at 5 years old. (after getting ASD ruled out at 3.5y) We treated the symptoms he had with lots of meds--most of which did nothing (except that wonderful Risperdal!! Can't live without it!)

At 6y--he finally got the dx I knew he had---HFA. Along with bipolar. I did a med wash. Within 3 mo, he had to be put back on Risperdal---the rages and violence was out of control. At 7y, He got the bipolar dx dropped. He is also on Strattera for impulsiveness. We finally enjoy our child for the first time in our lifes!!! Most bipolar can't be on strattera or any ADHD type meds. 

My son was dx'd bipolar based on the fact he goes manic with ANY SSRI's(antidepressants), and the violence, rages, etc.

We are seen at Childrens Mercy Hospital in the Kansas City area. You have to be persistant and call every time there is a problem. Don't think you are being a pest. They won't know unless you tell them and you waste time in between appointments by not calling. The older of the boys does loose his temper but with age he takes redirection pretty well. Also, the boys joined a youth program in our church. They have been helpful once they knew what Aspergers is and how to help them integrate. Don't be afraid to ask for help and prayers for them.

        Hi,
 I have been dealing with this same issue since my son was diagnosed at 2 yrs old with Autism. This article hit it on the nose. I took my son to several Gastro Dr.s and they said same thing, but to much controvery over the subject. So I went out on my own and found a Lab in CA who would perform the tests and they confirmed he had yeast overgrowth. I cut out 95% of the sugars and yeast products including all bread, milk, and most dairy. He gets Rice milk instead of Soy or Regular. He seems to tolerate this better than anything on the market. I also give him good yeast in yogurt from a herb store. This helps alot. Plus they do make Natural peanut butter and yeast free crackers. He, since this change has been more alert, behavior issues are nill to none and has stopped almost all stimulation activities. He has stopped vomiting and his stools are normal. His used to be very gritty like dirt and smell awful. Now, he does sometimes break out so we use Gentian Violet which is a natural herb you can get from pharmacy that is a anti fungal. Swab in mouth ( where it starts) and swab bottom areas. Its purple and stains so be careful. Use it only 3-4 days. Just remember all antibiotics will make it even worse so avoid use unless absolutely neccesary. Oh and as a side note I feed my son lots of watermelon now since I heard from a nutritionist its the most natural detoxifier on the market!!! about 1/2 cup a day. Hope this helps.

        My Son is 3 and 1/2 year old. He is speech delay. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism during my pregnancy where my son's thyroid seems to be fine. He also does facial tics some times and goes to Preschool 3 hours a day. He has no words. He some times says words randomly and totally unpredictable.

Some thing new I came across was, when ever he takes Pediasure in the morning before his school he seems to react very well. I tested this many times. The result is the same. For few weeks I give him Pediasure every day and those or the days I get good remarks. I gave a month break and started Pediasure again. the results are same. This strongly makes me feel that its some vitamin/mineral/protein that he is lacking which this pediasure is supplementing. Can some one help me here? what should/can I do now to find it?

        The behavioral patterns that you describe for your son are congruent with a developmental delay diagnosis.  Individuals with developmental delays may engage in self-injuious head banging and stereotypy such as body rocking or spinning.  Over the last 30 years, significant progress has been made both in terms of treating problem behavior in individuals with developmental delays and in terms of promoting skill acquisition.  A critical factor to the success of your son in these areas is to make sure that he is recieving appropriate educational services.  I also recommend seeking out professionals who have experience in treating the behavior problems that you describe and beginning systematic behavioral intervention.

        If you look at the Diagnostic Statistical Manual and the 3 factors of autism are:  delay in speech, delays in social interaction and odd or restricted interests.  I would ask for an evaluation for special education services.  I am from the US and have no idea how things work in N. Ireland but that is how things work here.  There are many places in England that conduct research and intervention in the field of autism.  Also, research says that if you have someone in your family in the autistic specturm, you can be more likely to have a child with autism.  I would go to your school district or agency which provides educational services and make a formal request, in writing, for a comprehensive evaluation for special education services.

My name is yanti, I have 6,5 years daughter, Aini, that diagnostic with GDD. First time I knew somethingwrong with my daughter when she's 5 month. From that day she see the manykind of therapic, doctor etc. I have a suggestion for you, that's works on me. Pls take more time with your son. He's need you more than the other kids. If for the other kid you have 5 hours a day, for your son you most spend at leat 10 hours. Maybe.. its sound silly. But I proff it. My little Aini has more ""life"" annd ""growing"" when I am beside her intesively. I compare it when her situation, when I pay an expensive baby sister, and spend more time with the expert. Pls try this..., more... your love, more...your attention, more.....your kiss, more...your tears, more...your hope, more....your pray... + the expert hand (like the therapic, doctors etc) he can reach more than what he get now.  

Just for your information,  my liitle aini,  walk at 2,5 years,  talk at 4 years. Now in her 6,5 years old she can swimm, (her capability is on the 5 - 6 years) She like to help me clean the house.

And Pls. pls never compare your son with the other cildren. Its unfair. He has a special talent that noone have. Pls Love and except him like the way he is. 

I and my family pray for your son goodness. I know someday You can proud on him more than you can image. And I know someday he will put your name high with what he can reach off.

        The great news is that you have arrived at a diagnosis early and have secured intervention at 2 years. The prognosis for children with autism is much better when appropriate intervention begins early. It is important for you to realize that there is no “quick fix” for autims. Applied Behavior Analysis is the only approach to the treatment of autism that has extensive empirical support, but this approach requires much hard work by children, parents, and ABA therapists. Do not be frustrated if you don’t see immediate improvement. It is also important for you to know that there is a national certification for behavior analysts to help provide consumers information regarding the training that clinicians have received. If one is available, I recommend that you seek the assistance of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers. 

Many parents feel that they should try every available intervention to be sure that they have provided their child with every opportunity for improvement. But, it is important for you to become educated on those interventions for which there is research support, those that are likely to be ineffective or harmful, and those that are merely poorly understood. You may find it helpful to read the research reviews created by the research department here at The New England Center for Children (http://www.necc.org/research/newsletter.asp). These would be a starting place for collecting information about various approaches to autism treatment. Becoming an informed consumer may prevent you from wasting time (yours and your child’s) and resources on interventions with no research support.

        Good for you getting him into SP, OT, and ABA so quickly!  Yes, many autistic children do improve with these types of therapy and some recover quicker than others.  Yes, there are some autistic children who may need assistance their entire lives.  I have seen some autistic children in the type of programs your child is in who progress very quickly from the start, some who don't progress at all and then begin to progress later on, and some who do not show signs of progress for many years and may need therapy for the rest of their life.  

As a mother of an autistic child, you are doing great!  You may be able to find autism support groups in your area; getting together with other mothers of autistic children can provide great friendship and support. 
As an ABA therapist, I would suggest that you learn as much about ABA as you can and watch your son's therapists at work with him.  See how they deal with his self-stimulatory (stymmy) behaviors so that you are able to shape them out of his every day life when he is not seeing therapists.  Sit in on some Speech sessions and use their techniques when you're alone with him.  He'll be able to get speech therapy with the SP Therapist and again at home or in the car with mom!
I have a client whose does 36-40 hours of ABA each week but when she is not with a therapist, her family allows her to stymm (rocking, hand flapping, etc.) almost non-stop without ever interferring.  It's hurting her progress.
I'm sure you are already very involved in your child's therapy and I just want to encourage you to remain involved! 

Be Blessed!

        ABA, Speech and OT are great roads to take in terms of treating your child.  I agree with generi that you should sit in on a speech session if possible.  Doing the same for the ABA and OT sessions might be valuable too.  The behavior interventions used in ABA can be applied to your child's life outside of the ABA session.  Please keep a good eye on your child's diet.  New research has come out on boys with autism having thin bones and the GF-CF diet having determental effects on boys with autism.

        The term cure is controversial even when a person previously diagnosed with autism loses that diagnosis later in life.  Many prefer the term recovery. The only empirically-validated, effective intervention is teaching the child diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder the skills they need to function independently using the tools of applied behavior analysis. Early intensive behavioral intervention has been shown to produce marked changes in the skill deficits and problem behavior associated with autism.  Some children have been noted to lose their diagnosis following a period of individualized instruction. 

The second question is a bit hard to understand but I'll assume you are referring to secretin injection.  Secretin is a hormone that exists naturally in the body and is involved in gastrointestinal functioning. It was reported in a medical journal that a single intravenous injection of secretin had resulted in substantial improvements in language and behavioral difficulties for three children diagnosed with autism. However, this was not a controlled study and the means of determining whether the injection had an effect was questionable. Strong scientific evidence has been growing that secretin has no clinically meaningful impact. 

Several recent studies have confirmed secretin’s failure to improve skill performance or behavior problems and have addressed some of the criticisms of earlier investigations. One criticism of several controlled studies has been that the children injected with secretin have not had gastrointestinal problems. A study, conducted by scientists from Harvard University’s Medical School and the University of California, looked at children diagnosed with autism who were also reported to have gastrointestinal difficulties (Lightdale et al., 2001). They found that secretin produced no increases in language or other social skills and no decreases in problem behavior. 

Another criticism has been that some children require multiple injections of secretin to show beneficial effects. A study by Roberts and colleagues (2001) investigated the effects of repeated injections of secretin relative to injections of a placebo with 64 children diagnosed with autism. They found no evidence that secretin was an effective treatment. They noted that both groups improved in receptive and expressive communication but that these gains “were likely attributable to familiarity with the testing situation, maturation, and/or ongoing behavioral interventions.” The study also found that the secretin injection was associated with: a rash for one child; a fever, rapid heartbeat, and vomiting for another child; an increase in irritability in 3 children; and, a flushing of the skin for 21% of the children who were injected with secretin.

        There are other controversial treatments in autism without substantial scientific evidence:  GF/CF diets, chelation, etc.  The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Center for Disease Control have both not supported these controversial treatments.   As an educator, I believe it is important to pursue treatments validated by the medical and educational communities.  Applied Behavior Analysis is supported by long-term studies.  The TEACCH model also has evidence of effectiveness.

        You are asking two important questions about your son's problem behavior.  One, can medication help.  Two, what else can be done to help him.  You are certainly not alone in having to deal with this.  These are questions that I get commonly and I have included below some comments that that were given to another parent that I hope might help you.

There are medications that have been shown to have a beneficial impact on problem behavior in some individuals.  If you plan on going this route, make sure you find a prescriber that has experience working with children like your son and make sure that you are comfortable with the plan for treatment and monitoring the effects of the medication.

Regarding the problem behavior, although medication can, in some cases, be effective in suppressing problem behavior, the intervention that has been shown to be most reliably effective is applied behavior analysis.  Over 20 years of rigorous experimental evidence has shown that children can learn appropriate alternatives to severe problem behavior given the right teaching arrangement.  Behavior analytic interventions typically involve identifying the situations that are most problematic for a child and the things that are most rewarding and systematically teaching a child more appropriate ways of handling problematic situations and of obtaining reinforcing things and events.  These interventions are individualized to the needs of the particular child and, with the right services, the prognosis for treatment of severe problem behavior can be quite good.  I recommend that you also look into identifying a board certified behavior analyst who has experience treating behavior problems exhibited by children like yours.  You could start at the certificant registry on the BCBA website: http://www.bacb.com/

        My doctor just diagnosed a case of Aspergers for 1 32 year old hedge fund manager - anything is possible.  You need to get her tested - but don't automatically assume autism -certain behaviors are on many lists.  

Intelligence has nothing to do with thi s- my fourth grader was happily devouring David Copperfield as he went on to his Special Ed bus this morning.  He could also read at three - bu the was not functioing well in the day to day school set up.

Either way, she is having difficulties and they need to be addressed.  If she is smart the standard school psych-ed is not going to be enough.  You may want to ask for some other testing - like a NESPY - which may have to be done off site (if the situation is bad most schools will agree to pay for it - but you may have a struggle).  Then get her an IEP - the schools really can't do much without an IEP.  

Good luck, I was a nightmare of a child - maybe that is where my son gets it from.  Lying in itself is not assoiciated with autism per se.  Many people with Asperger's are incredibly honest.  So you have to ask yourself - is it lying - or a different perception.  Is your child acting out for other reasons?  My middle kid (the most perfectly behaved child at school is the one who hits the triggers at home - she lies, breaks her siblings things on purpose, etc. - she is adored at school).  My son is literal - we are the ones usually accused of lying because he keeps us to the very letter of whatever agreement we keep.  His ""lying"" is usually a promise he makes at the time - like if you let me read for 20 minutes I will do myhomework - then he gets so involved with what he is doing that he tries to negate the promise.  

For instance, it is state test prep time.  If his teacher sends home a pack - no problem.  He will do math for 2 hours straight because it is homework.  If I try to get him to do it - here comes the fireworks.  

You failed to mention any of the other crteria - like rigid thinking, does she have any obsessions, does she look people in the face when she is talking to you, does she do any repetative (almost mindless behaviors) in order to calm down.  Does she speak in an odd, robotic cadence (my son doesn't - but then he is very borderline).  He, on the other hand, uses the most precise vocabulary in the world.  

The psycho-ed is important.  According to my son's multitude of doctors, the higher the IQ - the more they are able to compensate.  Sam's inferential skills are through the roof - but he also reads in excess of 2,000 books a year - he knows the patterns.  People with Aspergers are highly logical and analytical.  Many are pronse to sensory issues - does the school overwhelm her.  Mys son is very sensitive to noise and it distracted him to the point that he was hiding out in bathrooms all day.    Is she in middle school - that is a lot of transitioning.  She may need a quiet space to reorganize every day.

There is a great book by Dr. Greene called the ""Explosive Child"".  He is the consulting psychiatrist at my son's school.  I believe he is at Harvard and my psychologist tells me tht they use his methods at the pediatric psychiatric war at Boston Hospital with great success (though he is more of a Barkley disciple in the ABA world - so you may want to check out Barkley's work). It goves ypu great insight to these type of personalities - Asperger's or not.

We have been at this for about three years now - it has gotten so much better.  It is time for your family to go oin - as one doctor told us - this is as much about training the parents as it is the child.  I also have an ""explosive personality"" and I had to learn to deal with one.  Our doctors couldn't have found a more mismatched parent-child relationship.

Cheer up - the other piece of great advice I had from this doctor - when the school was wearing us down - was leave it at school.  We tend to view our children as a reflection of ourselves - so when the school calls we feel as if we are being judged as bad parents.  Your relationship with your child is 20X more important than your relationship with his/her school.  Once we got over that - we really became great advocates for him.  Your child is just a temporary thing that the school has to deal with - just one of many students (some with bigger problems) - so do not get overwhelmed by their comments.  Your relationship with your child is forever.   

Good Luck,

Susan NYC

        You did the right thing by contacting your physician to determine if there is a medical reason for these accidents. If there is no identifiable medical reason, you might consider some other ways of addressing the problem. First, consider whether any aspects of your child’s schedule or environment have changed in a way that might lead to accidents. Is she drinking more fluids? Is she having less frequent opportunities to use the bathroom? If she independently requests to use the bathroom, is there any reason that she may be doing so less frequently (e.g., a new teacher)? This information might point to some simple changes such as more frequent reminders to use the bathroom.

In some cases, the causes of urinary accidents are a bit more complicated. For example, I have worked with typically developing children and children with developmental disabilities who appear to have urinary accidents to (a) change outfits, (b) get attention from an adult caregiver, (b) get out of some unpleasant situation. In these cases, it is important to be sure that the child has an appropriate way to request these things (if appropriate). It can also be useful to begin rewarding urinations in the toilet.

1659,asperger's or something else,"
        As a parent, please bring it up gently and very professional with the parents.  I have had teachers come up to me and ask if he was on meds - not your role. I have had teachers ask me or his siblings (they weren't even his teachers) whether he has an ASD (even the experts don't know).  Why they would ask a 7 year old child is beyond me - just nosy I guess.   One teacher used to make cruel remarks (not his) and called him the pencil geek to his face (he sort of stimmed with a pencil).  You can't even complain about it because the teachers will lie when they screw up and the only reason one wasn't fired (she was an Ivy League grad) was because she fessed up to it - as the principal was rolling her eyes.  We actually liked this teacher (it was her first year) and my husband was desperately just trying to get her to stop her immature behavior.  She actually liked Sam because he read really intense books - it was rare to find a third grader who wanted to discuss Brave New World - so all in all it was an uncomfortable situation to bring her to task.

ll these evaluations take time even if the parents are amicable (sometimes they are not).  In the meantime, I suggest you ask them if you can start a communication notebook.    My son, who goes to a special ed school now, has one.  I absolutely love it.  There is no ambiguity about what happened in the school day.  If he was oppositional or did not cmplete an assignment I know about it.  If he fell asleep in class - I know about it.  Geberally it is only about a paragraph a day unless he had a bad day or sometimes it just says he had a wonderful day.  That makes me smile.  If he had a confrotation - I know about it.  But most important, it is never judgemental.  And please remember to treat each day as a new one with this child.  

Also, if it is as bad as you say, you may suggest ""off the record""  so you don't get into trouble, that they contact a Child Advocacy group.  They are about 15X more helpful than the school social worker in getting the necessary help for a child.  They serve both low and high income families.  They have been as imporatant as all his psychiatrists and psychologists combined (and in fact, they were the ones who sent us to one).  

But it still may not go well.  It is amazing how many parents with behavior problem children have come up to us (one with a classic case of undiagnosed Asperger's) and ask me what to do.  Many are afraid to get their children labeled because of the stigma it brings (we have one psychiatrist willing to push the diagnosis of Asperger's even though my son does not make full criteria for AS (even my husband defers because he would rather have the ADHD label).  So don't be surprised if the parents seem to be blowing you off.  It is a process.  It took us three years until we had any real improvement.  ANd honestly, the NYC Board of Ed was not exactly helpful because he was a high academic achiever and why would a straight A student need services.  Good Luck - you seem like a great teacher - just remember - don't seem frustrated, personally hurt by the child, and don't try to diagnosis yourself - because I can tell you - sometimes it is harder than you think.  But most of be compassionate to the child and parents - sometimes these kids can be the hardest to understand and love because of their social development, but in reality, they need it the most.  Parents can truly sense when a teacher really wants to help and one who is counting the days for this kid to move on.

1660,asperger's or something else,"
        This may be a bit random, but could the child need to use the bathroom and not want to admit that in front of everyone?

I remember doing something very similar (only I didn't realize what I was doing).  I sat on my hands and wiggled when I had to go pee and didn't want to get up to go to the bathroom. It would temporarily make the uncomfortable feeling go away so I could stay in the classroom and not have to ask to be excused. Eventually it would get pretty bad, because the bladder can only hold so much.  I would inevitably have to get the bathroom pass. By then I've already been rocking quite a bit in my seat and probably creating quite a visual disturbance I was unaware that I was creating.  I never really enjoyed having to get the bathroom pass. If I remember I had to raise my hand and ask the teacher to get the pass. Some teachers were very insistent upon asking the proper question, ""May I go the restroom?"" and not accept such questions like, ""Can I go to the bathroom?"" or ""Can I use the toilet?"" Then I'd have to walk up to the front of the class or wherever the pass was located, take it and be interrupted from the class.

Dry skin and itching is another possibility. If the child is itching there, they may be trying to relieve the irritation. I tend to itch everywhere on my body. At times my whole skin would itch, arms, torso, legs, face, scalp, feet, butt and you guessed it...  I’m still not sure what causes the intense itching and discomfort. It is probably a food allergy or skin problem. (I suspect KP because of the texture of my skin) I sometimes find relief from the itching with lotion and sometimes not.

        Without impairments in communication or social interaction, it is unlikely that your son meets the criteria for an autism-spectrum diagnosis.  That being said, a diagnosis of autism or of any other sort is just a diagnosis.  It is a label that is used to identify individuals that tend to share certain deficits but it, in and of itself, will not change how your son behaves.  Problems with tantrums and noncompliance are not necessarily atypical.  I would recommend that you have your son seen by specialists who have experience diagnosing autism spectrum disorders to either rule it out or to find out if they believe that a diagnosis is appropriate.  However, regardless of whether or not he is given a diagnosis, the behavior problems sound to be of sufficient concern to warrant intervention.  There are behavior analysts and psychologists who have extensive experience dealing with the types of problems that you are describing.  I recommend treating the behavior problem as the problem and seeking professional help in managing it.

        Does he have friends? Does he like to play with other children? If so, maybe he is not AS.  Have you considered ADD or ADHD? Ask the doctor that will evaluate him for AS to check him for ADD/ADHD. He sounds to me like ADHD. Children that have ADHD have a hard time with transitions, staying focused on playing with others and controlling their impulses.  They need a structured daily routine, they need to be told ahead of time what is going to happen and clear behavior limit setting by the parents and teachers (manage behavior with rewards and time-outs). You also need to minimize sugar in their diet as well as artificial coloring and preservatives. This is just the beginning of my suggesttions. Please do some research on ADHD/ADD. Good luck.

        He plays near other children, but inter-plays with them very little.  I was watching him closely today when another little boy came over to play with his cars.  He didn't talk to the other boy, though he would look at him. The other boy tried to interplay with my son, but my son rarely reciprocated his actions.  For ex., the other boy bumped the cars into my son's car, like they were crashing, but M just moved the cars away.  Then, M did move his cars towards the other boy, like he would play, but he didn't talk and it died off in a minute. After a short while, M started to avoid the boy.  I walked a short ways off and M ran over to me and motioned for pick me up (although he can talk). 

There are some boys he considers his ""friends"" at our homeschool co-op, but we haven't seen them since November.  I wasn't paying attention then, but I will look next time we see them at how much he plays with them as a friend. 

I have thought about ADHD before, because he can be very hyper at times, but he isn't hyper when he's doing what he likes.  He can play very focused and still when he's playing with trains or toy cars or his father's tools (with father watching, of course).  

Also, re: time-outs and rewards, they seem to have little effect on M, that is why it is so puzzling.  He doesn't seem to ""get it"" that he can't behave badly or can't throw a fit about everything.  I have been tightening up some things and he does respond better to it, but it's sad to me.  I'm finding that I can't give him little perks because then he wants that all the time, KWIM?  So, IOW, if I match his rigidity by being a more rigid mother than I am, things go better. I use the timer constantly to help with transitions.  It might help, but it doesn't eliminate transitional problems.

Also, I am particular about food and rarely give food/drink with artificial junk in it, and I limit sugar anyway. We eat homemade food and a lot of fruits and vegitables.

        Being evaluated for autism would be a good idea.  Chances are if he is autistic meds designed for treating ADHD won't be that effective.  At one time they thought I was something of the sort and perscribed ritlin...(however it is spelled)  Well that worked as a stimulant and only made things worse.

The way you describe your son playing sounds similar to how I played with people as a kid.  I'd play with my toys alongside them, but snot really engaging conversation or playing with them.  If I got bored of the game, I just up and left them to play by themselves.  Around age 10 I do remember playing with a few people I considered friends. At the time it seemed I played better with children younger than me.  Perhaps it has to do with the PDD NOS...  On the upside (and off topic) I found I could sometimes get others involved with an activity and ""assign"" them tasks.  I remember making a huge fort made out of boxes that way by recruiting neighborhood boys and telling them what supplies to get.

        It can be hard to diagnose - especially at 3.  My son is 9 and he has a little bit of this and a little bit of that - and even his doctor just says he has a touch of asperger's.  He definitely has ADHD - but none of the meds do anything for him so now we are on Tenex after 2 years of trial and error.  ADHD children are not always hyper - my son can read for hours on end.  He also pointed and can read faces - but he rarely makes eye contact.  He was very emotional - which the Tenex helped.  But a 3 year old is far harder to diagnose than a 9 year old.  

I You should never be afraid to have your child diagnosed.  I took him to three autism experts - and they stuill haven't figured it out - but they will point you in the right direction to get the help you need.  It is unusal to have such a highly verbal kid - can you talk to him - ours was also highly verbal which was a great help in keeping him calm.

At 6 he would have 45 minute temper tantrums when we turned off the tv (even though he knew by 4 how to read and program the TIVO).  Now he will rant and tell us he hates us for about a minute.  Better than 45 - we aren't looking for perfection - only improvement.

And cheer up. the two neurotypical kids were just as good at throwing temper tantrums - some of this is normal childhood development.  You should see the temper tantrum my 7 year old throws if I forget to book her horseback riding lesson - it is other things that are more telling.  Cheer up.

        Certainly sounds like Asperger's Syndrome to me. And no amount of yelling will help, it only makes her frustration worse. However, I can fully understand YOUR frustration which causes you to yell. 

I have Asperger's and so does my youngest daughter and your story could have been written by me when my daughter was ten.

Mine stopped bed wetting at nearly thirteen. Everything else you are saying is just like my daughter. 

Encourage her in whatever her special interest is and just remember that she will grow up one day, whether she talked and played, or just walked around at recess. 

Love her for the unique person she is and try to keep her bedroom a calm relaxing place where she can de-stress from her day of having to be with other people. Good luck.

        I just found out yesterday that she doesn't talk at all in school.  If a teacher calls on her she won't say anything she just sits there as if no one has said anything to her.  She also has been sent to the guidance counselor office 4 times this year because they couldn't get her to stop crying. The counselor has been going into class rooms to observe her and see how she interacts with other kids. They have stopped talking to her directly and they think it is a good if she says hi to them.  No one at the school has ever called me.

        Sertraline (brand name Zoloft) is a type of an antidepressant known as a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor.  It is sometimes prescribed to treat anxiety disorders and it sounds like this is the reason that your son is on the medication.  While tics are not a common side effect of Zoloft, any concerns that you have regarding your son’s medication should be brought to the attention of the doctor prescribing the medication immediately.   With children diagnosed with autism-spectrum disorders, it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate tics from stereotypy or some forms of self-injurious behavior.  Consider taking your son to a specialist in involuntary movement disorders.  A specialist in the area should be able to better tell if what your son is exhibiting is, in fact a tic, and identify appropriate treatment.

1679,I don't even know where to begin..,"
        Jen,

Your situation sounds very challenging with many distinct problems and it is hard for me to figure out where to begin.  First and foremost, you ask about the role of a psychologist in this situation.  I'll assume that you already have a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), if not, I suggest that you find a developmental pediatrician/pediatric neurologist or a developmental psychologist/psychiatrist that specializes in assessment and has experience with children with autism.  For a child with significant issues, such as those you mention, there should be specific intervention plans that stem from appropriate assessment of their problem behaviors and with measurable treatment goals.  If the psychologist has not written any reports or relayed specific intervention plans you should request them.  If they are unwilling to do so you may want to find a qualified person who will help develop specific plans of treatment and provide training and support for implementing them.

It is my opinion that the most qualified person to develop educational and clinical planning for a child with ASD is a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA).  Borrowing from another blog entry: regarding the problem behavior, although medication can, in some cases, be effective in suppressing problem behavior in children diagnosed with ASDs, the intervention that has been shown to be most reliably effective is applied behavior analysis.  Over 30 years of rigorous experimental evidence has shown that children can learn appropriate alternatives to severe problem behavior given the right teaching arrangement.  Behavior analytic interventions typically involve identifying the situations that are most problematic for a child and the things that are most rewarding and systematically teaching a child more appropriate ways of handling problematic situations and of obtaining reinforcing things and events.  These interventions are individualized to the needs of the particular child and, with the right services, the prognosis for treatment of severe problem behavior can be quite good.  I recommend that you look into identifying a BCBA who has experience treating behavior problems exhibited by children diagnosed with ASDs.  You could start at the certificant registry on the BACB website: http://www.bacb.com/ 

On the feeding issue, I have extensive experience in pediatric feeding disorders and have provided services for over 40 cases of children with ASD failing to transition from liquids to solids, the problem more often than not isn't physiological.  Children with ASD resist changes in routine and experience more feeding problems than do children without ASD.  However, they tend to experience the same kinds of feeding problems, food selectivity, most often experienced by typically developing children.  Solid food refusal is one form of selective acceptance.  A BCBA with experience with feeding problems would be a good person to work with on this issue.  However, several other disciplines can also work effectively with feeding difficulties.  I suggest you seek out an assessment from a pediatric feeding disorders clinic in your area.

Celiac disorder was mentioned in another reply.  This is a rare condition and is not more likely to occur in persons with an ASD.

Best of luck

        Dear Jennifer,

I have been at this for 4 years now.  We are a little bit closer - he may have a mild case of Asbergers - but the label is not as imortant as the treatment.  Not all children are ""waiting room diagnosis"" as one doctor likes to say.

It can be frustrating - we have spent over $25,000 ourselves.  You may want to look into participating in some studies.  We have done one or two and they tell you the test results.  Many major medical centers are involved.  We got a $4,000 celiac test done for free (he was gluten intolerant), free IQ and autism testing, and other things.  NYU was going to send ABA specialists to help him in class for feww (until the teacher shot it down).  He is going to be going to school soon - defiitely get all your doctors to write reports becuase it sounds like he is going to need an extensive IEP.  Sometimes family counseling and therapy can be added on and paid for by the state.  You are better than me - I hid my head in the sand until he was in first grade because he was quite a clever lad.  We were hoping he would grow out of it - he didn't - but it is much better now.  

Sam takes Tenex too.  It isn't always a panacea but it does help.

Good luck.

        It certainly sounds like this child could benefit from a full diagnostic evaluation by a screening team associated with a medical or educational center to identify possible developmental issues.  If there are delay issues the child will make more progress if these are identified early with concomitant early-intervention strategies.  If he is in preschool and has problems compared to other children and his teachers and you and other family members think he has delay issue I would certainly discuss this with his parents.  However, as you have noted, his parents may not be receptive to this feedback and I think it is, in the last analysis, up to them to initiate the evaluation.

        I appreciate your frustration with your son’s diagnosis. You have certainly worked hard to identify professionals who can give you some answers. If you have not done so already, be certain to have your son evaluated by a professional with experience in diagnosing Asperger’s Disorder and other Pervasive Developmental Disorders. In the meantime, it will be important to work with your son’s school to give him the support that he needs to be successful. Although a diagnosis is necessary for securing some services, there are some fairly simple environmental changes that can help children to succeed in school. You have already identified a consistent routine and picture schedule as effective approaches. There may be some additional strategies that you could develop in conjunction with the school to improve his social behavior and broaden his interests. I would certainly recommend that you try this approach before agreeing to any medication. If you do decide to try medication with your son, be sure to help the psychiatrist to evaluate the effects of the medication by tracking concerning behavior before and during the medication.

1688,any connection between developmental disorders & duarte galactosemia?,"
        I'll start with the question on the Duarte variant of galactosemia.  It is a milder form of galactosemia.  This condition is an inherited disorder that affects how the body processes certain sugars. This condition results in the body not being able to process the sugar galactose, which is found in many foods. Galactose also exists as part of another sugar, lactose, found in all dairy products. Liver dysfunction, cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye), speech problems, and mental impairment are characteristic of this condition if not treated.

For more information about galactosemia go to the following link:

http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=galactosemia

Whether there is any connection between autism and this condition, I have not been able to locate any published literature on this topic.  Galactosemia is a pretty rare condition with the Duarte variant occuring in 1 out of every 16,000 births.  Given that it is inherited and can result in or be correlated with mental impairment, this is certainly a valid question.  However, it is certainly the case that if galactosemia is still an issue, treatment is necessary.  Please consult your grandson's pediatrician.

As to your grandson's behavior, there are many indicators that his development may show some signs of autism.  He should be screened by a developmental specialist.  A psychiatrist may not be the most qualified individual to conduct developmental testing.  For more information about developmental screening, I suggest you go to the following link:

1689,Autism and Ultrasounds,"
        There have been no investigations looking at a possible connection between autism and ultrasounds because it is highly improbable that there is any relation.  While it is true that sonograms have become a more common technique, however, these are very useful and safe tests.  One application of ultrasonography is to assess development during pregnancy.  According to the National Institutes of Health MedlinePlus medical dictionary:

Some physicians order an ultrasound when an abnormality is suspected, while others advocate screening ultrasounds. You should consult your health care provider to determine the most appropriate scanning schedule for you.

Scans may be performed in the first trimester to:

Confirm a normal pregnancy 
Assess the baby's age 
Rule out abnormalities, such as ectopic pregnancies or potential for miscarriage 
Assess the baby's heart 
See if there are multiple pregnancies 
Identify abnormalities of the placenta, uterus, and other pelvic structures 
Scans may also be obtained in the second and third trimesters to:

Assess the baby's age, growth, position, and sometimes gender 
Identify any developmental problems 
Rule out multiple pregnancies 
Evaluate the placenta, amniotic fluid, and remaining structures of the pelvis 
Some centers are now performing a scan at around 13-14 weeks of pregnancy to look for risks for Down Syndrome (which causes mental retardation) or other developmental abnormalities in the fetus.

The total number of scans will vary depending on whether a previous scan or blood tests have detected abnormalities that require follow-up assessment.

There are no known risks to the mother or the developing child.  For more information go to:

1692,Refuses to poop on the toilet,"
        Many children show resistance to having bowel movements on the toilet. This experience appears pretty frightening for many of these children. And, as you identified, control seems to play a part in some cases as well. As children develop, they seem to figure out quickly that there are a small number of things that adults can’t control, and they struggle to maintain control of those things (e.g., eating, eliminating). I admire the approach that you have taken thus far. When children resist having bowel movements on the toilet it is often best to move them gradually from their current situation toward the ultimate goal of eliminating on the toilet. As you experienced, you are likely to encounter a great deal of resistance if you move too quickly. There are a few additional techniques that you might try.

First, to reduce the extent to which this is an anxiety provoking experience, be sure that your son is as comfortable as possible on the toilet. For example, there are child-sized seats that can be placed over the regular toilet seat that make children feel more secure. Some children also benefit from having a stool at their feet so that their legs don’t dangle. If he prefers, allow your son to remove his pants and underwear so that they are not at his ankles. Make sure that the bathroom is warm, and allow your son access to books or music if that helps.

Second, begin by having your son sit on the toilet when he is not ready for a bowel movement. This will allow him to get comfortable with sitting. I assume that your son stands to urinate. I also recommend that you provide some type of reward for sitting calmly on the toilet. Start with very small periods (e.g, a second or two) and allow your son access to some small reward (e.g., a piece of candy or access to a favorite toy or movie) for meeting this goal. Then, gradually extend the time requirement until he sits on the toilet for approximately 5 minutes. At this point, it may be possible to arrange the award only if he has a bowel movement on the toilet.

Third, attempt to give him as much control as appropriate during the toileting routine. You might ask him if he wants to sit on the toilet now or in 5 minutes. If you have more than one bathroom, you might allow him to choose the bathroom. If you allow him to look at a book, you might let him choose the book.

If he is only willing to sit on the toilet in a pull-up, allow him to do this at first. This is still progress.

Regardless of the diagnosis, you will want to be sure that you and your child have the support that you need.

        We're getting a number of questions regarding the effects of medication on problem behavior in children diagnosed with autism.  In a nut shell, medication has been shown to be effective in some cases.  I would advise you to make sure that you are working with a doctor who has experience proscribing these medications for children with diagnoses similar to your child's.  Make sure you are comfortable with the way that the meds are being proscribed, monitored, and evaluated.  If you aren't seek a second opinion.  I would also advise you to seek a qualified behavior analyst in your area.  This should be someone who is a board certified behavior analyst and has experience treating problem behavior in children diagnosed with ASDs.  A psychotropic medication should be used in conjunction with systematic teaching procedures designed to help your child learn more effective ways of tolerating and handling problematic situations.  An answer that I gave in a previous thread is copied below in case you might find it helpful.


It is not uncommon for children diagnosed with an ASD to emit severe problem behavior.  

Regarding the medication, make sure that you are working with a proscriber that you are comfortable with.  The doctor supervising the use of the medication should be explaining to you exactly what a medication is targeting for your children, how the effects of the medication will be measured, and what the overall plan is for determining if the medication is successful.  For example, the plan might be to target the child’s aggression with risperidone, starting at a certain dose and titrating the dose upward to a certain point until either a clinically significant effect is observed (in which case, you’re convinced that the child is on the right med at the right dose) or a clinically significant effect has not been observed (in which case, you’re convinced that the child is not on the right med and the med should be removed).  Make sure that you’re clear on the plan, data collection system, and reasons why decisions are being made.  If you’re not happy with the proscribing doctor, seek a second opinion.  Look for a physician is one that has experience proscribing psychotropic medication to individuals diagnosed with ASDs.

        It is not uncommon for children diagnosed with an ASD to emit severe problem behavior.  

Regarding the medication, make sure that you are working with a proscriber that you are comfortable with.  The doctor supervising the use of the medication should be explaining to you exactly what a medication is targeting for your children, how the effects of the medication will be measured, and what the overall plan is for determining if the medication is successful.  For example, the plan might be to target the child’s aggression with risperidone, starting at a certain dose and titrating the dose upward to a certain point until either a clinically significant effect is observed (in which case, you’re convinced that the child is on the right med at the right dose) or a clinically significant effect has not been observed (in which case, you’re convinced that the child is not on the right med and the med should be removed).  Make sure that you’re clear on the plan, data collection system, and reasons why decisions are being made.  If you’re not happy with the proscribing doctor, seek a second opinion.  Look for a physician is one that has experience proscribing psychotropic medication to individuals diagnosed with ASDs.

Regarding the problem behavior, although medication can, in some cases, be effective in suppressing problem behavior in children diagnosed with ASDs, the intervention that has been shown to be most reliably effective is applied behavior analysis.  Over 20 years of rigorous experimental evidence has shown that children can learn appropriate alternatives to severe problem behavior given the right teaching arrangement.  Behavior analytic interventions typically involve identifying the situations that are most problematic for a child and the things that are most rewarding and systematically teaching a child more appropriate ways of handling problematic situations and of obtaining reinforcing things and events.  These interventions are individualized to the needs of the particular child and, with the right services, the prognosis for treatment of severe problem behavior can be quite good.  I recommend that you also look into identifying a board certified behavior analyst who has experience treating behavior problems exhibited by children diagnosed with ASDs.  You could start at the certificant registry on the BCBA website: http://www.bacb.com/

        I wish medicatiin was the answer.  It wasn't for us - the aphentamines made him worse.   We are down to Tenex (it works like clonidine) - at least that helps with the impulse control. 

We spent two years taking applied behvaioral management classes geared for parents - that worked out pretty well.  He probably has the longest IEP ever devised.  We put him in a special ed school designed for children with neurobiological disorders but that is a very hard route to go (and it is an expensive process) so try to work with your school system first.  But it was the right choice for us.  We used to be a neurotic, unhappy screaming family of a mess.  One with ASD and ADHD and another with Tourette's, ADHD and OCD (non-medicated but with probably try ritalin soon).  Now we are a much happier family.  But it was a long road.

Cheer up - it gets better. Last year his regular school tried to haul my 8 year old off in the paddy wagon in a straight jacket.  (assisted by four large NYC policeman) - that was June.  Six months later - with the right supports and environment - we have a happy kid again.

Your kids are on alot of different medications - I hope you are seeing a child phsychiatrist who has a speciality in pharmapsychology.  

You are really going to have to look at your life and make alot of choices when dealing with this.  We have walked out of supermarkets with full grocery baskets (and made them eat rice and beans for an entire week because we had ""no food"") , we have cancelled Hannukah (and really meant it - my husband actually cried), walked out of movie theaters (and given away the tickets in front of then to another family) and major amusement parks five minutes after paying (and we are a family of five) because the behavior was inappropriate.  We have walked right back into stores and returned things that we had bought 10 minutes before - well, you get the point.  thye are beginning to learn that their behavior has consequences.

On the other hand, rewards are meaningful and usually immediate.  we do it by the day - not the week.  Everyday is a new day.  The reward is as big as a horseback riding lesson or just sitting and watching my son play his favorite computer game for a 1/2 hour.  No grudges - this isn't personal.  

It took us 2 years to get our life back.  It was work. You can also get yours back.  Good luck.

        My think you should get more information from the providers about behaviors they are concerned about.  Does he always play alone and does he do other things that they think are indicators of autism?  You mention that he had speech delays; since his ears were treated is he talking like a typical 3 year old?  If you are concerned at all I would pursue a diagnostic evaluation;  if interventions are needed they are best started when a child is young.  I would start by talking to his pediatrician; if that person is not experienced with autism then I would ask for a second pediatric opinion.

        I really think you need to pursue a follow-up diagnosis with a child psychiatrist and developmental pediatrician who have experience with a variety of children with ASD and other developmental and emotional/behavioral issues.  I do not know what supports are available to you but would check with the school system (some systems have guidance programs and some towns/cities have intervention teams) and health insurance for a source of other providers whose diagnostic services will be covered.  I cannot give you a diagnosis but your descriptions of his behaviors and your concerns lead me to believe that you need and have every right to expect help.

        I would definiately encourage the parents to have her evaluated.  The ""falling down for no reason"" is a major red flag for me, because a friend of mine had that with her son and soon after he was having full-blown seizures.  The ""falling down"" was probably petite mal seizures that weren't recognized as seizures at first.  The other things you mention do sound like autism, certainly enough to warrant evaluation.  Are the parents open to hearing your concerns? 

I would go first to the girl's pediatrician with concerns.  But the parents must OVEREMPHASIZE their concerns to get the pediatrician to pay attention some times.

        I am sure this answer is not particularly useful anymore since I assume, given the delay, that he is no longer clenching his hands.  If this has occurred more than once I would have him checked by your pediatrician who is hopefully a developmental pediatrician with expertise with autism.  Ruling out medical issues you have probably encountered an unusual form of stereotypic behavior which I would try to redirect to handling some toy materials to see if you can get him interested in other sensory experiences.

        It's hard to tell. It depends on the severity of the disorder with your son. Autism is a spectrum disorder. Looking for a cause is going to send you in several directions, because the cause isn't known. My suggestion is not to waste your time looking for a cause and instead focus your attention on what you can do.

        Hi,
sounds a lot like my child who is now 4.  when she was 2 she could do 48 piece puzzles and knew the alphabet but could not stand hugs and was sort of lost.  she does not really have a speech delay, but a delay in other areas.  At 3 she was dx with PDD-NOS  ""pervasive development disorder, not otherwise specificed"" because she did not fit nicely into any category.  She did not have above normal/normal language skills which would have given her the asperger's dx i think.
I would go with your gut.  Forget those docs and go to another.  If I had it to do over again, i woudl forget the developmental pediatrician and take her straight to a DAN! doctor.  (defeat autism now)
It will work out, but do follow your gut.  You know your child better than anyone else.  And, you know that time is important here, and if you get treatment sooner than later it could make a huge difference.

        I understand how you feel. It's really disillusioning to expect a very scientific, thorough evaluation and to instead have your observations and concerns dismissed. I had the same thing happen to me, and came to conclusion I had to trust my observations more than those of the doctors, (and yet not let any of the doctors know that I did not consider their opinions to be divinely inspired ;-) because I am the person who observes my child day in and day out. The doctors usually see your child for 45 minutes, and their diagnoses are not nearly as objective as they'd like everyone to believe. 

Unfortunately, I think that happens a lot with children younger than about 4 years old because the problems haven't come into clear enough focus and can be confused with many other things. So, instead of being very thorough and meticulous with their diagnoses, many of the ""experts"" tend to lapse into making off the cuff decisions. Sometimes, their status is what causes them to be so arrogant, so sometimes you are better off with someone younger or not necessarily considered to be an expert. 

They think they can just glance at a child and know what their diagnosis should be, despite the fact that none of the illnesses are exactly diagnosed. Behavioral, developmental disorders are all a matter of subjective opinion about how far a person strays into the continuum of ""disordered"" rather than normal.

Though it is frustrating to not knwo for sure, it is only fair for the professional and the child to be more certain. I had the diagnoses by age 4 so hang in there. I have a son serving in the army as well and he did this same behavior and is now fine! Just was a bit odd in peer relations and accepting affection, he outgrew it and is the most loving affectionate adult son.

I am so glad I did not have him diagnosed or his dream to serve in the military woudl have never happened. Not having the diagnoses on yrou son wil nto stop you from early intervention. You can still do so much for him with  this concern at home or with private therapy. God Bless.

        Dear Rebecca,

I posted above and it sounds like you and I are in similar straits.  My son who is 9 has also been throught the gauntlet of experts.  I suggest you get a NESPY done.  He also had a test for autism.  I will admit that tye were also inconclusive but it did help s understand what his deficits were.  Medication has also been a complete bust for us.  Lately he is on Tenex - which does little for the attentional deficit but it has kept his impulse and emotions under control (to some extent as none of these pills are a panacea).  Prozac did not work at all (he gained weight and became very disinhibited on it) which is pointing to an underlying mood disorder.  

The NESPY pretty much brought out that he suffered from executive dysfunction.  This is a trait that overlaps with Asbergers - so again - it is hard to tell.  But none of these things would have shown up on the psych-education evaluation that the school did.  Our school psychologist begged us to have it done privately.  The state doesn't allow her to give one because it would uncover too many deficits in children.  If you can afford it take him to a neuropsychologist for testing.  Be prepared, it is a long grueling test and it came in at $3,600 (NYC - may be cheaper elsewhere).  Sometimes the major hospitals in your area will haveCHild Development Centers - they are the best way to go.  If nothing else, they are very helpful in constructing an IEP for your child.

His psychiatrist who has a large Asperger's client base also thinks he has a touch of Aspergers - but he is not a ""waiting room"" diagnosis.  She admitted there was a bit of a stretch to it. His behavior fails to fufill any criteria totally which means they love trying clinical trials on him.  Currently we have him labeled as Emotional Disturbed because it opened the flood gates for services (no - he doesn't torture animals or fight kids - he is just inflexible and unmotivated to perform in school).  As my advocate says, I would label them swiss cheese if it gets them the services they need.

We did find out - in a major study for ADHD children - that he was gluten intolerant.  We cut out the gluten and that improved his behavior somewhat.  It was only 10% but that was better than nothing.  So if your child is having skin problems, allergies, or toilet troubles you should have a blood test.  They found that a very high number of the children with severe ADHD were gluten intolerant (but did not have celiac).  

In the end we hired an advocate service.  Even though my husband is a lawyer we felt it was best to procur a professional in this matter.  They can at least help you identify programs within your school system and those privately based that will help your child.  Ours sent us to Gersh which isn't even on the map, but it was known for bright children with social issues.  Don't be afraid to get him evaluated and then demand the services he needs.  You can even get the school board to pay for some of these tests.  Also, ask for a Functional Behavior Analysis for the classroom.  You can also ask for an Adaptive Technology assessment.  Luckily, our insurance company surprised us and picked it up.  We had the psychiatrist write a request.   

His school is currently using the methodology of Dr. Greene's ""The Explosive Child.""  Dr Greene is at Harvard and my son's psychologist (we have a ton of professionals for him) assures me that his methodology is sound.  He published his data after the original came out - unlike many other of these books that are ancedotal.  His school, Gersh Academy, uses his collabrative problem solving methods.  The school is in high demand for their advice in setting up programs because of their phenomenol record in helping children like ours.  Along with intensive parent training and this book's philosophy we have brought our struggles down to a minimum (an no - I don't get kickbacks from either groups.  

Take care.  We cried alot of tears and ate a lot of chocolate these past few years.  This year has been incredible.  He is thriving in a therauputic environment.  I do not know how your child is coping so take our case as an extreme one.  Just be assured that their is hope out there.  

One of our best days was the school's annual gathering.  We met a lot of parents with children who were so much like Sam.  We laughed and sometimes almost cried (especially when talking about the pain our children endured in other settings).  But the most obvious trait was the passion in advocating for our children.  Many of us went from being nice parents to becoming difficult nightmares that made school administrators shake in their boots. 

My biggest advice is stop being nice - always be polite - but stop being nice.  School social workers don't tell you have of your rights.  Also, document everything that goes on between you and your school just in case you do decide to go the private route.

        I have a 9-year-old son who is also complex.  His teachers have always said they don't believe he is ADHD (could be the grape seed with gingko he's been taking since age 4) but his second grade teacher mentioned Aspergers 2 years ago.  The Christian counselor he was seeing mentioned it as well and his last pyschological evaluation brought it up 3 times, however as I said, he is very complex.  People have also suggested he is depressed, possibly bipolar, and friends who have ADHD kids think that is his problem (even though his teachers don't see it).  ALL of these mental issues are HIGHLY subjective, which is why we have chosen NOT to medicate as belonging to forums like this teaches me that many times you have to try a LOT of different things, and sometimes the results make things worse and not better.  I especially appreciate the comment about gluten intolerance as my son has an issue with pooping and insists he does not know when it is going to happen (even says it happened last night while he was asleep).  I will have that checked out.  We also took him to a chiropractor/kinesiologist, who said that he has a problem with sugar and dairy.  We pretty much restricted those 2 things for 3 weeks, and didn't really see a big change behavior-wise, but he did lose a few pounds and after Christmas I intend to take him off of that again (and gluten as well if we can do it - that's a hard one, but we can try our best).  He is a good, sweet, kid - just is very easily frustrated, and gets extremely angry when other children do not follow the rules in games (although his troubles only seem to happen at school).  Once he gets upset, so far, there's no stopping it - although I really think there has to be a way that we just haven't discovered yet.  He is extremely intelligent - especially verbally (tested in the 99.9th percentile in his evaluation), so I really think there has to be a way to get a handle on this without drugs.  I have a friend I consult with about natural alternatives, as well as a local health food store who is managed by an ADHD adult.  I give my son a very good multi-vitamin, a High DHA Omega 3 (which I'm told has shown to be effective in some with bipolar), and a grape seed/gingko supplement.  I also just added magnesium as if you check out www.krispin.com and look at the section on magnesium you will see a lot of different things that can be a result of magnesium difficiency.  My son also still wets the bed (although among boys that is somewhat common, and hereditary as well, so although it is sometimes an annoyance, I am not so concerned about that - we just do a lot of laundry!).  He also does not sleep well - usually goes to bed early - between 7 and 8pm, but is almost ALWAYS up by 5am (I'm sure that will change once he hits puberty - but I actually won't be upset if it doesn't!)  He almost always wakes up at least once at night - and sometimes 2 or 3 times.  Anyway - I really enjoy these forums as it gives us all the opportunity to share experiences etc.

        I take it back - I DO notice a difference when my son is not eating sugar (didn't notice how much until he had some again).  He still had episodes at school (but I'm told the withdrawal can sometimes be a challenge - and it would take at least 3 weeks).  Taking sugar out of the diet CAN help and I intend to take it away completely as of the new year, and limit it severely until then (sweets only on Christmas and New Years Eve).  The hard part is that all of his friends eat it (and probably too much) and getting him to understand why he can't.  Most of his friends have some of the same issues he does, and it is likely that if they were restricted totaly from sugar, their behavior may be better as well. If anybody has any ideas on restriction and getting a child to understand and cooperate, let me know!

As an 8 year old I went through a struggle at school. If I remember right I was going from a good school back into a grade school that knew next to nothing how to deal with autism... People picking on me for being different, etc. Not to mention I had severe hay fever allergies, which only made it more difficult.

        Hopefully times have changed. This was in a school that confused my autism as an emotional disturbance problem and treated me that way.  I haven't visited the school in a long time and probably won't because of the location, but I heard they were starting to improve.  I think generally there's more awareness of autism than there was ten years ago.  Still you have to be on the watch and make sure to set up IEP's and keep in close contact with your son's teachers. My dad really helped by staying on top of it. (You can find us on the autism forum here for more imput and advise)

Asperger's never has a language delay associated with it. A bright kid with the a trouble communicating and speaking at age 4 would definitely be PDD-NOS or classic Autism.

1749,obssive chewing,"
        The problem you’re describing can be considered to be a type of habit disorder.  These types of disorders are not uncommon among both individuals diagnosed with an autism-spectrum disorder and individuals without these diagnoses. Other habit disorders that you may have heard of or encountered include thumb sucking, fingernail biting, and hair pulling.  These are topographies of behavior that may occur quite frequently without the individual engaging in them being aware that they are happening.  One of the most successful forms of treatment for these types of behavior is habit reversal (Azrin & Nunn, 1973).  Habit reversal is typically composed of four phases: (1) awareness training, (2) competing response training, (3) motivation procedures, and (4) generalization procedures.  

The training might initially be done by taking an hour of your day each evening, sitting down with the child, and practicing.  Awareness training is designed to teach the individual to identify each time that the behavior occurs.  This might be done by having the individual practice emitting the response and having the individual watch you and identify when you are emitting the response.  Five-minute sessions of practicing emitting the response and identifying your emitting the response might be followed by an extended period of more naturalistic training (for example, spending 20 minutes with your child watching TV or a favorite movie with items that he might typically chew on around, pointing out each time he engages in the behavior, and having him point out each time he engages the behavior or begins to engage in the behavior).  It can be a good idea to incorporate self monitoring and have him keep track of how many times in a day he catches himself chewing on objects.  This can be a project that you and he work on and touch base on daily.  You might consider having him keep track of these data and graph the number of times that he emits the behavior each day.  This can help him become more aware of his behavior and may also result in decreases in the chewing.

Competing response training involves teaching him to do something else when he notices that he’s chewing or about to place an object in his mouth.  This might be something like chewing on a piece of gum instead, manipulating a stress ball with his hand, or just putting his hands in his pockets.  Once the awareness training is done, it is also possible to have him start to keep track of how often he emits the competing response rather than the chewing.  By having him keep track of these data and possibly graphing them, your child will be able to see the progress he’s making daily.

Motivation procedures are those that help motivate the individual to participate in the treatment.  For your son, this might involve setting some goals (for example, chewing on objects less than ten times per day) and then arranging particular rewards for meeting the goals.  For a successful day or week, this could involve going out to a movie, dinner, or any other activity that he enjoys.  

Generalization procedures are designed to help the intervention spread into novel contexts.  It might be the case that you are able to get him to not chew items when you are around, but it might be that he does chew items when you are not.  One way of accomplishing this is to recruit other members of your family and perhaps your son’s teachers to help with the treatment.  If he is receiving praise and support for emitting competing responses rather than chewing by a variety of people in a variety of settings, it is more likely that the treatment will generalize.

It is crucial that you stick with it and that you and your son are practicing the components of the treatment frequently and regularly (ideally daily).  If you are having continued difficulty, I would recommend seeking out a behavior analyst in your area who has experience treating habit disorders to help with implementation and monitoring of the treatment.

        You sound really concerned and perplexed but you do not mention any evaluation or diagnosis by your pediatrician or any school personnel.  Have you spoken to your pediatrician or the school guidance department about your concerns?  I think that you should follow-up on having a full team evaluation through your school system or with a developmental pediatrician to see if she meets any diagnostic criteria.  She certainly does seem to be gifted and it may just be that regular school programs do not interest  her.  On the other hand some of her behaviors are suggestive and a diagnosis may help you access resources to help her educational options.  I encourage you to contact professionals until you get some answers that help you understand her better, if that is possible.

        I am not a doctor but I have volunteered with children with autism and Asperger's syndrome and I have a cousin with autism...and your daughter's behaviours certainly sound like they fall into this category. I am surprised that she has not been evaluated over the years. My neighbour's daughter who has some autistic traits is a history whiz.  She knows about every period in history and facts and dates...it is incredible.  She reads the newspaper every mornin from front to back and she goes onto history sites and watches history documentaries. She is very stubborn, oftentimes difficult although her parents are very strict and consistent with her so she has learned manners and other social skills...but she cannot even do simple math or tie her shoe. Her parents remind her all the time to look at whoever she is talking to. Your daughter sounds high functioning so there is hope that with treatment she could come 'round and be able to lead a productive life. Personally, if I had a child with any difficulties, I would home school him or her.  My experience is that children who are home schooled are kinder and gentler than those who are sent to school where they are often sidelined and rejected and experience learning difficulties. Another friend has a child who could be called a slow learner.  She sent her to school where she was teased and rejected even in grade one. She cried so much and withdrew and changed from a happy child to a depressed child. My friend decided to keep  her home and teach her and the child became the happy, sweet and innocent child that she was.  Being teased and tormented makes children put up defenses and walls and hardens them and makes them aggressive.  So consider 'hothousing' your daughter and enriching her life with an education geared to her interests.  You can get together with other families for certain activities so that she has the peer interaction under supervision. It sounds like your daughter is a special little person who with the right nurturing could become quite an interesting adult who can function very well in society.  Good luck! BlueEgg

1755,Confused Diagnosis,"
        Seeing that your child is struggling and being unable to get a definitive diagnosis has to be one of the most frustrating experience a parent can have (although it may be tied with being unable to find the “right” program for them).  

From your description of the professionals who have seen your son, it seems as though you have been very thorough.  One of the difficulties in differential diagnosis of children similar to the way you describe your son is that all of the purported diagnoses you mention are behaviorally defined (therefore there is no “blood test” or other biological marker to definitively settle the question of diagnosis).  Therefore the best professional to diagnosis a person on the spectrum is someone with the proper credentials who has years of experience observing, evaluating, and working with persons on the spectrum and their families.  If the “autism expert” met these criteria and did not diagnose your son on the spectrum, then I would believe her.  

You asked several questions: 

How does one compensate for lacking a “Theory of Mind”?  
Theory of mind is a construct to help describe a number of behavior deficits is some people; typically related to perspective taking, joint attention, etc.  These skills, or at least rudimentary components of these skills, can be taught to many individuals.  While some may argue that teaching these skills does not address some “core deficit”, instruction in the behaviors that constitute the criteria for concluding an individual lacks a “Theory of Mind” are extremely helpful.  

How does one know if one is dealing with a highly gifted child with an inflexible personality or a child with Aspergers? 
Once again I would rely on the diagnosticians.  A gifted child with an inflexible personality should be quite different than I would also encourage you to look at the functional impact of your child’s behavior.  Another issue is what exactly constitutes “gifted.”  

Why do the boards say gifted or Aspergers (he has no particular interest he is obsessed with) - can you be gifted and also have Aspergers.
Part of the criteria for a diagnosis of Aspergers does include a restricted and repetitive behavior or interests.  I believe it is entirely possible to have a diagnosis of Aspergers and perform well above average on one or more areas on traditional cognitive or academic assessments.  

His comprehension (99.9%) and his inference abilities (89%) are pretty high - wouldn't that rule out Aspergers?  
I do not believe that these scores are incompatible with a diagnosis of Aspergers.  Depending on where you have derived the percent scores you cite, the comprehension and inferential behavior on the assessment may be different than the comprehension and inferential behavior that is assessed for a diagnosis of Aspergers (particularly regarding inferential tasks).  

His psychiatrist is willing to re-diagnose him - but does it really matter? 
It certainly matters with respect to accessing particular services and the manner in which a treatment is approached.  I would encourage you, however, to look carefully at your child’s individual needs by carefully assessing both the behaviors that interfere with him demonstrating his 
Could an autism diagnosis limit further career potentials?
I really don’t know that answer to that question, although it is certainly a valid concern.  As your first concern is to be certain that your child is receiving the services he needs to reach his full potential; I would continue to look for help in that area.  If there is a particular diagnosis that “fits” your child, and helps direct those responsible for his education and treatment, then I would accept the diagnosis and move forward.

Thank you for your response.  We don't know if he is autistic - neither do the doctors.  We aren't scared of a diagnosis.  We have had autism experts look at him for over 3 years and they are confused.  They can't figure out is it autism or just a rigid personality.  His ability to make inferences is incredible - something an autisitic person supposedly cannot to - but one doctor has seen a few exceptions.  We are just wondering if it is worth the bother to get him classified as such or just leave him as ADHD/OHI.

I thank you for your response.  As I am learning, it is not the label but the help.  We put him into the Gersh Academy which specializes in Asperger's children.  They use Dr. Greene's methodology of collabrative problem solving which Sam seems to be excelling with.  As far as gifted, except for his writing skills, Sam, who is 9, can pretty much do the academic work of a 10th grader.  His global IQ is about a 150.  They used the NESPY the last time around.  He has amazing strengths and then some equally amazing deficits in many of the tests that test executive function.  His ADHD, which is severe in a large classroom setting, is practically non-existent when it comes to doing school work at home.  He is currently in a school that mostly focuses on children's with Aspergers.  It is academically challenging and the class size is a 4:1:1.  He is very productive there but still occassionally feels that he is not required to do work that is too easy for him - ex. vocabulary, spelling, certain math problems.    When Sam decides it is not neccessary - then all hell breaks loose.  He doesn't transition well.  He argues like a Philadelphia lawyer - and he sees everything in a legalistic manner.  Everything needs to be contractual - and he keeps you to the letter.  Of course, he can violate his own agreements.

Though he knows what is socially expected of him - his own needs always supercede everyone elses.  And at times, he does not seem to understand socially appropriate behavior - i.e. - he may comment on someone's looks, etc.  One example is that he saw a very petite man who kept his hair long.   The man had an extremely high voice to boot.   He thought he was a woman and we had to literally pull him away as he was explaining to the poor gentleman why he mistook him as a woman.  He just won't let something like that go.  We always know when it is coming because he prefaces such  remarks - ""I don't mean to offend you but.....""  At times, I am practically yelling INAPPROPRIATE.  

As I said, the doctors are a bit confounded with Sam.  At times, he acts perfectly normal and then there are other times when he seems to be very much on the spectrum.  NYU has pretty much passed him around to all of their experts - so I guess this diagnosing thing is tougher than it seems.  Medications have been pretty useless.

Well, thank you for your time and effort.  I ams till trying to figure out this complicated child.  We both come from families of engineers where ""it is not rocket science"" actually has meaning.  Honestly, there have been a lot of antisocial types running around.  We are looking back at all the quirky, but productive people in our family and just hope Sam will turn out to be one of them.

        Certainly some of the behaviors you describe fall in line with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.  It is great that you child is already receiving speech services since improving communication skills is central to treatment.  I would try to get him evaluated as soon as possible.  Good choices for evaluation include developmental pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, child psychiatrists and child psychologists.  It will also be extremely important to get services from professionals who have experience developing intervention plans for children with these difficulties which are approrpiate to the diagnosis you get and to the behaviors and deficits you describe.

Good Luck.

        Is there any way that you can get him in to see a Developmental Pediatrician where you live?  Or perhaps have your GP refer him for other types of therapy such as Play therapy or Occupational Therapy (deals with his sensory issues).  My son has been in therapy (O/T, S/T and Play Therapy) for 1 1/2 years, and he still doesn't have a  ""diagnosis"".  Reilly can still receive all of the therapy services as an autistic child might receive, without having a diagnosis.  The reason why alot of doctors are hesitant to ""put a label"" on a child such as AUTISM, is because alot of medical insurances DO NOT cover treatment of autism.  Although they will cover these same type of services for a child who may simply have been diagnosed with ""developmental delays"", or ""sensory integration disorder"".  It is frustrating I know.  Do whatever you need to do though for your child; it is their future that you need to advocate for.  The parent is the best one to do it.  Don't wait for a ""diagnosis"" before you request services for him.  The earlier the intervention, the better.  Be encouraged.  :)

        First off, I would ignore Atto786's comment.  The book referenced is full of unsubstantiated information about dubious interventions.

You mention sleep and seizure problems.  The best place for you to get answers to those questions would be at the sleep forum:

Or the MedlinePlus site on sleep disorders:

Sleep apnea:

Seizures:

        A great book to read that has info similar to what your girl is going through is : Louder than Words by Jenny McCarthy. 
I'm sure each childs condition is different but have you ever thought about adding supplements, Vit B-12, probiotic, Fisl oil, Whole food vitamins etc. Our American Food industry is loaded with chemically altered stuff which also does play a major role in these so called for neurological disorders in kids thesedays.

1768,Apraxia vs. speech delay,"
        Sorry for the delayed reply but apraxia, though it has been identified in children with autism, is its own condition.  Apraxia is defined as the inability to perform previously-learned tasks or movements even though your muscles and senses work properly. It is a neurological disorder.  More sound information on apraxia can be found at the following link:
http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003203.htm
I suggest that you seek a thorough developmental assessment by a specialist in developmental disorder.  Intervention is heavily influenced by the type of condition the child presents with and apraxia can be associated with a number of other conditions, like seizures.  If your child has apraxia they should also receive an extensive medical work-up potentially including some of the test referenced through the aforementioned link.
More information on developmental screening can be found at the following Center for Disease Control site:

1769,Apraxia vs. speech delay,"
        My son, now 13 years-old, has dyspraxia. The first signs were lack of speech. He was three years old and would only make nonsensical words. I was told by doctors that there was nothing wrong. To say the least, they were wrong.

After an evaluation, I was able to put him in speech therapy through the school district. It was a miracle. He slowly started with words, then sentences etc. He also received speech therapy through our medical insurance. I only wished that I had done it sooner.

The best help is therapy. Your medical insurance should be able to help.

The most important thing is to start as soon as possible.

1772,Help!!!!!!,"
        I appreciate your frustration in identifying a diagnosis for your son. However, independent of his diagnosis, you will want to be sure that you get some help with his problem behavior. I strongly recommend that you seek the assistance of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers. A Board Certified Behavior Analyst would be able to conduct or oversee an assessment to determine why your son is displaying this problematic behavior. An intervention based on this type of assessment is very likely to reduce you son’s problematic behavior, and the development of an intervention does not rely on diagnosis.

        First of all I would check with the school system to see why a teacher thought that was funny.  Is there a guidance counselor at your school?  If so, I would check in with them to see if they can recommend treatment/therapy.  I assume you have a developmental pediatrician since you have a diagnosis of autism; I would be in contact with that person to see your son again and evaluate if he needs to be seen by someone to provide counseling or someone to provide behavior therapy.  In other words given the diagnosis and clear social problems I would not hesitate to get professional help.

1779,Is this Autism???,"
        I am not sure what the diagnosis is but I would recommend an evaluation by a team of professionals at a local university or hospital to identify or rule out developmental issues.  The advantage is that children with defiticts profit most from early diagnosis and intervention.  And if there is nothing wrong, then it is great to rule out problems.  the diagnosticians should include a developmental pediatrician or a pediatric neurologist as well as PT/OTs and language specialists.

        I have a 4 year old autism spectrum girl.  She did not walk until 16 mo...and is behind in other ways.  It really sounds like your niece does have some issues that she should be seen for.  It could be mild autism spectrum, or a learning disorder, or ?? Sometimes parents are so traumatized by thinking that their kid could have autism or something  like it, they are in denial....we were like that and very angry when it was mentioned to us a long time ago.  Now, we talk about it openly.  My advice would be to mention a book or tv show that you have seen about autism spectrum and see if they want to talk about it.  Otherwise, she should be seeing a developmental pediatrician for help.  They say that age 0-5 are the best  years for treatments.  Hope you can talk openly to your sibling.

1781,FLAPPING ARMS,"
        Since you are concerned and the issue seems to be continuing rather than abating I would recommend that you have her evaluated by a developmental pediatrician or a pediatric neurologist to rule out any developmental issues.  If this is just an idiosyncratic behavior you can try to teach her an alternative and reinforce her for engaging in the alternative.  One strategy that might help is a technique called ""habit reversal"" which has been used successfully with some individuals with more serious tic disorders.  If you search the journal JABA (Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis) it has several publications on that treatment which is a form of self-monitoring.  You teach the individual to identify the behavior, teach an alternative and reinforce for engaging in the alternative.  On the other hand you could let this go a bit longer and see if peer pressure helps her modify it.

        If your son is havinag persistent behavior problems at school you need to seek help from the guidance counselors.  If they cannot provide specific behavioral programs to deal with the difficulties I recommend that you have the school system find a consultant who is experienced with behavior issues and is a certified behavior analyst.  You do not mention a diagnosis so I can't speak to that issue except to note that persistent behavior problems suggest a need to have a team evaluation by a local hospital or university to rule out developmental or psychiatric issues.

        My son just turned three years old.  He has been in O/T, S/T and Play Therapy for 1 1/2 years.  He is our 5th child and I knew when he was about 18 mos old that something was not quite right when the words he had learned he could no longer say.  He had also started having severe meltdowns, babbling, flapping his hands, echolalia, lining things up, obsessed with blinking lights, ceiling fans, excessive sensory issues, and the list goes on.  We had him enrolled in the infant toddler program to receive services, and we had to become strong advocates for him because alot of times we would hear, ""Oh, he has excellent eye contact, he is so smart, he smiles, etc. (ad nauseam).""  He has now graduated from that program but still receives his therapy services at the clinic, and is eligible for services one day a week through the school district.  He has an appt scheduled for next month with a developmental pediatrician.  He has made great strides, but now new things are developing, such as aggressive and other inappropriate social behaviors, hyperactivity, etc.  I have been advised that even with a ""diagnosis"" for autism of any sort, his treatment would probably remain the same.  It has been a challenge for our entire family, but the results have been amazing nonetheless.  With or without a diagnosis, your son should still be referred for some sort of therapy for his symptoms, and be able to start.  It will help him tremendously.  Search all of your resources, and remember that his parents are his strongest advocates.  Stay encouraged.

        In general, when a child has a diagnosis of autism and is presenting challenging behavior I would recommend looking for specialized clinical help. Specifically, I would suggest finding a clinician who has worked with children on the spectrum and who has certification in Behavior Analysis (BCBA). You can find people in your area of the country who are certified by going to the following website link http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html  and type in your state. 

As for your daughter, the behaviors you describe all fall in line with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. The challenging behaviors, including tantrums and resistant to changes in routines are very common in children with autism. An experienced clinician can evaluate the situation by conducting a functional analysis and develop a treatment program to help reduce the rate of challenging behavior. Another important part of your interventions with your daughter will involve identifying a variety of preferred reinforcers that can be used to increase appropriate behavior. Children with autism as young as your daughter do not present bi-polar profiles. Get good clinical help and you will find that these challenging behaviors diminish.

        Hello Dr. Macdonald,
Thank you very much for  your reply.  I looked on the website and there are no BCBA doctors near us.  But, about 100 miles away there are about a half dozen, so we will try one of them.  THANKS!

So, we have one more question. The day after I posted this about her very challenging behavior, she started acting happier.  We have had about 5 days now of excellent behavior.  She is talking, listening, playing,  having fun, and just being almost a typical kid.  We have actually had outings without much screaming.  She still throws tantrums over things but it is a tolerable amount and they only last a minute. Maybe like a typical 4 year old almost.  It is like we can talk some sense to her right now.  The thing is, she cycles like this.  When we are in a bad cycle no amount of any reinforcing, sticker charts, etc does anything for her.  It is like she is just totally out of it, and screaming most of the time.  Then, it changes and she is great for a while.  This is one reason we thought maybe bi-polar?   And, the fact that a clinician that was at our house and witnessed soem of the behavior said her anger was extreme, and it could be bi-polar.  But, then we have these wonderful times like right now.  Of course, we look for anything that caused the good times, or the bad cycle and there is nothing we can think of.  recently, we started Super Nu vitamins and we are hoping they are helping.  At least that would give us some control over something and be able to help her.  However, we know logically that the bad cycle is probably coming again and we should not get our hopes up.

thanks for listening...

        Hi!
I just read your information on your daughter and I can def. relate. My son, 4 1/2, has many of the same things that your daughter has and like her they go in waves. He screams, hits, bites, scratches, mostly his older brother almost daily and gets upset over the smallest things. We have been to a psychologist and a psychiatrist who both say he is ADHD and PDD but I'm wondering if there is more. When he is upset he pushes on his fingers and walks on his toes and his feet turn on his ankles. His tantrums can sometimes lasts for 1 - 2 hours if he is very upset and he destroys items when he is in a tantrum. He repeats words sometimes, this is not always, but when he does it lasts for around a month or so and he throws the same word, or sometimes phrases, into a sentence that doesn't make sense. He also talked at a very young age and has done numerous things that just don't go along with his diagnosis. We are very confused. He is on medicine that seems to help with the ADHD but he has never caused a problem at school, it is when he is home that it is a nightmare. If he can't have a certain food, which he chooses for dinner he throws a tantrum. If we won't watch what he wants on TV, a tantrum. I know we are doing everything we can by seeing the Doctors but I still feel that there is more. We have applied to get help in our home, still waiting on an answer, but we feel that we our out of control. One of my biggest fears is we have a younger boy, 2, who is watching these fits and learning from him. I don't believe he has ADHD or PDD, but he learns from seeing his brother. I also have been looking for support groups to go to because we really need other parents to talk with to just get some of the stress out. I can't seem to find any in my area. Any suggestions would be helpful.
Thank you for posting and for listening to me!

Guanfacine (brand name Tenex) has been used as treatment for hyperactivity, impulsivity, anxiety, irritability, temper tantrums, and tics.  It is sometimes used together with a stimulant medication for ADHD.  Improvement is not typically seen for 2 weeks following the initiation of the medication and the full effects may not be apparent for two to four months.  Daytime sleepiness and fatigue are common side effects, so your describing him as being like a “zombie” is not surprising.  Any observed side effects should be reported to your doctor should be taking these into account in determining if this is the right medication or the right dose for your son.  As always, you should be comfortable with the doctor that is prescribing the medication and the doctor should explain to you the long-term plan regarding evaluation of the benefits and limitations of the medication.  If you aren’t on board with decisions being made or feel that they aren’t being explained to you sufficiently make sure you tell your doctor and/or seek a second opinion.

Below, I’ve included the text answering a different posted question regarding treatment of hyperactivity. 

The hyperactivity that you are noticing, while not part of the criteria for diagnosis, at least in my experience is not uncommon in individuals diagnosed with PDD-NOS.  Research has shown behavioral interventions alone (Coles et al., 2005; DuPaul, Guevremont, & Russell, 1992; Fabiano & Pelham, 2003) and behavioral interventions in conjunction with medication (Jensen et al., 2001; Miranda, Jarque, & Tarraga, 2006; Pelham et al., 2005) to be effective in treatment of hyperactivity.  Behavioral interventions have frequently involved identifying potent sources of reinforcement and arranging them contingent upon things like compliance with directives, sitting in seat during work times, and the absence of problem behavior.  These types of intervention often work best if the schedule of reinforcement is initially quite dense and then faded over time.  For example, one way of determining a reinforcer for your child might be to give him free access to his toys, videos, music, and some snacks and paying attention to what he spends his time interacting with.  If he happens to particularly enjoy a particular video, a work space might be arranged with a video player.  Initially, he might earn one minute of video for each 30 seconds that he spends in his chair being compliant.  The amount of time that is required of him would then be slowly increased as he becomes successful given his current criteria.  These procedures are sometimes used in conjunction with a token system, for example, he might earn one token for every 10 seconds of in-seat compliance and following the delivery of 3 tokens the video becomes available.  This also allows for fairly easy fading (e.g., first he needs 3 tokens, then 4, then 5, etc…).  This type of intervention is commonly initially put into place for only a short time each day and then the amount of time gradually increased.  I would recommend that you attempt to find a behavior analyst in your area that has worked with individuals with characteristics similar to your son’s previously (a directory of certified behavior analysts can be found at www.bcba.com).  Behavioral interventions for hyperactivity can be successful, but they should be overseen by someone who has experience in implementing them.

1801,dezastor dressing ,"
        It makes sense to try to take your child’s preference for clothes (e.g., color, style fit) into consideration to a certain extent. I do recommend allowing your child some input into the clothes you purchase. In addition, you may provide choices each morning before dressing. But, I strongly recommend that you limit options (e.g., between two shirts) and limit decision time (e.g., 1 min to choose, or mommy decides). Given the long duration of this problem, it seems unlikely that the fit of the clothes is really the problem. If it takes 1 ½ hours to complete the dressing routine, it is likely that the problem is persisting because of the attention that she receives during the process of dressing or because procrastinating allows her to delay whatever event comes after dressing (perhaps a transition to school). 

If your daughter is capable of dressing herself, I recommend placing her clothes neatly on her bed so that she can easily find each piece. Be sure to open any difficult fasteners (e.g., buttons, zippers) to make it easier for her to dress herself independently. Set a timer to allow a reasonable amount (e.g., 5 min) of time for dressing. I recommend that you arrange some type of reward if she is dressed within the allotted time period. In some family routines, there are naturally occurring rewards for cooperation. For example, a child might have time to watch a few minutes of a favorite television program or eat a special breakfast if she is dressed quickly. Take advantage of these naturally occurring rewards if you can. Otherwise, pick something that she requests frequently and/or seems to enjoy (e.g., a favorite toy, a small snack), but to which she has limited access. If she does not dress herself in the allotted time period, simply help her to complete dressing. Use the minimal amount of assistance necessary for your daughter to be fully dressed. Do not engage in conversation about her clothes or her failure to dress herself. When she is dressed, simply move on to the next event in the routine, but avoid allowing access to any favorite activities immediately after dressing.

If your daughter is not independent with dressing, a slightly different approach will be needed. With each step in dressing (e.g., putting on a sock), give your child a brief period of time (e.g., 3-5 seconds) to complete the step independently, then provide the type of assistance your child needs to complete the step (e.g., stretch the sock open so that she can slip her foot in, guide her arm gently into her sleeve). Again, do not engage in conversation about her clothes or comment about any uncooperative behavior that she displays. Follow through with dressing until it is complete. Make positive statements when she is cooperating. With this approach dressing should be completed in approximately 5 min.

        I am not surprised to hear that your son, with a diagnosis of PDD-NOS engages in the types of stereotyped or ritualistic behavior that can also be observed in individuals diagnosed with OCD.  In fact, this type of behavior is also part of the DSM IV criteria for autism spectrum disorders.  The hyperactivity that you are noticing, while not part of the criteria for diagnosis, at least in my experience is not uncommon in individuals diagnosed with PDD-NOS.  Research has shown behavioral interventions alone (Coles et al., 2005; DuPaul, Guevremont, & Russell, 1992; Fabiano & Pelham, 2003) and behavioral interventions in conjunction with medication (Jensen et al., 2001; Miranda, Jarque, & Tarraga, 2006; Pelham et al., 2005) to be effective in treatment of hyperactivity.  Behavioral interventions have frequently involved identifying potent sources of reinforcement and arranging them contingent upon things like compliance with directives, sitting in seat during work times, and the absence of problem behavior.  These types of intervention often work best if the schedule of reinforcement is initially quite dense and then faded over time.  For example, one way of determining a reinforcer for your child might be to give him free access to his toys, videos, music, and some snacks and paying attention to what he spends his time interacting with.  If he happens to particularly enjoy a particular video, a work space might be arranged with a video player.  Initially, he might earn one minute of video for each 30 seconds that he spends in his chair being compliant.  The amount of time that is required of him would then be slowly increased as he becomes successful given his current criteria.  These procedures are sometimes used in conjunction with a token system, for example, he might earn one token for every 10 seconds of in-seat compliance and following the delivery of 3 tokens the video becomes available.  This also allows for fairly easy fading (e.g., first he needs 3 tokens, then 4, then 5, etc…).  This type of intervention is commonly initially put into place for only a short time each day and then the amount of time gradually increased.  I would recommend that you attempt to find a behavior analyst in your area that has worked with individuals with characteristics similar to your son’s previously (a directory of certified behavior analysts can be found at www.bcba.com).  Behavioral interventions for hyperactivity can be successful, but they should be overseen by someone who has experience in implementing them.

1804,refocusing behavior,"
        In most cases, we find that aggressive behavior displayed by children with autism and other developmental disabilities is a form of communication. Because aggressive behavior is often successful in producing some reaction from adults and peers, children learn that aggressive behavior may be an effective way to indicate that they want or need attention, a break from what is going on around them (e.g., challenging academics, too much social stimulation or noise), or a favorite toy or snack. One well researched and often very effective strategy is to attempt to teach the child an alternative way to communicate their wants and needs appropriately. Therefore, a first step would be to ensure that your child can communicate when she wants attention, a break, or a favorite toy or snack. It is important for teachers and caregivers to agree to a specific form of communication that is appropriate to your daughter’s skill level and to attempt to honor her requests as immediately and frequently as possible. Otherwise, she may find that aggression is a more efficient form of communication. At first, it would be best to give frequent reminders (before aggression occurs) for your child to communicate appropriately. Finally, teachers and caregivers (and peers to the extent possible) should attempt to respond as neutrally as possible to the aggression. When aggression occurs (a) avoid excessive attention for aggression, (b) attempt to continue ongoing interactions (e.g., academics), and (c) avoid presenting favorite toys or snacks immediately following aggression. If this approach is implemented very consistently, I would expect to see some improvement within about 2 weeks, but it is important to record your child’s behavior carefully so that you can have an accurate assessment of the effects of any intervention. A Board Certified Behavior Analyst should oversee the implementation of this type of strategy. Please visit the website of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (http://www.bacb.com/) where you will find a directory of service providers.

The most basic social and communication skills include: eye contact, requesting, following directions and establishing some form of symbolic language (spoken words or picture communication system).

1810,Autism Diagnosis Waiting,"
        You certainly have many questions and I hope that you get some sound guidance quickly from the specialist screening your daughter for autism.  First and foremost, there is sound evidence about effective intervention for autism.  The only empirically-validated, effective intervention is teaching the child diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder the skills they need to function independently using the tools of applied behavior analysis. Early intensive behavioral intervention has been shown to produce marked changes in the skill deficits and problem behavior associated with autism.  Some children have been noted to lose their diagnosis following a period of individualized instruction.

In terms of dietary interventions, there is no sound emprical evidence that they are effective.  Dietary interventions for developmental and learning disabilities have been controversial for decades.  When a child presents with a metabolic disorder, it often follows that diet may be a critically important variable.  Certain metabolic disorders, like phenylketonuria, are effectively managed by diet.  Feingold (1975) first proposed that eliminating certain substances like preservatives would result in a child with attentional problems, becoming more focused and less hyperactive.  These claims did not turn out to be valid for 95% of the children treated with diet (NIH, 1996) and those who were helped tended to have identifiable food allergies.  Evidence suggests that ADHD is a neurological condition but it is a complex disorder with little solid information about its cause.  We do know that ADHD is unlikely to be caused by food allergies, excessive sugar intake, or other variables that do not affect an individual’s neurological make-up (NIH, 1996).  
Unless a child has a food allergy/intolerance or metabolic condition it is unlikely that dietary changes will affect their disability.  Some have said that vaccines damage the gut and leads to gut problems, however, Taylor and his colleagues (2002) in a study with nearly 500 children with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) found no relation between the MMR and bowel problems. Looking specifically at gut problems in persons with autism, Black, Kaye and Jick (2002) found that children with ASD were no more likely to have an irritable bowel-like gastrointestinal problem than their age-matched peers. These studies strongly indicate that there is no link between the gut and autism.  
Although we are hopeful that empirically validated biological interventions can be developed to treat or perhaps prevent ASDs, it is more likely that the nature of successful therapy will not target the gastrointestinal system.
Nonetheless, it is still unknown whether a dietary intervention could treat autism.  Currently, the most popular diet promoted as a cure for autism involves restricting casein and gluten from the child’s diet.  The unfounded assumption behind recommending that casein and gluten be restricted is that the processing of these substances causes many of the symptoms of autism.  
Both typically developing children and children with ASDs can have food allergies.  It is also the case that children are more likely to have food allergies than adults.  So food allergies are clearly an appropriate concern.  In fact, at times they can involve severe reactions that are life threatening.  Food allergies occur because the body develops antibodies specific to the allergen in the offending food.  The next time that this substance is ingested, the antibodies then trigger the release of histamine and an allergic reaction occurs.  Most children with a significant food allergy appear sickly.  They have symptoms that are typical of an allergic reaction, may vomit frequently, and often have abnormal bowel movements.  Shortly after the food the child has an allergy to is ingested, symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, tingling/swelling in the mouth area, difficulty breathing, pronounced rashes especially on the face or torso) appear.  Most children outgrow their allergies although it is thought that allergies to nuts (and peanuts), fish, and shellfish are likely life-long allergies.  
If a child has a documented food allergy then removing the allergen(s) from the child’s diet is one necessary component of resolving the problem.  However, determining that the child has a food allergy is a critical first step.  If a child is suspected of having an allergy because of symptoms, then there are two tests commonly accepted as valid means of diagnosing food allergy.  These are the skin ***** and RAST (radioallergosorbent) tests.  So long as the allergic reaction is not severe, these tests can then combined with information gathered by alternately exposing or restricting access to the suspected allergen and determining whether symptoms respectively appear and dissipate to confirm test results.  For the child with a food allergy, the benefit of removing the allergen will be apparent in that the overt symptoms caused by ingestion of the offending substance will dissipate but if the child has a disability as well, the disability will persist.  The child who is no longer in discomfort will also likely be more receptive to instruction and have a more positive affect.
So, why not restrict access to casein and gluten just to make sure you are doing everything you can for your child?  First, the lack of scientific evidence that casein and gluten cause autism is concerning.  This combined with the evidence that gastrointestinal (GI) difficulties and autism are not linked, should cause you to question the plausibility of dietary intervention for this disorder.  Then again, most significant in my mind is the fact that children with ASD are prone to selective eating (Ahearn et al., 2001).   During our study of the eating habits of children with an ASD, my colleagues and I provided children with a variety of foods across six meals spread out over at least two weeks.  Over half of the children we observed presented with some form of selective eating.  Though we saw selectivity for various food groups, the food group that our selective eaters were most likely to prefer was starch.  Gluten is a constituent of many starches and restricting access to this substance can lead to eliminating the only foods that a child regularly eats.  
The course of action that I have followed as a clinician treating selective eating has been to attempt to expand the variety of foods a child eats.  I’ve worked with children who ate only one food and would not eat unless that food was prepared in a specific manner (e.g., macaroni and cheese made with whole milk and butter served straight out of the pan).  Going from such selective acceptance of food to eating other foods often takes quite a long time.  The only situations in which I would recommend restricting access to food would be if the child had a documented food allergy or excessively consumed food.  Several parents have reported to me that they have tried the casein/gluten-free diet and their child would not eat any of the foods presented to them.  To be fair, I’ve also had a number of parents swear to me that this diet was very helpful but none of them answered yes when I asked them if the diet cured their child of autism.  It is my opinion that children with an ASD will not benefit from dietary restrictions of any kind unless they also have a food allergy or intolerance.  Furthermore, children who are selective eaters are likely to become more selective and may stop eating when their diet is radically restricted.   Because children with ASDs are prone to selective eating it is probably a good idea to attempt to expand their diets rather than restrict them.

1812,Asymmetrical ventricles,"
        This is actually a very complicated matter.  For starters, it is likely that the ventricular asymmetry and Asperger's have a common origin.  Asperger's is a milder form of the family of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).  ASDs are thought to have a strong genetic origin and it is likely that your son's asymmetry is similarly genetic in origin.  Current neurological evidence suggests that ASDs are the product of abnormal brain growth regulation.  

In a somewhat recent review of studies of brain development in children with autism, Eric Courchesne (2004) describes two converging lines of research that have revealed a good deal of information about abnormal brain growth related to this disorder. Head circumference is accepted as a sound measure of brain volume. Several studies have found that children with autism tend to have normal or slightly smaller than typical head circumference at birth (e.g., Courchesne et al., 2003). However, from 6-14 months of age head circumference increases rapidly and excessively in children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with very little growth from then through the 28th month. So it is assumed that brain growth occurs earlier and rapidly in children with an ASD, but also slows or shuts down too early. Head circumference changes more gradually and is more evenly distributed across the first two years of life in typically developing children.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations have confirmed and extended the results obtained by measuring head circumference. For example, Sparks and colleagues (2002) found that the brain volume of children with an ASD at 3-4 years of age was significantly larger when compared to typically developing children. This study also noted that the size of specific regions of the brain, the cerebrum, cerebellum, and amygdala, were all larger for children with an ASD than in typically developing children. Other regions of the brain, such as the occipital lobes, however, have been found to be similar in the typically developing and ASD populations, indicating that the brain is not uniformly enlarged (Carper et al., 2002). Courchesne (2004) and others speculate that this neurodevelopmental abnormality contributes to many of the behavioral manifestations of autism spectrum disorders. One of these regions, the cerebellum, is thought to be involved in perception, language, and emotion. Abnormal development in the cerebellum likely underlies difficulties observed in these areas in persons with autism. Clearly much more work is to be done to confirm and extend these results, but Courchesne is hopeful that these lines of research will help to clarify the prenatal factors that lead to this abnormal brain growth regulation in children with ASDs.

Additionally, there are a number of developmental issues that involve asymmetric development that are associated with a greater likelihood of ASDs.  One of these is oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum or OAV.  Another disorder that is associated with autism and can involve the ventricles is tuberous sclerosis.  More information on this disorder can be found through MedlinePlus at the link below:

        I'll work on answering as much of this question as I can.  First and foremost, there is no cure for autism.  The term cure is controversial even when a person previously diagnosed with autism loses that diagnosis later in life.  Many prefer the term recovery. The only empirically-validated, effective intervention is teaching the child diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder the skills they need to function independently using the tools of applied behavior analysis. Early intensive behavioral intervention has been shown to produce marked changes in the skill deficits and problem behavior associated with autism.  Some children have been noted to lose their diagnosis following a period of individualized instruction.

The second question is a bit hard to understand but I'll assume you are referring to secretin injection.  Secretin is a hormone that exists naturally in the body and is involved in gastrointestinal functioning. It was reported in a medical journal that a single intravenous injection of secretin had resulted in substantial improvements in language and behavioral difficulties for three children diagnosed with autism. However, this was not a controlled study and the means of determining whether the injection had an effect was questionable. Strong scientific evidence has been growing that secretin has no clinically meaningful impact.

Several recent studies have confirmed secretin’s failure to improve skill performance or behavior problems and have addressed some of the criticisms of earlier investigations. One criticism of several controlled studies has been that the children injected with secretin have not had gastrointestinal problems. A study, conducted by scientists from Harvard University’s Medical School and the University of California, looked at children diagnosed with autism who were also reported to have gastrointestinal difficulties (Lightdale et al., 2001). They found that secretin produced no increases in language or other social skills and no decreases in problem behavior.

Another criticism has been that some children require multiple injections of secretin to show beneficial effects. A study by Roberts and colleagues (2001) investigated the effects of repeated injections of secretin relative to injections of a placebo with 64 children diagnosed with autism. They found no evidence that secretin was an effective treatment. They noted that both groups improved in receptive and expressive communication but that these gains “were likely attributable to familiarity with the testing situation, maturation, and/or ongoing behavioral interventions.” The study also found that the secretin injection was associated with: a rash for one child; a fever, rapid heartbeat, and vomiting for another child; an increase in irritability in 3 children; and, a flushing of the skin for 21% of the children who were injected with secretin.
