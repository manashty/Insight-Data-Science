2,Possible autism signs ?,"
Hi, welcome to the ehealth forum and I am glad to help you.
It is very difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the information that you have given about your 4 year old nephew but I will still hint at the possibilities.
The first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others, yelling, calling others  stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days. As children age, oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school.
The other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation, delay in development of spoken language(as you said that his speech is hard to understand),preoccupation with stereotyped interest(as in going to bathroom on the porch).
The other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speech(before he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated),aggressive behaviour, disruptive behaviour, alternating moods inappropriate to environment, school problems etc. The only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence. So it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life. 
All above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person. You must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology.
Hope this helps. Take care.

3,Autism? i think he is on point for 4 yrs old.,"
My spn is 4 years old due to go to full time school reception in January 2012. His teacher along with a SENCO teacher said to me that they feel that he may have autism. The reason they gave were he does not always look at them when they are talking to him, he may do group work for 10 minutes then he is not interested and gets distracted by things around him. And he cannot ride a bike. Firstly i have not taught him to ride a bike so hence why he cannot and he has not taught himself. They say he can read,knows colours, shapes,alphabet,numbers, all the names of the children in his class,if they put something up they think he cannot read he can.He doesn't hold his pen properly.He can hold conversations with children and adults,i potty trained him in a month aug 2010, he asked for things says please and thank you.Gives me direct eye contact when i talk to him or anyone family based. Only when he is excited he flaps his hands.At 4 i think he is on point for his age. what do u think

4,Autism? i think he is on point for 4 yrs old.,"
Hi, welcome to the ehealth forum and I am glad to help you.
You seem concerned by the possibility of autism in your 4 year old son.
Autism includes a broad spectrum of symptoms. Therefore, a single, brief evaluation cannot predict a child's true abilities. Ideally, a team of different specialists will evaluate the child. They might evaluate:communication,language,motor skills,speech,success at school,thinking abilities
Because there is no biological test for autism, the diagnosis will often be based on very specific criteria from a book called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV.
Autism can be associated with other disorders that affect the brain, such as:Fragile X syndrome,Mental retardation,Tuberous sclerosis
You must consult an appropriate medical facility where Autism kids are evaluated and treated as the same is not possible online.
Hope this helps. Take care.

5,Symptoms of autism,"
My son is now nineteen months old and doesnt say any words at all.  He jabbers a lot but you can't understand any of it.  He seems very normal otherwise. He plays and laughs and smiles. I've read things about how autistic children don't hold eye contact. He can and does. We have a seven year old son as well and I don't remember it taking this long for him to talk. Should I  be concerned that he may be autistic? I'm a nervous wreck over this.

6,Symptoms of autism,"
Autism is a medical condition in which there are problems with communication and social interaction.  This is a rather serious condition to be diagnosed without a complex and complete examination.  The child might lack eye contact, as you mentioned.  
The babbling in these children might be accompanied with unusual gestures, repeating othersâ words, whereas the words are less frequently associated with appropriate gestures.  Repetitive behaviour might be one of the symptoms that are most easy to recognize.  It might include: compulsive behaviour, ritualistic behaviour, stereotypy, or even self-injury.
As for the slow improvement of the speech, please consider that many children just need more time to talk and to be understood.  Different conditions might be causing this situation.  Sometimes the child might need help from a specialist for speech and language therapy, whom you are advised to visit.  
S/he might be able to detect if there are any physiological problems with the speech-related organs (the tongue, the palate, the throat) or the child simply needs more time to develop the speech.
To exclude autism you might want to take your child to a neuropsychologist pediatrician.  Until than, please keep in mind that there are many children at the age of 19 months whose speech is not fluent enough to be understood clearly.

7,Autism Recovery Success Story,"
My daughter was diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder at 20 months old.  Since that day I have been on a frantic search for help.  I have tried everything that I thought was harmless (GFCF diet, various therapy approaches, DAN doctors and homeopathic medicine).  It wasn't until I stumbled upon macrobiotics that I saw dramatic and relatively rapid improvements in my daughter's behavior.  It was a time demanding process, cooking, washing dishes, buying ingredients, not to mention training my child to eat this new food.  All this was challenging and seemed impossible at first.  It only took 2 weeks of persistent and patient feeding ""training"" to get her to eat EVERYTHING on her diet.  Quite remarkably two weeks after she was eating her diet I started seeing improvements.  I still remember the moment when she first looked at me.  It occurred quite naturally and without her need of anything from me.  She kept her eyes on me for what seemed like an eternity.  Earlier that same day she was playing in our neighbor's backyard and looked back to see if I was watching her as she was playing on their playground.  I will never forget those moments.  From there on things just started happening and while I can't quite recall the timeline, soon she had joint attention, was responding to praise, and at one point was so needy of my attention would turn my head towards her and tell me ""Look at my eyes"" when she wanted me to watch/listen to her.  
My daughter is now six.  She can't be picked out of the crowd as anything but a happy, sweet, loving, interactive and friendly kid.  After her diagnosis in my wildest dreams I couldn't imagine that she would be doing so well.  I would highly recommend giving macrobiotics a try.  It is fairly inexpensive, and in my experience the results are unmatched to anything else we tried.  It does take time and patience especially in the beginning.  The possible outcome, however, is worth all that tremendous effort.   
I recently started a non-for profit organization, Macrobiotic Autism Treatment.  Our organization exists to improve the lives of other autistic children and their families.

8,Autism Recovery Success Story,"
I would like to ask you if you avoided chicken and egg for your daughter as the chi/ki is wrong in this case:
CHICKEN AND EGGS 
Chicken makes the body tight, hard, and inflexible, especially the muscles, bones, and nerves. The upper back tends to become round, the shoulder blades tighten and harden, and fat gathers in the throat and neck, causing possible thyroid problems. Stiffness in the extremities, especially swollen and painful joints, leads to arthritis as the fingers and toes begin to take on the clawlike qualities of poultry. Wobbly thin legs, excessive blinking, pointed nose, and tics, twitches, or other jerky motions frequently accompany long-term chicken eating. Mentally, eating chicken contributes to henpecking, obsession with details and trivia, and a small, fragmented view of life. 
Eggs are one of the most condensed foods eaten by humans and give extreme, contractive energy. Excessive egg intake creates hardness in the ovaries, prostate, pancreas, liver, and other vital organs, leading to cysts, tumors, and possible cancer. Energetically, people who eat a lot of eggs have a vibrational shell around them that makes it hard to communicate with others. Just as a baby chick breaks out of its shell, egg eating can lead to spontaneous eruptions and outbursts. Eggs give strong analytic and reasoning abilities, charging the left brain.

13,Absent-mindedness/forgetfulness/unable to retain information,"
After sustaining a head injury at the age of 5, it has been difficult for me to pay attention to others, remember anything, and I believe I have been absent-minded for the majority of my life. It's as if I am in a trance-like state, where nothing really exists in my mind. 
Even though I managed to get into a grammar school, I was always a remarkably poor student. I failed GCSE science and geography and my other grades were merely Cs. But I did 'accomplish' two terrible A Levels. 
At the age of 22 I attempted to kill myself because of feelings of hopelessness and inadequacy. 
Subsequent to the failed attempt to take my own life, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, depression and anxiety. 
However, three years later I was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, which somewhat explains why it is so difficult for me to relate to other people. 
I am trying to discern if there's something fundamentally wrong with my brain, or if my problems are related to autism and depression. I believe my frontal lobe may be damaged after the aforementioned accident that occurred when I was 5. I also suspect that I might have a form of inattentive ADHD.

15,Absent-mindedness/forgetfulness/unable to retain information,"
After looking at your situation I believe that I have lived through a similar experience and that I may be of some help. Allow me to share my personal experience with anxiety and depression. 
I used to associate depression or anxiety with people who were sad and cried all the time. I also thought depression was caused by a massive life trauma such as a loved one dying or job loss etc; I was wrong. I was quite confident in secondary school; I was academic, outgoing, with a big group of friends. As soon as I moved back home after my first college flop in DCU it all started to change. It's easy to think ""he's a young man, sure what would he be anxious or sad about?!"" - but age, gender, social background etc... make no difference when it comes to anxiety.
In early 2012 I noticed I was full of self-doubt, always looking for reassurance from others in all aspects of my life, unmotivated, highly anxious and generally miserable. Instead of talking about this I relied heavily on alcohol - as a young person, this is seen as relatively normal. Drinking is the a main past time for young people of our generation so I didn't see it as a major problem. But if anything, it fuelled my low moods and anxiousness. When I returned back to college, my mood picked up for a while but over the course of the next year or so it would deteriorate again
I went to the doctor almost fortnightly, not wanting to believe it was depression I wanted to check every other avenue - was it a hormonal imbalance, something wrong with my glands or pancreas, was it a bad side effect to the pill.. absolutely anything. I demanded endless blood tests but eventually I accepted the fact when told by my doctor. At the start of 2015 my depression reached its peak; I was irritable, mood swings like no tomorrow, my anxiety almost bordered paranoia at some stages. All I can describe it as is like the daily version of ""The Fear"" - like what most of us experience after a heavy nights drinking, however this ""fear"" would occur almost daily. I was nauseous, a sense of guilt (even when I'd done nothing wrong) and extremely paranoid. If a friend didn't text back I'd assume they were mad at me for some ridiculous reason - my head was an abundance of irrational thoughts, constantly.
 
From the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed, completely irrational thoughts would takeover my mind. Causing me to be emotionally and mentally drained. My sleep suffered - if I did sleep it would be broken. I felt the need to explain myself constantly to others and when I tried to do so it would make no sense whatsoever, worsening things for myself and getting myself even more worked up. I would over analyse every single situation I found myself in, to the most ridiculous lengths. My head felt ""addled"" and full, concentrating was hard and God forbid I had to study because that was impossible due to my level of procrastination. My part time work even suffered and I had no choice but to take time off. To be brutally honest I thought I was losing my mind, that is how overwhelming it was.
It is important to talk to people but you must be aware not all people will act as you would hope. Some people will never grasp what is going on inside your head and will label you as ""crazy"" and ""psycho,"" they will tell you it's all in your head and to essentially get over it, others will avoid the topic and isolate you until they think the problem has magically resolved itself - this however is a minority group, thankfully. The majority of the support system I had around me were amazing; some of them will never understand the importance they played in my coping - some of my friends would endure nonsensical phone calls with me wailing down the phone until I calmed down, others coming to my house while I just napped because I was so mentally exhausted and then of course the crazy irrational messages if my mind was in overdrive they would get from time to time.
 
My family were also very supportive; My Dad would notice I was upset and would only have to ask me what was up for me to let it all out to him while he simply listened and let me cry. My mother on the other hand would let me cry on the phone to her but then be on hand to give me solid advice on what to do. An understanding friend or family member is actually such an incredible help, people who suffer from anxiety or depression need non-judgemental support. You would be surprised at how much difference this would make, or if you are not a great person in these situations, even giving this person advice on where to turn such as counselling, suggesting they seek advice from their GP or speaking to their family in confidence. Judging an anxious person will only make them worse - the whole outlook of a person suffering from anxiety is the fear of judgement and feeling inadequate.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a ball of anxiety all the time, but it is always niggling in the back of my mind. I primarily wrote this piece because I honestly thought that I was the only one feeling this way - I thought I was going crazy... So my message to others is; more people suffer from this than you realise, believe me. There are many ways to combat this; I would recommend talking to your Doctor or a local counsellor. Certain things work for different people; if I'm stressed I will walk for ages while listening to music. Others have mindfulness techniques, meditation - there are many different coping mechanisms.
Worrying the odd time, or getting stressed in certain situations such as before a big match or job interview is perfectly okay and having the occasional bad day or week here or there is completely normal as well - but when you feel like you can't function or do normal day to day things because you're feeling particularly anxious or low that's when you should seek some help.
If this helps you I will be absolutely delighted. I have included a few useful resources for anyone who may need them as I personally myself have used and can say I am indeed feeling a lot better now.

18,Asperger's/Mild autism + Physical disability. Eligible for SSI?,"
SHORT VERSION:
I'm posting this in the hope of helping a good friend. Here's her basic information.
-23 years old.
-Aspberger's or mild autism.
-Small body size and very limited physical capability.
-Mental health issues including self harm.
-Never gainfully employed. Fired from simple, tips-only job, five hours, one night a week.
-Unable to concentrate on anything even vaguely tedious, no matter how simple.
-Destructively impatient and overly emotional. Prone to rages.
-Uninsured. (Pending due to ACA.)
-Facing poverty and homelessness.
I used the preliminary test (B.E.S.T.) on the SSA website to see if she might be eligible for SSI, and it found that she might be eligible. Does anyone have any experience with this?
FULL EXPLANATION:
A good friend of mine is somewhere on the shallow end of the autism scale. She's intelligent but has poor (and by poor, I mean virtually nonexistent) concentration for any task which she finds too ""disorganized"" or ""stupid."" She's impatient to the point where it stops her from performing simple tasks.
She was unable to complete the opening of a PayPal account to sell some handmade items she makes. She became frustrated and infuriated almost instantly upon seeing that the website had text she had to go through and was unable to figure out how to work the site, even though it's quite user friendly and she's very computer literate. I could not convince her to try to be patient and learn to use it. The volume of unengaging text rendered her completely nonfunctional at this task. She went into a rage-filled panic attack.
She also has some serious physical maladies. She's 23 years old, about 5""2', and weighs 80 pounds. She has been underweight all her life and it's nearly impossible for her to gain weight. She has renal glycosuria (she excretes sugar instead of retaining it) and may be having episodes of hypoglycemia. She's predictably unable to lift much weight and becomes exhausted easily. I've done volunteer work with her and she's nearly incapable of physical labor.
She may also have some pressing mental health issues and has engaged in self harm. (She has sharpened her fingernails to better scratch her own face.) She's emotionally unstable, becoming unreasonable and overly angry or sullen when she's upset, and she focuses on and magnifies small problems. She becomes angry, petulant, and rude when things do not go as she expects or plans, and she frequently alienates people. She's sometimes paranoid that people are judging, manipulating, or trying to harm her and may react to individuals as though they are actively doing so. She's known to fly into rages and, in spite of her small size, has managed to overturn and destroy things when she does. A few months ago she destroyed her iPhone when she threw it.
She is very creative and has a high I.Q., but she has never been gainfully employed and I seriously doubt her ability to do tasks such as paperwork. She has worked for tips as a point-and-click disc jockey in her uncle's club, using his music and equipment. This was five hours one night a week, but she fought with her uncle and was fired. She's capable of doing creative or engaging tasks with infinite patience but dissolves completely when faced with anything outside her realm of understanding.
She's currently living with her mother (who is chronically unemployed, alcoholic, and no help at all) and great-grandmother, who is the homeowner, 91, and declining. They will not inherit her home. My friend's options will be extremely limited when her great-grandmother dies.
I'm very seriously concerned that my friend will not be able to maintain employment. I'm doing this for her because, as near as I can tell, she won't/can't and no one else will help her. I want to help her apply for SSI so she'll have some kind of financial security.

20,Am I Autistic ?,"
Hi,
I'm a 18 year-old boy and I think I might be autistic. With language I seem to not have severe problems, in fact I learned to speak at an early age (9 months) and I learned reading Latin words by myself at 3 years old (my native language is arabic) ,I don't know how I did that and even my friends say I'm lying but I'm not, I can remember things that happened when I was 2 and 3 years old, I'm good at remembering things, As a child I used to hit my head on the wall for minutes when I get angry, My mom told me I was obsessed with seeing how things work (like cars or carnival's attractions) , I was really different from other kids and I hated so much interacting with people and I still do (I hate weddings, birthdays and all kinds of ceremonies). When I was a kid I was too emotional with my stuff and I thought they were alive and I felt distress when my mom threw something mine or when I had to replace my bed and desk. Also I started wondering about my existence and life in general since a very young age, I always was obsessed with computers since I was 4 and I became now obsessed with computer programming. I'm good at maths but not really good in languages. I have a few male friends but no girls, no girlfriend and I'm extremely shy with girls.
So,  could I be autistic ?

24,Autism in children during pregnancy,"
Do you have any actual proof of that? There was a time when people thought the MMR vaccine gave children autism and that was disproved.
If this was the case, more women would be refusing induction and there would be something on the news about it.
It doesn't seem fair going around saying this when pregnancy and labour is a worrying time for any woman. 
For the child to be of the autistic spectrum one or both parents would need to carry the gene. If this is the case whether the mother is induced or not she may still have a child that falls on the autistic spectrum.
My step son is on the autistic spectrum and if you were to meet him, you'd think he was a normal child. But he has certain traits that puts him in the spectrum. The Spectrum for autism is huge and ranges so much from mild to extreme.

Hi, my name is Tina and I have a 10 year old brother who was diagnosed with Autism. He has Autism because he got mercury poisoning on his brain from the themerisol in his vaccines. He also inheirited a mutate MTHFR gene from both his parents (my mom and step dad). He is non verbal, can not have a communication device because he was ""Steaming?"" off of it more than he was using it, he knows a little sign language (mainly uses signs for yes, and more) and we have always been able to know when he is upset or doesn't want something to be happening. He started getting really aggressive and trying to hit people and it just has been getting worse and worse. He doesn't want anyone to talk at all, not at all. He covers his ears a lot now and has a lot of melt downs (several a day) and hasn't been able to sleep at all really (maybe a few hours a night,at best) and when he does get to sleep it isn't really deep sleep and he's up several times a night headed to my mom and step dads room trying to hit them (he has been hitting very hard, not holding back or stopping at all). He's been diagnosed with everything under the sun in addition to his Autism (Bi Polar, Manic, Epilepsy, depression) and recently he completed a carbohydrate specific diet that completly clean out his intestines. He was taking mostly vitamin or natural supplements, with the exception of Zoloft liquid. He doesn't eat dairy, wheat, gluten, or dyes . We get special flour and recipes to maintain this diet. He drinks mostly carbonated mineral water (with flavor, but no sugars or dye)His exceptional quality is that he is a wiz at using anything electronic, computers being his specialty!! He can run a computer fowards and backwards, he always knows what steps produce what results and he can troubleshoot them really well. He remembers everything, he only has to see someone (just see, not be shown) how to do something, anything, ONE maybe TWO times before he knows how. He is wonderful and we all love him with all our hearts!! Recently he was also diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder. They have him taking Seraquil now and after he gets better sleep for a while they are going to put him on a mood stablizer. I would appriciate any thoughts on this topic, but more than anything, I would like any support you can offer my mother and step father who are under a huge amount of stress right now.

So never let go of hope because no matter how little something seems, it doesnt mean its not there and cant grow.  Have a good day and take care!

29,Benefits of Autism Schools to Support Your Child's Education,"
If your child has autism, schools that specialize in this condition can be extremely beneficial. The earlier this type of education begins, the more benefits your son or daughter will receive.
A Nurturing Environment
Autism schools are equipped to handle mental and social development issues associated with the condition. Teachers receive intensive training on how to work with students and help them with social interaction. In many cases, these children feel compelled to perform certain repetitive behaviors such as stacking items into towers or placing them in a straight line. Teachers know how to work with these behaviors and can help students organize their lives in the same manner they organize items such as toys.
Public education is based in large part on a student's ability to interact with others. However, since most autistic children lack this ability, they can often feel lost and discouraged. Many autism schools are set up in a way that lessons are broken up to aid individual learning while also allowing children remove themselves from a social setting before they become upset. In addition, children will not have to deal with the teasing and ridicule that is often associated with the traditional education model.
Playtime is another area where autism schools are substantially different from their traditional counterparts. These schools design assessments in a way to determine whether or not there are other developmental issues that need to be addressed. Their tests may be comprised of tasks such as arranging letters on a magnetic board or sorting blocks by color. These differ significantly from public education tests that require students to take written examinations to prove they've absorbed knowledge mandated by state or federal requirements. These type of tests can be yet another source of frustration for children born with the condition.
A Different Alternative
The mainstream option of autism can be incredibly difficult to bear for children who can't properly interact with their peers. It can be heartbreaking for a parent to see his or her child ostracized because their differences make it hard to fit in. These children may be labeled as ""difficult"" by their teachers and fall behind in class as a result. Anytime children with this condition have to deal with large groups or overly stimulating settings, they can have a very hard time.
Autism schools provide a healthy alternative that can help children thrive through programs tailored to their exact needs. Just as with any important decision, however, you have to choose carefully to make sure you find the facility that will be the best fit for your child. If you have any friends or family members who have gone this route, talk to them and see if they have any recommendations. Check the Internet for reviews of different facilities you're considering to see what others are saying. The more confident you are in your final choice, the more likely your child will have an extremely positive learning experience.

You can not determine if you have aspergers via an online test,(my partner has it and i work with an animal theraphy program in a school which holds many people with disorders)And aspergers is a FORM on austism. I might be only 24 but clearly your skills in research are lacking. Austism is measured on a spectrum, aspergers is a lessor form of austism being it affects the behaviour of people but not the physical tracts i.e looks  of people. Please seek help in seeing if you are a person who has aspergers by going to medical professionsal ( also just so its clear Albert einstein has aspergers!) austism doesn't mean someone is broken in anyway it just makes them different.

39,Symptoms of autism:,"
Autism is an umbrella term for a group of disorders that affect the nervous system and musculoskeletal growth of the human being. 
Autism is diagnosed in childhood, and the symptoms must be present before the patient reaches the age of three years until the diagnosis is made carefully. 
There are a wide range of symptoms that can indicate the presence of autism, including abnormal social development, difficulty in communicating, and other symptoms. 
Treatment focuses on reducing the deficit of the social and cognitive development of the child as much as possible through programs of education and socialization own. 
In some cases, the description of some drugs that aim to reduce symptoms.
Symptoms of autism: 
1. separation from others, the autistic child seems most remote or separate from the people around him, as he captures the social signals.
2. inability to predict the actions of others or understanding which creates difficulty in communication and empathy with others.
3. indifference to interact with those around him: children with autism often do not respond when their name is called, they do not show an interest in engaging in social games or other tradition.
4 - show physically aggressive behavior of their parents, siblings, or other children may seem when a child autistic inability to control his emotions and physical responses in situations alien to it. 
5 - delayed language development: before 3 years of age, and the vast majority of children begin to simulate the words of others before the age of 3 years, the child begins to Hermit not babble or talk until much later without the help of speech therapy. 
6 - autistic child tends to express visual or physical means, such as graphics and signals instead of linguistic communication. 
7 - individuals with autism are prone to somewhat repetitive behaviors. 
For example, the rearrangement of the same group of games or images more than once in the same way, or repeating the same word or phrase in a way that seems obsessive. 
8 - some autistic children may go to eat non-food substances such as dirt, clay and sometimes insects. 
9 - sensitivity to external stimuli is another sign of an early warning of autism. 
For example, it may become autistic individuals with severe allergies to certain sounds, lights and smells, or the bright lights with violent reactions such as broken externality or panic him.
Diagnosis of autism
Children diagnosed with autism are behavioral observation of doctors for the child's behavior .But recently been discovered a new way to diagnose the disease by testing DNA made a set of markers in the blood , making diagnosis faster and more efficient .It is believed that this test could help identify people at risk of autism before the onset of symptoms , thereby increasing cure rates .

40,Symptoms of autism:,"
There is no cure for autism and it is not a disease.
Autism is a lot more complicated than how you are making it out to be. They have sensitivities to certain things (sounds, smells, touch) rather than it being an allergy. An allergy and a sensitivity are TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS!
By calling Autism a disease, you are effectively alienating them more than they are already.

Autism is a complex disorder in the development of human beings. There are many causes of disease are given, but the specific cause is not yet fully understood.

48,autism - what is it?,"
I hope these information would help you to have a better understanding about autism.
Autism is known as a complex developmental disability. Experts believe that Autism presents itself during the first three years of a person's life. The condition is the result of a neurological disorder that has an effect on normal brain function, affecting development of the person's communication and social interaction skills.
People with autism have issues with non-verbal communication, a wide range of social interactions, and activities that include an element of play and/or banter.
The way in which a person with an ASD interacts with another individual is quite different compared to how the rest of the population behaves. If the symptoms are not severe, the person with ASD may seem socially clumsy, sometimes offensive in his/her comments, or out of synch with everyone else. If the symptoms are more severe, the person may seem not to be interested in other people at all.
t is common for relatives, friends and people who interact with someone with an ASD to comment that the ASD sufferer makes very little eye contact. However, as health care professionals, teachers and others are improving their ability to detect signs of autism at an earlier age than before, eye contact among people with autism is improving. In many cases, if the symptoms are not severe, the person can be taught that eye contact is important for most people and he/she will remember to look people in the eye.
A person with autism may often miss the cues we give each other when we want to catch somebody's attention. The person with ASD might not know that somebody is trying to talk to them. They may also be very interested in talking to a particular person or group of people, but does not have the same skills as others to become fully involved. To put it more simply, they lack the necessary playing and talking skills.
Empathy - Understanding and being aware of the feelings of others
A person with autism will find it much harder to understand the feelings of other people. His/her ability to instinctively empathize with others is much weaker than other people's. However, if they are frequently reminded of this, the ability to take other people's feelings into account improves tremendously. In some cases - as a result of frequent practice - empathy does improve, and some of it becomes natural rather than intellectual. Even so, empathy never comes as naturally for a person with autism as it does to others.
Having a conversation with a person with autism may feel very much like a one-way trip. The person with ASD might give the impression that he is talking at people, rather than with or to them. He may love a theme, and talk about it a lot. However, there will be much less exchanging of ideas, thoughts, and feelings than there might be in a conversation with a person who does not have autism.
Almost everybody on this planet prefers to talk about himself/herself more than other people; it is human nature. The person with autism will usually do so even more.
A number of children with an ASD do not like cuddling or being touched like other children do. It is wrong to say that all children with autism are like that. Many will hug a relative - usually the mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, teacher, and or sibling(s) - and enjoy it greatly. Often it is a question of practice and anticipating that physical contact is going to happen. For example, if a child suddenly tickles another child's feet, he will most likely giggle and become excited and happy. If that child were to tickle the feet of a child with autism, without that child anticipating the contact, the result might be completely different.
A person with autism usually finds sudden loud noises unpleasant and quite shocking. The same can happen with some smells and sudden changes in the intensity of lighting and ambient temperature. Many believe it is not so much the actual noise, smell or light, but rather the surprise, and not being able to prepare for it - similar to the response to surprising physical contact. If the person with autism knows something is going to happen, he can cope with it much better. Even knowing that something 'might' happen, and being reminded of it, helps a lot.
The higher the severity of the autism, the more affected are a person's speaking skills. Many children with an ASD do not speak at all. People with autism will often repeat words or phrases they hear - an event called echolalia.
The speech of a person with ASD may sound much more formal and woody, compared to other people's speech. Teenagers with Asperger's Syndrome can sometimes sound like young professors. Their intonation may sound flat.
A person with autism likes predictability. Routine is his/her best friend. Going through the motions again and again is very much part of his/her life. To others, these repetitive behaviors may seem like bizarre rites. The repetitive behavior could be a simple hop-skip-jump from one end of the room to the other, repeated again and again for one, five, or ten minutes - or even longer. Another could be drawing the same picture again and again, page after page.
How quickly a child with autism learns things can be unpredictable. They may learn something much faster than other children, such as how to read long words, only to forget them completely later on. They may learn how to do something the hard way before they learn how to do it the easy way.
It is not uncommon for people with autism to have tics. These are usually physical movements that can be jerky. Some tics can be quite complicated and can go on for a very long time. A number of people with autism are able to control when they happen, others are not. People with ASD who do have tics often say that they have to be expressed, otherwise the urge does not stop. For many, going through the tics is enjoyable, and they have a preferred spot where they do them - usually somewhere private and spacious. When parents first see these tics, especially the convoluted ones, they may experience shock and worry.

49,autism - what is it?,"
Autism is used to describe a spectrum of disorders affecting brain development. This disorder is characterised by weakened social interaction, impaired verbal or non verbal communication and indulgence in repetitive behaviour. Though all these signs and symptoms start appearing after 3 years of age, scientists believe that the cause of this condition is rooted in certain mutational changes and environmental stress occurred during early life.
Much like a machine our brain relies on internal network of nerve cells for transmitting information. Through these networks our brain regulates other body function ranging from social behaviour to movements. These neurons are dependent upon surrounding glial cells for proper insulation, nutrition and oxygen requirement. Scientists have discovered that children with autism exhibit defects in the glial cells. These faulty glial cells are responsible for weakening of neurons and thus impairing effective communication amongst them.
The advent of stem cells technology has shown a new avenue in Autism cure. Besides having the potential to stimulate normal functioning of glial cells, these Adult Cells also have the capability to trigger an environment facilitating repair of weakened neurons and thus promoting improved communication and behavioural skills.

hi my name is Dean im a 35 yr old man with 5 children and 2 of them are serverly autistic. I didn't think it was a genedic disease until my second child was diagnosed.
My question is do you think that I could have a slight case of autism myself? im different then 99% of people I no, but its never been recognised because I look, speak and appear to be normal.
When I was a kid I never  really spoke much but I could talk, I had a lot of friends and everyone thought I was just a quiet kid and everyone iv ever met has liked me coz they could tell me anything noing that I would never say nothing to anyone. but the thing is I would always be in my own little world.
I was about 20 yrs old when I started talking and opening up to people, I seem to over look everything and think about things far to much. all my life iv always run from my problems coz I cant deal with emotional stress. everything I do has to be perfect, I don't like to make mistakes, and if I do I panic about it n it just plays on my mind. iv got 100s of friends but don't socialise with any of them, I don't like crowds of people and when I am iv got to be were I can see everybody. I also have a few other obsessive disorders,
I have this front that everybody sees but I seem to hurt the people that im close to or that care about me.
This has been plaing on my mind for 10 yrs since my first child was diagnosed because in some ways I see myself in both of them and I realy don't no what to do or who I should contact for help, any advice at all would be muchly appreciated. thankyou

60,is it possible that my kids got autism from me?,"
While yes ASD is significantly related to gene's. The fact is there is a lot we don't understand about how it develops in individuals. For example, we know  that autism can develop even if there has been no history of autism in the family tree. However, we also know that, those with a family history of ASD can skip generations, we know that people with autism have a grater chance of passing on autism. The point I am making is the answer to such a question is still subject to debate as the finer details of how autism is developed on a genetic level is not fully established. Accordingly, it is pointless to worry about that subject. So let's deal with the things you can work with.
 If you can afford it a child psychologist is the best thing you can do. For two reasons a) It can confirm the diagnosis in the children and offer CBT b) it will give the knowledge and tools as to how to best parent your children as autism requires quite a bit more knowledge then one would expect. 
As towards yourself once again if you can afford it a psychologist might be able to help you with your own struggle. 
Now if a psychologist is out of the financial range. There are a plethora of books on parenting autistic children. Perhaps that is something you want start with instead of going to the child psychologist. The reason I suggested a child psychologist is because you can the ask psychologist questions whereas you can't do so with a book.  
Furthermore, while it may be a long shot contact your government mental health services and ask if there is any special program that you and or your children can be enrolled into.   
Best of luck.

Regarding your dilemma about yourself, if you suspect that you have autism you better consult a doctor for the assessment of your behavioral pattern.  The doctor will be the one to tell you.  Don't be so anxious because it only aggravates your burdens. Also, bring your two children with autism to child psychologist so the doctor can properly address the problem and your children can be rehabilitated.

i am 15 years old and was diagnosed with autism when i was around four. my mother noticed it because i never spoke to anyone and was very distant from my family , i did not make eye contact even with my mum, however now i have many friends and am known for being a bit wierd and sometimes anti social and my teachers know this and look past it and occasionally send me out to calm down as i am easily wound up and get aggresive , me and my mother have never really been bothered about it but lately i have been showing signs of autism wich she has not noticed before , since i was little i have lived in pubs because my mum had her own business in them as a manger so when i wanted to stay out of sight and not talk to people i would have to talk and communicate because it was hard for her to get someone to babysit me so i would have to sit behind the bar until it was time for bed so i would get people trying to talk to me fequently and my mum would give me loving pushes to try talk with them, so my question is that can it be grown out of because for a few years i seemed like a very normal child however i am quite smart now and can notice things about my behaviour and how i look at the world that make me very different from others and like ive said i am known for being the thinker and strive to learn new things especially in physics , some of my friends and even a girlfriend i had found it fascinating how i looked at things and thought about situations , but im not sure maybe im just a strange person but many people would not think me to be autistic however many others when i tell them think that thats the reason for my strange habits and behaviour.
any ideas ??? thanks

My 10 year old son has autism and I have studied it and been to many autism trainings. Technically, no. You are not going to grow out of being autistic. That being said, there is nothing wrong with it and nothing to be worried about, everyone is different and your quirks make you a special person. You have no doubt learned coping strategies to your every day dilemmas in life and can continue to due so more and more. We all adapt.  Social behavior is learned. It is just harder for people with autism. If it helps at all once you finish school being different is no longer such a big deal.  A lot of truly great people in history are said to be autistic.

I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome as a child, so I used to find any physical contact uncomfortable and hated mixing with people, but I've found as I've got older I've become less awkward and you probably wouldn't realise just from looking at me and the Doctors have told me that it is very likely that I will appear to have grown out of it, because over time I would learn social skills and become less distant  hope this helped

My name is Joseph. I have a daughter diagnosed with autism at the age of 2 and half years. Then only I heard about it. Me and my wife did a vast study on this topic from many sources and how to reverse autism. There are many causes pointed out for autism. Many studies point about the vaccinations causing autism. Some vaccinations like MMR have a preservative agent called Thimerosal containing Mercury which is suppose to be a deadliest poison in the world. Our body has the capability to excrete many toxins but in some unlucky kids it affect the brain cells. 
In our child's case it seems to be very genuine as she started showing some symptoms after the second dose of MMR. 
Now the option is to eliminate the toxins from her body which we tried various methods. The best option we found is to give her the best vital nutrients and detoxification capable products. As there hundreds of products in the market claiming results but with no actual results, selecting the best one was difficult. We managed to find a great product and she is on the products since past 10 months and the improvement is just amazing.

Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) develop at a different rate and don’t necessarily develop skills in the same order as typically developing children. Autism in children often results in delays in their physical development. It affects the lower brain which is responsible for the child’s balance and co-ordination. Children with autism spectrum disorder, communication development happens differently and more slowly. Children with ASD often are unable to use gestures - such as pointing to an object - to give meaning to their speech. Often, children with ASD, who can speak will say things that have no meaning or that seem out of context in conversations with others.

We never want to let the years pass by in weakness. Now, there are labels put to conditions for the convenience of others. But we are unique and so is our set of problems. Often we challenge ourselves unnecessarily believing that some social norm is ""the good"" and we HAVE to cut it or we are ""bad"" - at whatever age. Well, schooling, for one is more indoctrination than education and has been on a steep slide for decades! Maybe not ""fitting in"" is a blessing in many environments! I would strongly suggest finding work that does not go so directly against the grain causing more self-esteem issues. Try a less people-contact job or where social graces are not so precious! I always recommend www.dyslexia.com which deals with autism particularly. Contact them and tell them your story. They are the best and of a new ""age"" in this. We have to climb out of the past and see each others' gifts.

I was a complete skeptic regarding alternative treatments. I have studied Autism in my professional work and also have a son originally dx with Autism. I was so desperate to try anything. I began using fish oil shortly after my son was dx. In three months, he was talking so much more and he was beginning to display interest in reciprocal communication with his peers. He had only 10 - 15 words in his spoken vocabulary at age 2 years, 3 months. He rarely made eye contact and was not interested in any type of reciprocal communication. The leaps and bounds he made amazed the three professionals who dx him. He slowly got better. Now he is a very social little boy who has wonderful expressive language skills. He still seems to be on the spectrum but it's hardly noticeable unless you work with him. Lately I have been noticing that he is getting worse. He has also started to stutter. One week ago I started him on fish oil again and didn't tell my husband. He noticed today that my son hasn't been stuttering as much and some of his ""cognitive inflexibility"" features seem to be diminishing. I am really trying to analyze whether or not there is a placebo effect on my part working but I honestly don't think so. My husband noticed a difference and he didn't know I was giving my son anything. I will just continue to see what happens. 
I am not saying this is the answer but it seems to have really helped my son. I don't believe fish oil can hurt and it certainly has helped my son!!
I would google ""fish oil and autism,"" as there has been some research studies pertaining to this. I haven't had a chance to actually review these studies but it should be interesting

94,"test that identify such things as autism, memory prob.?","
Hi,
I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction as to whether there is a medical test that will identify such things as autism, memory problems, other brain related issue.  The reason I ask is that my son (10 years old) has the following conditions
He cannot remember things that happen two hours ago, two days ago or two months ago.
He is socially very behind in conversation, communication and other interaction with people.  Note his schoolwork is above average across the board and he excels in mathematics and is working about two years ahead of his age group.
If you ask him to do something & show him it, then he can do most things pretty well, but if he has to think of anything for himself he just hits a complete wall.
He is scared of any physical contact.
He has no passion for anything, no desire, no willpower and gives up very easily.
So I totally understand that before any medical tests should be taken he should speak to a doctor, child psychologist etc etc, so I'm not looking for advice of that nature.
I purely looking to see if it is possible for him to undergo some sort of test which will identify any underlying medical issues.  Obviously I'm happy to pay for this and it doesn't concern me how much the test would cost.
My question is purely, is there anything out there that identifies a wide range of potential medical issues, not necessarily restricted to the suggestions I gave in my opening paragraph.
Thanks in advance,
Sky

102,Hand Flapping While Daydreaming,"
Hello. I'm new in these forums.
I'd like to know if I should worry by the fact that I daydream a lot (which has me helped to achieve positive goals, but I believe it might be a problem too), and also that when I'm excited about the subject I'm daydreaming about, I've tendency to hand flapping.
I've seen at YouTube videos of children with autism who are flapping hands while watching TV, like if they were very excited about what they're watching or imagining.
I flap hands very similar to them, with the difference that I'm not a child, but a 30 yo.
Also, it's voluntary... hand flapping is like an optional resource I can use for enjoying some of my daydreaming more. But I can choose not to do it, although I've some sort of ""internal desire"" to do it. Because hand flapping is not ""normal behaviour"", I close in some room when I wish to do it.
I've checked the symptoms lists of several illnesses that are related to hand flapping, but I don't match any of the symptoms: just hand flapping and a lot of daydreaming.
My social skills are good. I didn't have any learning disability as a child. I always got great marks in my childhood at school.
So, I believe I don't match any of the symptoms of autism, except hand flapping.
I believe there's a genetic component in whatever this symptom means: My father closes his fists and rubs his eyes with his closed fists when he's very excited about what he's watching on TV (he doesn't daydream, though, as far as I know).
My father has not been diagnosed about this symptom either, as far as I know, and he has normal social skills too.
Thank you in advance for any suggestion!!

I have also been a lifelong hand flapper, though I don't do it as much as an adult, and like you, can control it. I do it while daydreaming or when I'm excited about something. I am not autistic. I also got good grades in school and am a fully functioning, independent adult (I'm 41 now). However, I am shyer, quieter, and more prone to anxiety than the average person. But unlike autistic or Aspergers people, I'm extremely perceptive of social cues--and everything--around me. 
So, to answer your question, no, I don't believe we're autistic. However, I wonder if there's a common gene that autistic and shy people share and one of the side effects of this gene is hand flapping.

My 19 year-old son presents very similarly to Zadie.  He's always been quite shy and flaps when excited, particularly during action-packed or suspenseful movies.  He reports that he daydreams, imagining himself the good guy or the bad guy in the plot.  In addition to flapping, he kind of stiffens up, leans his head upward with eyes closed, and makes a funny face while nodding quickly back and forth.  The flapping can be quite vigorous.  Also, usually at night, he occasionally jumps high up and down involuntarily while flapping.  Among other unique characteristics, he hums involuntarily while eating, in a low gutteral sound, as if he were achy and sick.  He also has early satiety, constant anxiety, low muscle tone, and can be impulsive.

I too have a 10 yr old daughter who does this very often while in class, reading and watching TV - It's mostly when she is excited but she curls her hands in, flaps them inward and at times she cocks her head sideways and moves her head a little.  She has told me she pretends she is part of the story.  She can also control this and seems to be in a trance when she is in this mode.  Once you call her name she snaps right out of it.  She is very bright, a good student, highly social and athletic.  I've known something is not quite right since she was a baby but we still dont know what it is.  She was tested as a toddler with results of normal brain activity.  This is really starting to impact her studies as it causes so much wasted time in class.

112,Hand Flapping While Daydreaming,"
I have what I think is the same thing to what several people here have described. Since I was a toddler I would ""shake"" as my parents called it. They had me tested for seizures and unusual brain activity, but revealed nothing. I know I wasn't doing it whenever I was examined. I learned not to do it in front of anyone. I can't even do it in front of a mirror anymore. It is entirely voluntary, but something that I feel I need to do every day.
When I daydream, I clench my hands together in an unusual way, and my arms, though limited by my clasped hands, move somewhat spastically. My breathing pattern is also abnormal when I daydream, I guess similar to an apnea. I know I make odd facial expressions as well. And when I do it, I get flushed in a splotchy way, particularly my chest and neck. Like everyone else, I don't have any learning or social disabilities. If anything, I have excelled academically and was very talented in visual arts and sports. I was an awkward teenager, and didn't have a lot of friends as a teenager, but was very close to the friends I had. Once out of high school I became very social and popular, mainly when I started dating. I have had a few flings and a few serious relationships, currently in a serious relationship - pretty normal for a 27 year old lady. I do have problems with procrastination, and still haven't finished college, but have a very good job working at an ivy league university, where I take classes part time. I don't think one would associate my not finishing school with my daydreaming habit. It was very important to me to be financially independent from my parents as soon as possible, and I have been since I was 18. That was more important to me than going to school full time. The career success I have had since then, really I think can be attributed to being smart, driven, and able to network well.
I do have a brother who if evaluated I think would be diagnosed with some degree of Asperger's. My other two brothers are fine. Almost all of the males in my mother's family have had some sort of learning disabilities, and one of my maternal aunts reportedly does the same thing that I have done my whole life. When I was a child my grandmother used to tell me that it was okay, that my aunt used to do the same thing that I did when she was a little girl, and she grew out of it. When I got a little older, I told my mom that I still did it, just not in front of anyone, and she told me that my aunt told her that she still does it. She then went further to tell me that my aunt said that it was something that she ""had to do"" and that she finds it is a way to manage stress. I found that interesting, because I felt the same way about it, but had never told anyone about it. It convinced me that it really is the same thing. I've never talked to my aunt about it. I'm not close to her, and it is something that seems to be a secret.
Aside from being rather time consuming, I don't think it is a problem. It is not something I seek help for, but I am curious to know what it is.

This often involved walking (in a somewhat jerky fashion) around the house while his head would bob or twitch.  We have since read that this is referred to as ""stimming"".  It's not only people on the spectrum that do this, but others that have difficulty in processing all the sensory inputs they face in a day.  This is their way of diffusing all their pent up energy. People with sensory integration issues also experience ""stimming"" behavior.  Google these terms and you might find more answers to your questions.  Good luck!
And p.s. we all have our ways of ""coping"" - so there's nothing ""wrong"" with stimming - it's just more noticeable!

114,Hand Flapping While Daydreaming,"
Ok, this is interesting. I've been doing some strange movements while playing and imagining things or daydreaming all my life. I also frequently flap my feet or use something to flap with my hands while I am concentrating on stuff I have to study. It helps somehow and I think it looks kinda similar to what fauxnom described above. I would not consider myself as autistic although I had trouble with eye contact until adolescence, several social problems with peers as a kid and teenager and was always quite focused on rather unusual topics for my age. But I was also a really good student, quite early in learning how to talk and read and calculate. Now (26) I am a rather social person and only maybe a bit awkward in social situations. In Tests I usually score as an ""Aspie"", but I am also quite good with facial expressions and emotions. Can this be?

A neuropsych test would give you a better answer, however, given that you've learned to cope well with the few ""aspy""-like behaviors you present, it really wouldn't serve any useful purpose - plus it's expensive.  Many aspies are very high functioning on an academic level, so it wouldn't be surprising if you were.  Accepting that whatever you do to help yourself succeed (be it repetitive movements, or just acknowledging you need a little more time to be comfortable in social situations), is your normal and is okay, is the biggest thing.  Best to you!

Well, thanks a lot. It's just somehow important to know that I am not the only one doing odd things and functioning a bit different than most other people. But hey! Who wants to be ""most other people""? I would say that as a child I was probably on the spectrum but I learned to cope and am now doing really well. I hope that your son will be able to deal with his differences and be happy with it.

I also do this.  I have ""flapped"" my hands for as long as I can remember.  I had to adjust when I started going to school though.  I went from flapping my arms, somewhat like a bird, to only shaking my wrists/hands with my arms at my sides, so that it would be less noticeable. I still do this now, and I am 22 years old.  It only happens when I am excited or concentrating/thinking about something.  I do not know that it is happening when it starts to happen, but if I do happen to notice it, then I will stop doing it.  I also sometimes bite my tongue while doing this.  Like others have said, I am somewhat a shy, quiet person, but I do not feel like I have terrible social skills.  I am able to function normally.  For instance, I was able to attend and graduate from college, and I have made many friends.  I just sometimes wonder why I still do the ""hand flapping,"" and I wonder if it means anything.  I also have some OCD tendencies, like counting, but I have never seen anyone about it, so I do not have an official diagnosis of it.  I am not sure if that would be relevant to this subject or not. If anyone has any thoughts about this, I would appreciate it.

My sister has some strange disorder since her childhood. Even at the age of 16 she doesn't understand what we talk and can not talk . She just cries whenever she is thirsty or hungry or just keep on shouting, in a strange way, whenever she wants. Up to age of 8-9 she could walk but now she can not, since she continuously keep on sitting  by folding her legs. She feels strain when we try to straighten her legs.
The basic problem is inability to communicate. It seems to be some kind of metal disorder not just Autism.

Hey,  
 
My boyfriend has a problem where when he talks he sometimes uses the wrong words in sentences. 
 
He's very good and writing and language and has a wide range of vocabulary and is an overall bright and intelligent 21 year old, but in conversation he often has to pause to remember words, and it may take him a minute or so to select the word he means. 
 
For example 
'I'm leaving in 5 minutes to catch the...err..car...bus....' 
'Do you mean the train?' 
'Yeah the train' 
 
He is diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome, ADHD, social anxiety, depression. 
Is this the result of one of these conditions or is it a completly new problem, like a stuttter etc?

Ever since he was 5 months old he would always have this repetitive hand movement opening and shutting his hands all day over and over he would never stop unless to sleep. Now at 18 months he still does these things but add to hitting every object in the room he can find and this is also non stop repetidly. He also hits his mouth really hard over and over again to where he hurts himself pretty badly. He spins in circles a lot and he throws horrible tantrums. It's getting to be a lot and I'm still just trying to get ideas on if this is SPD or something else. He is a great sleeper, great eater, he took a while to walk and crawl but now he does it no problem, he can't talk except for saying mama and meme other than that he babbles all day but while he's babbling he's hitting everything and I can't make him stop and if I do he throws a tantrum and 5 seconds later he's hitting himself and everything again it's like his brain won't let him stop hitting and it's really hard to see. He does it from the time he's awake to the time he goes to sleep. He doesn't really ""play"" with toys he scratches objects. He also claps over and over again repetidly in a bad way.

132,"Help!!  unusual behavior ~ temper tantrums, fits of rage (Page 1)","
I really need some useful advice.  My five year-old daughter has fits of rageâ¦..now when I tell people this they usually say, âwhat five year-old doesnât have an occasional fit?â  No, itâs not just a fit. My daughter throws herself on the floor and injures herself.  Screaming so hard she throws up or gets a bloody nose.  She has kicked holes in her door and wall when we try to discipline her by putting her in her room.  And they can last for hours and hours.  
It seems like she has unusual behavior for a five year-old.  When sheâs having a fit or about to, she wants things done a certain way.  Like almost OCD.  An example is:  When she is throwing a fit, she wants me to pick her up in front of her by her head in just a certain way.  Now maybe this is her way of controlling the situation, but, it is the only thing that will calm her down.  If I do not do things a certain way, these âfitsâ  will last hours.  
I have talked to my pediatrician about this.  But he just doesnât get it.  Unless you see her in action itâs hard to grasp.  And I do not want to put my daughter in a situation where she is medicated.  Maybe there is even a bookâ¦..any suggestions?

There are so many possibilities. It's difficult to say what's going on without seeing her. Is she in Kindergarten? If she is in Kindergarten and demonstrates behaviors there, perhaps you can ask the school psychologist and other staff members to observe her in the classroom and start from there. Regular pediatricians are not behavioral specialists or psychologists; it's not their area of expertise. I would want to know what happens when she throws these tantrums. There is usually a reason, such as overstimulation in the environment or like you said, she wants things done in a specific way. Did she attain her developmental milestones on time? How is she with her adaptive skills such as daily living skills, communication, socialization?? There are just so many questions. The behavior that you described is atypical of a five year old. Usually five year olds will have fits, may throw themselves on the ground when not getting there own way but they don't do so to the extent you are talking about. You are doing the right thing by seeking answers. Often times, parents of young kids don't know who to go to besides their pediatrician. Some are good but they are medical doctors. They can rule out medical diagnosis but are not typically mental health professionals. Much too often people rely on what they say as the ""sole"" answer. 
Do you live near a Children's Hospital? Do you have good insurance? Children's Hospitals usually have pretty good clinical psychologists.

Thanks for the fast reply!  She is in Kindergarten.  But she is a different little girl in school and most public places.  Very reserved, shy, quiet, sweet.  (She is also very sweet at home, when sheâs not having a melt down.)  And I do not believe her school has a psychologist.  They have a nurse and counselors.  
Some of the time the tantrums are do to over-stimulation, sugar, or lack of sleepâ¦..but I do not believe itâs the cause.  Those elements do cause for us to have a worse day, but, we are very careful and it is rare for a sugar over-load or lack of sleep.  Plus there are plenty of days when a melt down comes out of no where.  And itâs almost always because things are not done a certain wayâ¦..not because sheâs not getting her way.  She wants it done a specific way.  I hope that makes sense.  
As far as her behavioral skills, she is a normal five year-old girl.  She has always been average or above average.   
We do have good health coverage.  And we do live close to a Childrenâs Hospital.  I just am a little naÃ¯ve and do not want my little girl to be poked and prodded at.  And actually I do not even know where to start.  Do I just call Childrenâs up?

My suggestion is that you bring your child to see a child psychologist, as soon as possible let them see what's is it that makes your child behave that way it's better to consult them now than later, the earlier the better, prevention is better than cure.

Honestly, it's a good thing that she is a different child in school and in public. If they haven't seen any of the behaviors your are seeing, it means that she can control it to some point. If she in kindergarten for a few hours a day, there is a possibility that she just hasn't had any of those behaviors because school is not long enough. School is a place that a lot of children with behavior difficulties will melt down due to overstimulation, lack of control over their environment and having to deal with so many different children (just to name a few reasons). 
I would call up the psychology department at children's hospital and speak with the receptionist. Ask her about the steps to get your child seen. Since her behavior only occurs at home, I don't think they will ""poke or prode"" her. They may either do a full psychological assessment or consult with you to give you ideas on what to do. When we have children whose behavior is a little out of the norm, it usually helps to have someone else help us to think outside of the box. 
You may want to call the school psychologist and talk with him or her about what you are going through. They also may know more about resources in your community and can help steer you in the right way. At least they can be a good person to consult. 
Good luck

On the 5th day of the diet, my then 4yr old was a completely different (sweet & compliant) child. At that age it only takes 4-5 days to see the results.

He throws himself down slams his head in the wall, screams for hours crys loudly, throws toys, breaking them.

THey tell me they don't have time for his behavior and it is distracting the other children. He is a very intelligent child, acedemically he is suceeding, but socially I feel he is drownding. He is aware of his fits, we talk about them once he has calmed down. He is not able to control them, he crys and tells me he doesn't want to do it any more, but he can't stop. I'm so afraid for him! At first we thought that his behavior was just a spoiled child not getting his way, we tried to take things from him, grounded him gave him time out. This has no effect on him! Punishments make it worse, it is like a total break down for him. Most of these fits happen at home, and just recently he began them at school. The doctors and the counseling center have never seen one in action.

I have a 5 yr old step-daughter who acts the same way as everyone has posted on here.  No one believes us when we tell them about these fits.  They say different things like ""oh, it's because you're not consistent, oh she's not on a routine, oh she consumes too much soda, oh she doesn't get enough rest.""  well ya know what?!? - neither did I when I was little and I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no one else I know did either - but I have NEVER EVER seen fits of rage such as my step-daughters. I've been doing a little research here online and the closest thing I can come up with is Bipolar disorder.  It's so rare for it to come out in little kids, but she fits all the criteria.  Right down to having a direct family member with bi-polar disorder.  I don't think her mother has ever been diagnosed, but they both go through the highest of highs and the lowest of low's at the drop of a hat.  It's crazy.  I'm definitely calling a child psychologist on monday (since it's July 4th weekend) and getting her in to be seen.  She barely has any friends that want to hang out with her and it's getting to be an everyday thing - where NOTHING helps.  We've tried every disciplinary action possible - no effect.  Tonight, we had to literally pick her up and put her in the tub, her mother had to climb in to wash her up while I held her still so no one would slip and fall.  Different things trigger it .... tonight it was the tub, 2 nights ago it was me washing her feet before she got into bed, a few nights before that it was because her cousin touched her favorite toy, sometimes it's because the girls next door have to go inside, one time it was because she accidentally broke her snow globe - all fo these things have sent her into fits of RAGE that last for hours - crying, screaming, flailing on the floor, banging her head against the wall, ripping posters off the wall, pulling her curtains down, etc, etc, etc.  So .... at this point, we are also at our wits end and I'm definitely calling someone on Monday ... hope we all get the help we need.

Im the father of twins that are almost 6. 
We have been dealing with this same behavior for a few years.
In the last few months it has began to escalate into more and more violent rages...
Same as a lot of you are saying, once in the ""fit"" (which lets not even us that word, it is a full blown rage) they are hyper-angry and completely unreachable.
Usually the behavior will stem from not getting what they want, Or being told to put away a toy or game or something...  
THey have began to hit and scratch us to the point that we look like battered spouses.  And that is hard on the ego as I am a big guy...   
My wife and I are feeling at a loss.  
Our kids are NICU babies born 2 months early at 4 lbs each...
Our life has consisted of ""managing their outbursts and fits"".
THey can happen any time (at home 99% of the time).
at least 4 days a week, I'll wake up to them punching and kicking each other over the top of me.  
Then the hitting, scratching, pinching, kicking of me begins...
They have been on a gluten free diet for a couple of years.  
It has made only the smallest of dents in things.  
Feels helpless when we are in it...

I know the feeling of growing up the way you have, my growing up was quite difficult. I have never actually been diagnosed with AS but I have been told by many people that I show signs of AS. I am a difficult and awkward person and find many things difficult especially social interaction. I have been bullied, poked and prodded all my life by people who dont or cant understand me and try to change me instead of accepting me. I havent many friends and have felt alone all my life. 
Getting an assesment is difficult at best as each case is different. If you have difficulty understanding people or with social interaction, often take things literally, have difficulty adjusting to new situations, find it hard to form and maintain relationships, feel awkward and that you dont fit in and no one understands, have difficulty expressing your feelings and showing emotion, understand things differently to others, have abnormal and or repetitive interest, then you most likely have got AS. You just need to pester your doctor to refer you and try to find care and support groups that your doctor could refer you to.

Thank you for askingTazman!
 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental condition of inattention and distractibility, with or without accompanying hyperactivity. In the past, various terms were used to describe this condition, including hyperactive syndrome and,  ""minimal brain dysfunction."" . In the DSM-IV-TR, adults or children must have had an onset of symptoms before age 7 years that caused significant social or academic impairment. More recently, attention has focused on adult forms of ADHD, which probably have been underdiagnosed.You are not alone in this.Incidence in school-age children is estimated to be 3-7%.you will need Behavioral psychotherapy,Cognitive therapy for adults with ADHD,Psychosocial interventions and medicinal interventions with a constant touch to a psychiatrist.
  Also bipolar disorder is a mood swings disorder and it also need alot of effort with a psychiatrist's help to combat the issue.Dont worry.
I hope it helps

Hmmm, I think this is a very complicated question.  In general terms, as I understand it, Asperger's and Autism are not hereditary in themselves, but the likelihood of developing these conditions are.  As I understand it, they are very complicated conditions that seem to have different triggers in developing the disease for different people.  As such, I would highly recommend, that since you know there is a chance of being hereditarily predisposed to developing either of these conditions, it would be in your child's best interest to do whatever you can to avoid triggers.  Some known triggers are caesin, gluten, certain vaccines, artifical sugars, certain chemicals in food, etc...  It would also be in your husband's best interest to avoid triggers as well as they not only trigger the condition but are known to aggrivate the condition and make it worse.  You need to do research on the internet.  Read as much as you can.  I think you will be surprised to learn that there are things you can do to help your baby.

Yes, Aspergers can be hereditary. My daughter was daignosed with this at age 12 years as the doctors all said ADHD, as it can be misdaignosed as there are alot of similarities with ADHD. She now has a 4 year old that is showing signs of Aspergers and the doctors are addressing this but unfortunately he is still too young to be properly daignosed. Aspergers is part of Autism family but the austism Association is still looking into how it is connected. There are two types of Aspergers - 1. Is the brain in overdeveloped while the body is underdeveloped 2. Is the brain is underdeveloped and the body is overdeveloped.  My daughter has the later, she reached puberty at the age of 9 years old. It is mostly as Social problem as well.

I am saddened that people still think that having AD is a curse. I am 24 years old, and I have Asperger's Disorder. I consider it a gift, without it I would not have had the experiences I've had in my life (both good and not so good.) I have a family that loves me; no matter how much I drive them crazy and visa versa; friends that have my back when things get bad, and am persuing a carreer in the medical field. 
Hans Asperger was quoted during the Nazi regime defending the need for people who have similar diagnosis as me saying, ""We are convinced, then, that autistic people have their place in the organism of the social community. They fulfill their role well, perhaps better than anyone else could, and we are talking of people who as children had the greatest difficulties and caused untold worries to their care-givers.""
We are called ""Little professors"" because of our knowlage. We are human beings, and the strength of our character shines through when we are given a chance. 
We do not need sympathy, as it implies that we are something that is not worth a second glance. We need acceptance. Fear of having a child that is not ""normal"" has caused nothing but hurt.
So, ask again if this diagnosis is a curse. I sure do not think so. If anything, it has made me stronger.

Wow, I like your outlook.  Though undiagnosed, I think Asperger's runs in my family - my Nana, father, sister, niece probably had/have it - and I have tendencies towards it as well.  My oldest son (15) has it, and we think one of the twins (13) does as well.  We had him tested a few years ago, and they came up ADD.  As most of us know, one can be mistaken for another, and we're waiting for him to be test specifically for Asperger's.
The diagnoses don't change who the people are, but help others to understand them, and them to understand and accept themselves.  I explain it to people this way:  the majority of people think in one direction, forward, if you will.  Those with true autism or other major issues think sideways or backwards.  They live in their own world, and have little or no understanding that another world exists.  Sadly, we aren't able to have them become a large part of our lives due to the different worlds we live in.  People with Asperger's or other ASD's, though, think a bit off to the side.  They think differently, but DO understand that the majority of people are forward-thinking.  This is a great example of thinking outside the box.
The world needs these people, and should rejoice in having them in their lives.  It is believed that Bill Gates and Albert Einstein both have/had Asperger's.  I often use them as examples of how much the world can benefit from them and to positively influence my boys.
Sadly, my father, sister and niece have never been diagnosed, and won't listen to the possibility that they might indeed have it.
I hope other Aspies and parents of them read this and get something positive out of it.  Yes, it can be hard, but it can also be great.

I totally agree with you Aspergers Syndrome is a gift!  
My son is 15 and is the most loving, caring witty and intelligent young man I could wish for.   He was finally diagnosed at about 8 years old and since then our family have supported him tirelessly to understand the way the world works and how to understand the social norms that are required to get on in life.   He understands that he thinks differently to the majority of his peers and has a deep understanding of the differences between them - unlike his peers who are very limited in their understanding.    He too is hoping to go into the medical field and is a very inteligent young man.  
When we finally understood why he was the way he was we realised that his dad also has Aspergers and many of our family members have traits.   My daughter is expecting a baby early next year and we hadnt even thought about the possibility of the baby having it as it isnt such an issue  it just takes a little patience and a different parenting style.

LOL We are still in the process of this new way of thinking and for him on how to deal with the OCD aspect of it.  We were told by his psychologist that it can passed on in family but not necessarily from direct parents or at all.  In fact, according to Dr. Tony Attwood the father may take on many of the Asperger's traits of their child.  Its very true in this case. My father in law can be very Aspie with his knowledge of everything and social issues.  However, he has never been evaluated nor had the need.  He has held down a job and does very well in life.

I agree that Aspergers should not be considered a disorder. My boyfriend of 14 months was diagnosed as a child, 15 or so years ago, which I only found out very recently. He was afraid to admit this to me, as he was worried I would see him differently and worry that our children would end up with Aspergers as well. Had he not told me he had been diagnosed, I never would have known, dispite studying years of psychology at university. He is one of the most brilliant people I know, having recently graduated from engineering at a presigious university. The way I see it, Aspergers comes with its advantages and disadvantages. He worked extremely hard on improving his social skills throughout primary and high school, to the point where it is unlikely he would be rediagnosed with Aspergers at this stage. It is definitely not a curse, and in many ways can be a great gift. There is nothing I would like more than for our children to take after their father in every way.

There are more than 2000 types of Ganoderma, you need to know which species and which company you are buying from. The best is to ask whether their Ganoderma is sold in Japan & whether it obtained Japan Government's certification.  If not, don't consume.  If both of the above requirements are satisfied then you can give to your kid, if not don't.  Japan is very strict when it comes to Ganoderma, any foreign Ganoderma that wants to penetrate into Japan must be better than the locals otherwise they cannot go in and with the Japan government's certification you can rest assured that it is safe already.  Ganoderma can be consumed by any age because it is a superior herb and it is very effective for brain development & autism.  You just have to find a good one

I am sure there are plenty of extremely loyal Christian families with autistic family-members. Or better yet, there are plenty of autistic Christians. So why would some equally pious Christians be ""healed"" and others not?
Christ is/was a fantastic symbol, role-model, historic voice, human being, savior, etc. But I feel as if his existence has been seriously misused and misunderstood in many circumstances. 
And I am a Buddhist-Christian, my healing comes from within and from compassion, and from attempting to live a wholesome and healthy lifestyle. Autism can be grown out of, to try and be on subject at all. All I got.

208,Is my son autistic,"
My 3 year old is being evaluated by a preschool Thursday and I am terrified they will say he is autistic. 
He is 3 and has only a few words. Stop, no, go and mama. The rest is initelligeble babble. 
He understands a lot of what you tell him and follows instructions but won't answer questions like ""are you hungry""? By shaking his head. I think this is my fault for not asking enough questions though. But if he doesn't want to do something or doesn't want something you are giving him he shakes his head no. 
He waves points, returns smiles, imitates, etc. He has good eye contact and like playing a game where I cover my face and each time I remove the cover my facial expression changes. He knows how to give high fives and fist bumps. 
The thing is he is very hyperactive. He cannot sit still. He is constantly on the go. Running, jumping playing very loudly. He babbles to himself very loudly and is always squealing and laughing loudly while doing this. 
He also likes to climb things. The stairs, furniture, etc. Once he used a crutch leaning against a bookshelf as a ladder to get some candy I put on the top. If he wants it he'll find a way to climb if I won't give it to him. 
I'm worried because I read that hyperactivity combined with speech delays is almost always autism or pddnos... 
But he does not seem to have sensory issues. He doesn't have a problem with any textures, sights or sounds or get upset at a change in routine or anything like that. 
I don't know how he is socially. He has never been around a child his age and doesn't meet strangers often. Although when he does he doesn't seem to have issues with them. Sometimes he is overly friendly . He has tried to kiss strangers he meets. 
I was worried he might have glue ear because he often acts like his right ear is itchy and sometimes he whines and holds it. He is also congested and breaths out of his mouth. His moth is always open so he drools. 
But when I took him to his ped she said his ears looked fine. Plus as I said he follows instructions and responds to his name almost 100% of the time. 
When he wants something he leads me and his father to it, brings it to us or points.. is it possible this is a sensory process disorder or adhd. I was diagnosed with adhd when I was around his age.

209,Is my son autistic,"
Symptoms during childhood
Symptoms of autism are usually noticed first by parents and other caregivers sometime during the child's first 3 years. Although autism is present at birth (congenital), signs of the disorder can be difficult to identify or diagnose during infancy. Parents often become concerned when their toddler does not like to be held; does not seem interested in playing certain games, such as peekaboo; and does not begin to talk. Sometimes, a child will start to talk at the same time as other children the same age, then lose his or her language skills. They also may be confused about their child's hearing abilities. It often seems that a child with autism does not hear, yet at other times, he or she may appear to hear a distant background noise, such as the whistle of a train.
With early and intensive treatment, most children improve their ability to relate to others, communicate, and help themselves as they grow older. Contrary to popular myths about children with autism, very few are completely socially isolated or ""live in a world of their own.""

211,"The Relationship between Imagery, Dyslexia, Hyperlexia and Autis","
Three  sensory-cognitive processing factors underlie language and literacy skills.  Concept Imagery-the ability to image gestalts-is critical to cognition.  Phonemic Awareness-the ability to perceive the number, order and identity of  sounds within words-is critical for reading and spelling. Symbol Imagery-the  ability to visualise letters within sight words-is critical for phonemic  awareness, spelling and contextual reading fluency. Comprehension and critical  thinking require ability to ""dual code"" information-in mental images  and language. Some individuals have weakness in concept imagery and do not  image ""gestalts"" for language. 
They retain  only details or parts of information and struggle with higher order thinking  skills. These individuals are often diagnosed as Hyperlexic, mildly Autistic or  with Asperger's Syndrome. In addition, inaccurate reading prevents or disrupts  imagery. Accurate decoding requires phonemic awareness, which is implicated as  the most pervasive cause of decoding and spelling problems, including those  severe enough to be labelled ""dyslexia"". 
For decoding  and spelling skills to become fluid, phonemic awareness must cross a threshold  to visual imagery for letters and sight words-symbol imagery. When this  function is weak, individuals spell phonetically and have low reading rates and  word recognition skills. Diagnosing and stimulating these three  sensory-cognitive functions is critical to language and literacy  development.  Lindamood-BellÂ®pr
ograms  are made up of a series of specific practices, each targeting these essential  skills that are critical to the reading process.

215,Aspergers Syndrome,"
Hi, 19 years of age and I have been told a few times that I show signs of Aspergers. I have never been tested for AS but I do have the learning disability dyspraxia. From what I have read about AS, I would say that i show a lot of the symptoms. I never have difficulty in understanding people or what they mean, but I do have difficulty when interacting with people as I tend to take things literally. I have no problem in understanding anothers feelings but dont know what to say or do to make people feel better. I have an abnormal amount of different interest, some which people think are weird like collecting stones. I would consider myself to be a bit eccentric, I always stand out where i go and have trouble fitting in. I am a somewhat awkward person without a lot of friends, really only 3. I have difficulty forming relationships and maintaining them. I have a lot of confidence and emotional issues. I feel closed off from people and have difficulty getting close to people. I am overly sensitive and emotionally vulnerable to things around me. I often spend my time repeatedly reading the same books or watching the same shows. I dont go out much and rarely find myself in a situation where i can meet new people. Do i have Aspergers?

218,Aspergers?  Or is she just unfriendly for some reason?,"
I have a 24 yr old acquaintance who used to be a classmate at school. I've known her since she was 4 and have always found her behaviour odd. She never spoke at school. If you tried to say hello to her and speak to her she wouldn't say anything back and didn't seem to like it. If she asked to hang around with you at lunch or break she'd never talk to you either. If you text or email her she won't reply, but she's perfectly open and talkative to her family. She's never shown any interest in her appearance or the sorts of things other girls her age are interested in. She's also very dependent and reliable on her parents even at this age. As she's got older she does talk a litle more openly but you still can't really have a proper conversation with her. She's a clever girl and is now working as a maternity burse. Does she have aspergers? Or is she just unfriendly for some reason? Her sister's are both very sociable and completely different to her.

Best not to jump to conclusions based off on things that could be taken either way, you've been her freind for 20 years now i think you should know whats best for her and you; and good luck.

221,My husband has asperger's and I am scared to become pregnant,"
We've been married for 9 months and together for 2 years. We have had so many arguments, every time I try to have a normal conversation with him , it turns into an argument. It is very tough to have a conversation back and forth with him. I will ask him something and his answer will be one word, 'yes' or 'no', or 'okay'. Sometimes I tell him what seems to me a big news and I expect a reaction from him or to share his feelings with me or get excited for me and all he says is 'that's good honey'. He is an amazing human being who is very intelligent, compassionate, and is on top of his career. But, the longer I live with him, the more I realize that I'll get to live a life of no laughter and excitement. He has the most beautiful smile, he really does look like a model, but you'd never know because he hardly smiles. Nothing seems humorous to him. I miss his smile so much. He thinks I don't try to understand him and that I label him as 'odd' and he has mentioned he has asperger's to me before but I never looked into it. So, today I took the time to read about it. I never knew it was autism related, I had no idea. I wish so much I looked into this earlier on. The scary part about all of this is that I may be pregnant and now I'm so scared to have a child with asperger's. I am sorry to offend anyone who has asperger's by this topic. I know I sound so selfish but I am really trying hard to understand him, that's why I married him, I love him dearly. I guess I really don't know what to do now. I don't want to leave him because of this syndrome, it is not his fault, and I don't want him to be alone, I cry just thinking about it, but at the same time, I have to think about my life and if I want to live it this way. Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts. I'd love to hear from women who are married to a man with asperger's and how you've learned to live and be happy with him.

My husband has Aspergers too but its honestly not as scary as it seems. I recommend searching around online for some books to read about marriage and aspergers. That will help you a lot. I'm in the same boat as you because I am pregnant with my first child. My husband and his mother both have aspergers so I know there a good chance my son (we just found out its a boy!) will have it too. There are some advantages and disadvantages to being with someone who has aspergers but you must judge each situation individually. My husband is wonderful. He takes care of everything and even helps me clean the house. He's pretty easy to please and once you understand how to communicate with your husband effectively then things will be so much smoother.

Just because he doesnt show humour or express his feelings doesnt mean he doesnt have them. Its difficult for someone with AS to express emotion. Most of the time he probably thinks its funny but it doesnt occur to show he finds it funny and when you tell him something big, hes probably thrilled and excited and proud but doesnt know how to express his feelings. Its hard flr him to interact because he doesnt feel like he fits in and maybe had a hard time growing up so he closed off emotionally, a lot of people with AS are like that. They live in their own bubble and its hard for them to come out. He will definitely feel misunderstood because its hard for people to see or understand things from his perspective. And its never really been proven that people with AS will pass it on to their children. You have just as much chance as having a child with AS as without even if you were with someone who doesnt have AS. You just have to try things together so he can come out of his comfort zone, his bubble, and he will open up more. Try things he feels uncomfortable with like maybe interacting with people, and start small like get him used to being around other people more often. Just little things like that will help a long way and show him that your there behind him and you support him. Hope this helps

I'm a man who has AS. I've never been diagnosed but I know it runs in my family. I also am self aware of how I act, my emotions and my lack of skills in communication. I'm a master manipulator who can put on a good face when needed but left drained and exhausted when trying to act socially ""normal."" We are human beings who love immensely but fail miserably at showing it most of the time. My fianc is pregnant with our child and most of the time I feel lost. 
I look at my siblings and their very distant relationships (all are divorced or separated, etc.) and realize that I may never be able to sustain a long healthy relationship because of how taxing it is on my significant other.  
I love my fianc more than words can express but I've come to the realization that we have every card in the deck stacked against us. I'm still going for it because she is the only woman I've ever felt this way about and who does understand me, for the most part. 
The best advise I can give you is that it will be a roller coaster. He won't understand most, or anything of what you're going through. But from my experience he must love you. I never lasted more than a few weeks with any other woman because I couldn't logically stay with anyone I didn't care about. It isn't completely about you now, if you are pregnant. I know this is an old post. My wish is that you were able to make it work but also the understanding that you do need to be happy. If you can't find that fulfillment with a partner with AS, there's no shame in that. We all should know that it is extremely challenging to make it work and I'd venture to say most fail in regular relationships let alone when a partner has AS.

228,Toddler almost 2 possible stimming?,"
My son is a year and a half and about 18 months I realized he was OBSESSED with saying the word CAR. it got to the point where other words he would say before he no longer really says even though i know he can, for example the word door.
when we go out everything (unless it is a tree) he calls a car. he says car car car car...over and over again...I thought it was bc I say hold my hand we have to watch out for cars...but it is at the point wehre he touches parked cars, all over them...is obsessed with garages and waits for cars to go in and out.
Aside from this, he really never plays with wheels or spins wheels, but he is just now getting little cars as toys (small toy parts were a no no)so i have to observe that action.
He spins around a lot and shakes his head to get dizzy for a long time and often during the day and week,months... i always assumed he was playing. He also has this funny walk and has done it more lately he shuffles and toe walks at different points.mostly shuffles. he will get mad easily and yell/scream ball his fists and stand on his tippy toes??
he screams to get my attention (i think) instead of using words like more or sippy but he will open the fridge and scream.
If I tell him to stop slamming cabinets he throws a temper tantrum and might bite his arm and lays on the ground flailing.
He is biting his nails for like a month now all day through out the day and legit until he falls asleep, yet never had binky or sucking a thumb and is off the bottle.
I figured terrible twos with the fits, and the nail biting a nervous habit...but now I am freaking out because a program director asked me if I ever heard of EI and if I talked to my doctor about his milestones??
He says words, but seems to have lost some of them or is obsessed with others
but he NEVER cuddles unless it is on his terms, but he is a boy he is hyper and he almost never sits still unless it is a song or tv show he LOVES.

232,aspergers syndrome with signs of tourettes syndrome,"
Hi 
My son is 26 years old, he was diagnosed with aspergers syndrome about three years ago. As a child and a teen he had problems with social skills and sensitivity issues. He had alot of the typical symptoms of aspergers, however sinse aspergers was not a diagnoses in his childhood , twenty years ago he was only diagnosed with having ocd, but the more I learned about aspergers the more I knew he must have that. He never had any major issues until three years ago however. He started cutting himself, and having anger outbursts (melt downs) When he has an anger outburst he yells out things that dont make any sense, now we are thinking he has touretts syndrome. Does anyone know if touretts is at all associated with aspergers in adults?

233,aspergers syndrome with signs of tourettes syndrome,"
Both autism and touretts deal with tics so there could be some association between the two; but also it could be when hes angry like many other poeple he dosent always think about what he says, and maybe to him it makes sense. Was there anything 3 years or so ago the could have been a major change in his life or something like a death of a loved one(maybe even he didnt agree with the aspergers diagnosis idk), because it could also contribute heavly to the outbursts, and might help if delt with. Good luck sometimes it can be a rocky road with life but eventually you'll get through it.

234,Aspergers?  17 and I've really started to wonder,"
Hi there, I am currently 17 and I've really started to wonder some things. My girlfriends brother has aspergers and I've noticed a lot of similarities between him and I. Looking at this asperger-advice.com many of the symptoms I have. There are other symptoms I've noticed but I will compare what I've found below. I know nobody here can diagnose something as complex as aspergers, especially over the internet but I'm really looking for some advice. The last time I went to a doctor about having issues with focusing(I always have but its getting in the way of highschool where before I would just get by on natural smarts without studying and get 90's, I'm very impatient & not very good at sitting still/paying attention). The doctor did not take me very seriously and diagnosed me with depression, trying to prescribe me zoloft. I opted against it as I know that isn't my issue. One thing not listed below is that I also get VERY upset when hurt or in a situation that makes me angry. 
Since a child in situations like when a teacher was upset with me I would cry uncontrollably, if my sister made me angry I would have an uncontrollable rage combined with hyperventilation and uncontrollable crying. 
The most recent event of this is my stepfather made me incredibly angry and upset & I started screaming and crying uncontrollably, I broke my house phone and put a hole in my door. That was the first time for it to be that severe as I have gotten much better at managing these emotions with age and the aggression is not a very regular thing.
I do have a decent number of friends but many I do not hang out with much outside of sschool, I often have no interest in socializing outside of my room. I used to play world of warcraft however to which I played MANY hours a day and tend to enjoy socializing through these means much more. I would spend hours talking to online friends via voice chat programs through games like this. I find it a bit funny as well that I have a large interest in computers/electronics, always have and plan on doing engineering next year(which I said I would do when I was a kid), engineering is apparently another trend for people with aspergers.

235,Aspergers?  17 and I've really started to wonder,"
I have ADD, OCD, depression, anxiety, and my dad had all of these for 89 years.  Just happens to run in my family.  I have been on psych meds for 30 years and I absolutely hate them.  I have gone to an alternative healer in some small town out of this state and the whole mental mess is gone - in 5 minutes.  This man went to medical school, chiropractic school, studied in China for many years and I have never seen so many certificates on a wall in my entire life.  You have no idea that such things exist that will heal each and every person of every ailment on the planet.  Dump the drug bandwagon as soon as you can and that is what I plan on doing.  I have never taken any medication for my ADD - because I never knew I had it.  My mother introduced me to crystalized ginger when I was in 2nd Grade and I have one year of college with straight A's and 2 scholarships I left behind.  Don't ever give up.  There are things out there besides the O so rotten AMA and the Drug companies!!!  I have a son that is ADD with Asperger's syndrome that was on Vyvanse for 15 months (and hearing voices!!!) and adderall for the rest of the time.  He last took an adderall pill on the last day of high school and never again.  We have found alternative things.  Anything hot that gets the blood circulating will do the trick - ginger, cayenne pepper, hot peppers, curry, and add in Omega 3,6,9 fatty acids and try something called vincentopene (an extract from the Periwinkle plant) which helps the memory very much.  I just can't stress it enough.  I have said that the next time I am in the hospital, it will be over my DEAD body!!! Enough said!

If you show all these signs then you probably definitely have severe AS,ADHD,Learning difficulties such as Dylexia or Dyspraxia, Hypersensitivity, and if you repeeat the same things or have habits you cant break like maybe not going anywhere without having number of pens in your pocket, or maybe just walking on the left of things all the time, then OCD as well. However if you have had all these symptoms since you were young, im sure a doctor or teacher at school would have picked up on it and you would have been diagnosed. I dont think you show all these signs perhaps a few and its most likely you have adhd, i rather think you have been comparing yourself to the person with AS and have automatically assumed you show the same symptoms and you have been looking it up and assumed you show more symptoms. Dont get me wrong, i dont think your lying and its possible you have AS or ADHD, its just really unlikely to show all these symptoms without people picking up on it. My advice would be ask the people who know you best and ask their opinions, then go to your doctor.

240,Is it likely that I have Aspergers?,"
I neither watched T.V. nor went on a computer until I was of 6 years of age. I'm cross dominant(I think); I write with my right hand, but I play the piano, shoot a bow and arrow, etc. with my left hand. This is relevant because I'm physically clumsy, and I don't want to assume this is a symptom of Aspergers if my eye isn't correctly coordinated for some activities. My parents told me I flapped my arms and rocked back and forward for long periods of time in my high chair at a young age. Until 6th grade, I looked at socialization logically. Why would somebody invite me over to swim if they would have less room to swim than without me? My left leg is nearly always shaking, and I have compulsive desires about consistency. I'm often ""disconnected"", staring at objects but really looking inside my mind. I remember things from my very young childhood, such as my diaper being changed. I'm in Algebra 1(8th grade) and I can easily keep a 98 so far, but I'm very bad at social studies due to a lack of interest. It was decided that I was ready to start school despite being 4, and I have no trouble with school except with socialization. It's quite stressful; even moments such as when people walk by make me vey anxious. If they say ""Hello"", I'm unsure of whether to respond. I never speak to people I don't know well unless spoken to. If there is a person in my classes that I don't know well, then I make no attempt to ever know him or her well. My peers see me as a genius, though I doubt that. My grandmother talked to my parents about my having Aspergers, who later spoke to a counselor because of how upset I got when they took away my primary interest due to my spending an unhealthy amount of time with it. One person said that he was certain I had Aspergers, so after meeting with a social worker and psychiatrist, they both said that I did. The reason I'm posting here is because nearly all of my symptoms may have another explanation. My clumsiness might be due to cross dominance. My social unawareness may be simply due to inexperience. I'm 13 and I have few but (relatively) good friends. Do I have Aspergers?

241,Is it likely that I have Aspergers?,"
Probly not, it could be because your parents did't raise you quite right or the same way as other kids; or maybe you had few interaction with other kids your own age. You could be a naturally shy person who thinks a lot and maybe you don't get enough sleep most nights. The possibilities are endless. Just because you got diagnosed by a so called professional because your family thinks you act strange doesn't mean you have a mental illness; Actually aspergers is a very over diagnosed mental diagnosis probably because of normal shy and strange people get diagnosed for just acting the way teenagers or kids act, that and also the school and your parents might be able to get money form doing so. Any way even if you have aspergers, which i doubt you do, its not the end of the world just don't brag of boast(or even talk much)about it or people WILL stop talking to you because they think you cant communicate in basically the same way as anyone else.(sorry for the long post and) Good luck to you.
Ps. what was the thing you ""obsessed"" over being taking away; depending on what it is it could make sense that you'd get angry with it being taken away.

My son Dante' was diagnosed autistic at the age of 1.  He is particularly bright and academically advanced in many areas.  However, I cannot get him potty trained.  When I ask him to try to go potty, he has a fit and screams or he will go up and come right back down without even trying and tell me he couldn't go.  Once in awhile he does urinate.  He finally sat on the toilet for the first time a week ago and pooped on the potty a couple days ago and now nothing again.  I have awarded him for efforts and bigger awards for when he does go.  He is to be going into 1st grade soon and I want him to be trained.  He is academically at a 3rd grade level.  I would like to try to have him tested out of 1st grade but his behaviors and diapering are holding him back.  Do you have any other suggestions?  Is this typical for autistic children?]

Hi there
Can any of you with autistic children tell me if they 
suffer from severe fears? ie: Fear of the dark, 
Fear of going any where alone
Fear of not being liked
Fear of the wind
Fear of the toilet
Fear of monsters, aliens and ghosts
Fear of single large eye ((Something she insists is real is a large eyeball that is out to get her))
Fear of evil fairys, yep she believes that there are bad fairys and good fairys and that the bad ones are out to get her
Fear of Dying
Fear of loud sounds
Scared of music because she thinks that what she hears will stay in her brain forever and she'll not be able to get it out of her head
Fear of people talking about her
Fear of things getting into her eyes
Fear of diseases
Fear of photo's coming to life, or paintings or pictures coming to life
Fear of the black hole
Fear of spiders
Fear of lifts unless the lift is one of those types that have the massive window so you can see outside and or if the lift has a lot of people in it other wise she's too scared to ride one
Fear of being driven over the harbor bridge because she thinks a massive Octopus will come out the ocean and pull her into the sea
She fears tree's while bush walking because she convinces herself that the tree's will come alive and eat her
Scared of her bed because she believes that there are monsters living under her bed
Scared of being examined at the doctors 
Scared of an eye doctor looking into her eyes
Scared of being put to sleep in case she never wakes up
Fear of blood tests, she thinks it's poison
Scared to vomit
She believes strongly in monsters, aliens and ghosts no matter what and believes that someone is after her in the world
She believes in other worlds
And so many more fears, basically she's literally scared of everything even her own shadow is this all part of someone with Autism or could this be schizophrenia?  I will be asking her specialist to get her referred for a proper diagnosis but reading everything related to autism I have never seen another child with so many fears.  Her fears are ruling everyone in the family and they get worse not better and NO I do not encourage her fears at all I have tried so many things to help her but she is insistent on them being real to her.  She is nine years old

Im sorry if I was being abusive, I didn't think that I was at the time, had I known that I was I would've said it differently.
However, having to do with what I said earlier, alot of those are completely normal, well, not to say normal, but okay fears to have in a situation such as this.
But there is an eye somewhere, I don't know if this is metaphorical or not yet, but it's watching, and the only reason that I am writing this is you need to find out about certain things so that you can try and relate to her and lend her a hand and let her know that she isn't alone.
Faeries are real dude, all kinds've different things are real, and either people ignore it or don't know or just don't care.  And Im not talking about tinker bell at all here, it's completely different.  The word faerie tale probably actually originates with their actual existence.
And the wind thing, she is obviously aware of the stronger types of wind, I wouldn't say that she is afraid of any wind.
There are other worlds entirely.
Just saying, you seem to think that there aren't, but your daughter seems to be aware that there are, so you need to know that there are so that you actually can help your daughter.
Was this not helpful?  Im sorry if this is not helpful, I really think that it is though.
And I did an extemely small amount of reading on the octopus just now, and you may want to do some reading about it's symbology, ancient meanings, totems, dream meanings, etc.
Because why else would she be afraid of that?  There is no chance that it will actually happen, well at least not the octopus part.  There has to be something more to all this going on with your daughter.
And I really think that she will like certain kinds of music, not all of the time, but certain kinds seem to truly please autistic children actually, it must be music though and not that other stuff.

I too sometimes wonder if her fears aredue to the autism or if something else isgoing on. But i also feel that maybe she is more in tune with the whole of our world. My mother died from cancer when my daughter was 6 months old and yet she has told me things about her that she could not have known. I just try to reassure her that she's ok and try to vet her to tell me about what is scaring her and why. We discuss it matter of factly and it calms her and also allows me to learn more about her.

253,"2 year old not talking a single word, very noise sensitive","
hi really worried about my little boy. hoping someone will have some advice for me.
shane is our very happy little boy. he is now 2 years 3 months but still does not have a single word, not even mama or ta ta! however he never stops trying to speak. he has become very vocal and communicative since about 20 months. everytime he sees a train, bus etc he will shout aagh(his general word) again and again untill we say we the word. if we say the wrong word he will keep shouting, so he does know the word he is trying to say. 
he has been trying to say ""go"" for a good 8 months now and its still ""ugh""
 our speech therapist has made us realise he does have some of his own language however thay are all vowel noises and most of them are hard to distinguish from each other unless said in context. he also has a general aaghh... which he uses  
for eveything. for example he will use this for tractor or truck even though it sounds nothing like it.
 shane is very expressive and happy, loves playing hide and seek, going out on the road to play with other boys and girls, throwing the ball down the stairs to me, piggy backs , drawing with pens or markers. he is a real giggler.
 some of his play is repeptitive for e.g. when out with friends he likes being around them but is not really playing with them. he will spend a lot of time dropping stones down shores. 
when in bath he spends whole time pouring water from one cup to another again and again.
 shane also exhibits a strange behavior when excited. he will open his mouth wide while opening and closing his hands this could be while watching tv or watching a child swinging or truck passing etc... this usually last less than a minute.
 
shane has also been very noise sensitive even when he was only 4 months old after christening he was in pram in a pub for about an hour and he was upset by the background noise. could not settle. most babies would have slept through.
 at 4 months also i remember he didn't like to be held, preferred to lie in pram. not sure how long this lasted.
 
i remember when he was 1 we couldn't bring him to indoor play centres or even if his nannas house was full of kids he couldn't cope with the noise and i would have to bring him upstairs. 
if out in buggy would get very upset if passing a lawnmower or noisy traffic. his noise sensitivity is not as bad anymore (now loves play centre) but still terrified of hoover hairdryer stc... doesn't like singing for e.g. happy birthday.
 
gets upset when going into some rooms for e.g when he has appointments just wants to leave the room. even at mother baby group.
 here is another list of concerns about shane.
 
-only in last couple of months beginning to understand simple instructions like get your shoes. 
- poor imitating skills won't go nursery rhymes actions. very slow to pick up sign language,
 -although i think he knows a alot of body parts he won't point them out when asked. ( only head or nose then stops)
 -open mouth and hand clenching when excited
 -noise sensitve
 -doesn't like hair being brushed or hands washed.
 -hates swings, seems scared if put on one yet loves slide.
 -short attention span
 - repetitive play with stones and water
 -shane was quiet baby who stopped babbling around 16 months oldb
 
we have started pecs system with shane which he's picking up no problem.
has anyone onu there similar experience. poor mite is trying so hard to say words but they sound nothing like them.

One of the symtoms of autism is that someone with autism can't process information as well as others. The question is: How to determine that this is the result of autism and not because of some other complicated brain proccess? Or the lack of practise of the subject or something like that?

259,ASPERGER SYNDROME and SOCIAL CUES,"
Hi there
Autism and aspergers is the result of working with one side of the brain only. 
Usually  the logical side.
The emotional side does not get activated.
This is often caused by a malfunctioning corpus callosum, the body of nerve fibers connecting the two hemispheres of the brain
Signals constantly travel between the right and left brain and this gives us a complete picture of what is going on in the world.
It is a bit like looking at the world with only one eye. You lose perspective and depth.
General Moshe Dayan Lost an eye in a skirmish with the French in the desert and in his autobiography describes the difficulty of seeing with one eye. He could not judge distance and kept tripping over things.
Autism is similar. You need both sides of the brain to function in order to understand jokes.
One side hears the words, and the other side the meaning. If you put these two together you understand the joke.
A Florida researcher and his co-workers and colleagues have identified a milk protein, casomorphin, as the probable cause of attention deficit disorder and autism. They found Beta-casomorphin-7 in high concentrations in the blood and urine of patients with either schizophrenia or autism. 
The main protein in cow's milk is casein. This protein breaks down in the intestine to produce a peptide casomorphine, an opiate. Another researcher found that casomorphin could cause or aggravate the symptoms of Aspergers or Autism. 
Another researcher wrote; ""The quantities of these compounds, as found in the urine, are much too large to be of central nervous system origin. 
The quantities are such that they can only have been derived from the incomplete breakdown of certain foods."" 
Allergies causes incomplete breakdown of foods. 
And dairy is the most allergenic substance in the human diet. 
No other animal suckles from its mother after infancy.
Good luck

260,ASPERGER SYNDROME and SOCIAL CUES,"
There is a well supported theory that people with an autistic spectrum disorder, in most cases, have been deprived of oxygen during/after birth - this can cause brain damage, therefore, perhaps, damaging the part of your brain that controls said difficulties you are experiencing. However, this is merely what I have heard.

262,Aspergers Behaviour Control-how much do you ignore?,"
Hi
My 4 year old son has been refered for Autism as he has nearly every symptom apart from communication is fine and although still at nursery school is keeping up academically but not mixing and making friendships, so more likely to be Aspergers.
The referal will take around 6 months.
My problem at the moment is how to deal with the behaviour, can cope with all the other weird behaiour its the discipline and tantrums as just feel like constantly telling him off.  
How much do you ignore and how much do you discipline? Obviously when hes hitting, biting and punching I try to stop.  But when he's having a melt down do I just give him what he wants or carry on with half an hour battle of wills which is now daily.  I dont want to be doing him more damage if its what he needs to do  as they are very violent and emotional but, on the other hand dont want him to learn that can always get own way.
Any suggestions for how to manage would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks Lisa x

264,i think my 2 year old son has autism,"
cheeriobaby,
Autism is ""the"" disorder of the times.  The definition of autism has been expanded so much that is now includes many children, which in the past, would have just been considered ""unique"".  The development and habits of small children is so wide and varied, that it is really hard to say what ""normal"" milestones and activities should be (there are so many standardized “instruments” (mental, physical, emotional, social examinations and scales) to test children’s development out there right now).
Autism is no longer considered one condition, but is now called autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which includes a whole host of conditions.
Yes, there are some milestones that all children are supposed to reach by certain ages, but even with these, many ""normal"" children are outside of the standards when young, and end up doing very well as adolescents and adults.
While it used to be thought that autism was rare, the definition has been so broadened that the incidence of autism is now listed as 1 child in 88 has the disorder.  That would be considered a very common disorder.
This broadening can have many effects: One, it can get more money for the disorder;  It could bring in more research;  It can provide extra help in school for children; It can provide help/education to parents; It can worry parents that their child is somehow now abnormal and is going to have problems the rest of his/her life (which may not be true).  
If you Google “Incidence of autism, CDC), you can get a link to the CDC website on autism, with the statistics, incidence, diagnosis, and risk factors for the disorder.  On this website, in the diagnosis section, it does state that children as young as two can reliably be diagnosed with ASD.  But, when reading the summary for that statement, the article states that it is reliable if the patient scores high enough on the instruments at both the age of 2 and age 9.
Again, autism used to be considered a rare disorder decades ago, but over the past decade it has had its definition broadened to include a spectrum of like disorders under the umbrella of ASD.  True autism, where the patient is profoundly disabled is still quite rare.  As stated in the CDC website, “The majority (62%) of children the ADDM (Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring) Network identified as having ASDs did NOT have intellectual disability.”
Continue to work with your son’s pediatrician.  Again, many children with ASD do just fine.  Some need some help in certain aspects of their life (social, emotional, mental, psychological, etc).  But, very rarely are children disabled by autism.
Wishing you and your son the best.  Good luck.

Sounds like Aspergers to me. My family suggested that I should get tested for it, myself, but in reality, most people show some signs of the condition. If he is smart, and knows an awful lot about specific subjects, then chances are, that he is just smart, but if he displays a lot of other characteristics, especially social ones, then he may well be Aspergers. As it happens, I don't have autism, but show some traits of it, like most people. 
I researched about it a lot, because I didn't want to get labelled with something that I don't have, and realised that if people show one or two tendencies, then thats usually normal. The things to worry about, are if he shows lots of autistic/Aspergers traits, then he probably is, but that shouldn't mean that it's a bad thing. Don't treat him any differently than you would, before you knew about his issues.

Yes! Those are really awesome for those who have autism. Im glad that you purchased one with velcro.

272,Commitment issues/autism/depression? i need help!,"
I really need some answers, because this is driving me crazy and making me very isolated and depressed. 
 
 I have a big problem in relationships of all kinds and i feel there may be something wrong with me. 
 
 I find it very hard to make friends. I never know what to say to people to interest them, i feel very isolated in groups and even one on one conversation is hard. I am frequently told i interrupt people, i never seem to know when the right time to speak is, I am also seen by some people as rude and everyone notices that i act a bit strange. I get confused to why people think i am rude, when i think i have been very friendly. I am very shy, I find it hard to follow conversations and alot of the time other people speaking bores me. I hate small talk, not only do i find it difficult, i find it very boring. I find eye contact very difficult too. 
 
 I really like spending time alone, and when i feel i have been around people too long i need to be in a room alone to do my own thing. I am diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression and anxiety. 
 
 The world to me is a very scary and confusing place. I have never felt i fit in properly and have never felt a proper bond with anyone, not even my family. 
 
If someone seems to be interested in talking to me i get excited and become clingy straight away, and end up getting angry if they don't reply to my calls ect, which usually ends up with them ignoring me altogether 
 
 In romantic relationships i can feel very strong emotion first off. I have felt the feelings of being in love, but after time those feelings always go away for me, because i never feel a bond with anyone. I can like people, i can love people, but have a bond with them and understand them? i've never felt that way and i think that's what makes me not want to stay in relationships. All of my relationships have ended because i have become distant. I don't worry if the relationship will end I don't really care, i feel no bond with anyone other than i care about them and don't want to make them sad. And i really don't think this is normal. 
 
 I feel i will end up alone forever. I have been with my boyfriend for 2 and a half years, but i feel no romance for him anymore and there is no bond keeping me with him. I think about being without him and i know i will be lonely, but a part of me still wants to be without him and be alone.  
 
 I feel alot of the time i would be better off alone, I would love to be on an island somewhere with no one around, with just me, and i wouldn't have to wory about all the stresses people seem to be to me. Yet i feel so alone, and wish i could love like other people. 
 
I can't see myself getting married. When i am in a relationship and the loved up feeling is gone, i wish i was in another relationship. I know it's not him, i have been this way since i first started dating, and it's making me very miserable. 
 
 I can't keep friendships because of this, i can't keep jobs. Jobs are so difficult because people always notice i act strangly and i end up getting fired. 
 
I really would like some insight into this, because it's making me feel so isolated and depressed. I have even felt suicidal because of this too.

I feel so sorry you feel this way.  It is not your fault.  You crave a connection and a bond and at the same time want to be alone.  I get it.  Most people feel this way only in your case it seems very strong.  Try to accept it and realise that this loved up feeling you talk about is fleeting for everyone and usually replaced by real intimacy and a human connection, which will occur with the right person.  In the meantime, maybe if you did activities such as tennis, yoga, meditation it would help with the insatisfaction.  Eating healthy food - vegetables, pulses also helps.  Being in nature.

278,Does my brother have asperger's?,"
So my brother is 21 now has always been socially akward (shy). He never had many friends and currently (we moved a lot during our childhood) only has one ""friend"" who he sees 1 or 2 times a year and doesn't talk to a lot. 
He is currently doing another study after ditching his last one after only a week because he had to ""work to much together with other peers"".
He never goes out (has never been to a club or bar or anything really). He never throws a birthday party or really does anything with other people apart from our family even after being begged to come. He will usually make up a very lame excuse.
So what does he do? Well in his spare time he plays video games and guitar. But it's always the same video games and songs on his guitar. He only plays the same 3 games. He has completed these games many many times but always starts again to find that one thing he missed. In this aspect he is quite obsessive. On guitar he only plays songs from the same 3 artists. He only listens to music my parents used to put on in the car. So he is very nostalgic and absolutely hates change.
whenever me or my sister do something different he always seems to disapprove. He always sides with mom and dad and sometimes gets very angry at my little brother over little things.
He does well at school but sometimes says the dumbest things.
He has this weird tick thing where he breathes in very heavily with pauses in between and raises is arms and then breathes out. He can keep it in when there is company around though. It may have passed now as I have not seen him do it for some time but then I am not home very often (I have my own place in another city).
Also up until the age of 14-15 he would always stick the same two fingers in his mouth when going to sleep, like a baby kind of. Up until around the age of 8 he would also do this even when not going to sleep.
Despite all of this weird behaviour, he never seems depressed or anything and when at home he seems to be quite happy.
So, does anybody have any idea what my brother might have? I have done a little research and think he may have Asperger's or a different form of autism. Or is he simply just socially akward with a few weird quirks?
Also, should/can I do something about this? While I don't want to hurt him by telling him how weird he is and a part of me says to leave him as he is as long as he is happy, another part of me says to help him break free of this comfort shell that he has created.

there is a man that i live with in a care home which has autism, also may have some other mental illness. Last week he got into a fight because he couldnt get his own way and he ended up throwing a member of staff across the room, which resulted in him cracking a rib and breaking his wrist. also destroying quite a few household objects, smashing a chair into the table and nearly throwing the chair at me. the staffed tryied talking him down but he was just growling and his expression was very blank. 
he then ran upstairs got his coat, ran back down stairs and he ran out side and jumped over the fence onto the streets, with no staff intervention to restrain him, the police was not called and he has not been taken to a doctor. he then was confronted a week after at the dinner table and told what had happened to the member of staff which he threw, he looked down at the table and smiled and said ""have i killed him?"", he then started laughing and we then told him the member of satff was okay but in hospital, he then stopped laughing and said he was unwell and had to lye down. 
 
ive talked to the staff about it, and they said that they have new guidlines in place to stop it happing again. but i don't feel safe. is there anything which should be done? or say to somone about it. because i think that what he has done is worng and maybe classed as danger to him self and the public. 
So someone give me some advise, this is not the first time its happened and its going to happen again and again intill someone gets killed,

You have a right to be concerned. I wish I had some really wonderful advice for you but all I can suggest is finding another living arrangement. Is that possible? It sounds as if the staff at the facility you are in are either impotent or afraid to address the violence of the residents there. Are they medical staff or just care givers with no medical training? If there are no nurses then any medical intervention (medications) to control the aggressive and violent tendencies isn't possible. I would seriously look into other options for living. You are at risk and this is of concern. Let us know how things are going.

Everytime he throws a tantrum I clenched my teeth to suppress my anger. Just now he got into one of his tantrums again and he scratched my finger and now it won't stop bleeding. 
I sometimes just can't accept that one of my family suffer this condition. He can't act like a normal person his age. He won't eat normal foods, he'll only eat fast foods. Won't stop screaming and sometimes even hurt people, me, my parents and my little sisters.
Every time he started to scream, I feel like I want to silence him. Everyday I'll think of ways to do this. 
How to live with him? I mean, if any one of us here have similar problem with mine. How do you cope with the screaming and the wailing... I just can't take it anymore. I'm seriously considering sending him to community welfare center. Even though I'm the older brother, I just can't accept the responsibility.

286,Coping with autistic brother,"
I spent years in the third world and I never saw an autistic child. ex. In Dominican Republic, they put all the kids to play outside when they are not at school, the majority of people have not too much money,so the village do their baby sitting,they put the children to play outside in groups of children,  and I never saw a kid with autism I saw a couple with retardation but they were very active and aware of their environment. My advise to you is to talk to your parents and try to bring a lot of boys the same age or older, to play with your brother and yourself. This is going to help your brother to get rid of all attention given by your parents and close relatives and to exercise this is going to calm him down , play with him like he is normal, (because probably he is, and very smart just you guys don't know this yet)chase each other, play ball whatever of course with a supervising adult at hand probably not one of your parents will be advisable in this case. After a while I am sure your brother is going to start behaving different.  But make sure you parent are involve in this process, and the parent of the other kids, also the supervising adult should be an active young male. Be careful of  school Concelors, and Child Psychologist or child Psychiatrists, they love to put labels on children because is easier for them to deal with a child, In our days every Odd behavior is labeled Autistic. I know a case this guy was labeled autistic and  he is a genius, he has two degrees one in Physics and the other in Organic Chemistry.  When he was a child was an odd child but his parents put him to play with normal children like I suggested at the beginning and his problem was he was  too intelligent now this is just a suggestion I am just a regular person I don't have a degree in human behavior of anything like that this is just based in observations during my life and experiences.

289,Coping with autistic brother,"
I have experience, from a sibling perspective, with a brother who has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, the worst factor of this being his inability to understand when a person has become bored, and talking constantly about a certian topic, this either being football or video games. However, he does suffer from violent tempers, such as kicking me/throwing certian items at me/hitting me with certian items/bending my fingers back.
However, in terms of Autism, I have experience with an aunt and cousin, both of whom I am/was close with. With them, I grow extremely frustrated with them, but you have to understand, it is said that when they ""wail"" and such like, it is their silent screams. Both my aunt and cousin are in residential care, perhaps that is the best place for your brother, also. Think of all your options, but, also, try to put yourself in your brothers shoes, once in a while.

i have exactly the same thing.i have a little brother that is autistic and he drives me mad.but at the end of the day i think i cope just by knowing that he doent have many people on his side and that someone has to be.I am a very protective big sister to him and dont get me wrong there has been many times where i have just wanted to...not the point.but you will get through it and try your best to always reply to them and if you've had enough,then its ok just to tell someone you need a bit of a break and go lock yourself in a different room for a while. good luck and i know its hard work but there is always support

291,Coping with autistic brother,"
We have the same situation.  
And I'm terribly sorry you're going through this as well.  The overall thing that you have to remember is that it's not his fault; there's not much to do because you can't really punish him for behavior that he may not be able to control. 
They have my brother on 5 different medications and it's still not enough. 
He's screaming and wailing and repeating his usual verbals right now...a fight is definitely coming. 
Every situation is different.  And maybe a home would be best, but you have to make sure that it is best for him.  My brother gets absotlutely terrible.  I mean. Just god awful.  But he'd be miserable in a home.  And there are so many cases where autistic people are accidentely killed in institutions or homes.  Its terrible. 
As with coping, it's hard.  And seems impossible at times.. 
That's when focus on school, movies, books, and music and really anything that catches your interest comes into play.  Every little bit helps.  It's probably why I'm such a book worm! 
It really just depends on him too.  Like my brother would have a meltdown if people tried to play with him.  Just flip out.  He never used to be like that too so we've been trying to adjust to his new behaviors.  And there comes a point where you have to ""accept"" certain things.  Like we only have one car.  Well, if he doesn't get in the car and there's no one to watch him then I'm stuck at school til he does.  Or if I need to go to class and he does that....then I just don't go to class. It's incredibly irritating.  I don't see my friends...but when you can, actually having fun-definitely not doing anything stupid--can be nice, get your mind off it for a while.  He needs to eat every couple hours.  And that usually involves having to actually go out and get it...which can easily take a couple hours because we have to get him to actually say what he wants first.  I'm a trigger for him now...he can't stand seeing me when he's edgy...which is pretty much everyday, so I'm pretty much confined to my bedroom.
But again...every case is different, but you gotta analyze it and think outside the box. I know it's excruciatingly hard, but in the end...it's possible.  
Don't think irrationally. 
Trust me.
When he's choking one of us or throwing us against a wall or punching and whatever he decides to do that day...it's hard not to even yell at him.  But we can't raise our voices because that triggers him. And makes him more upset.  It's not his fault.  He doesn't understand.  Heck, I'd be mad too if I couldn't communicate.  Add that to his raging teen hormones and ya get this.
There's always a knot in my stomach. 
The cops have already come to our house because of him and I fighting one night.
But they came when we stopped.  It's always a fear because they have no idea what's going on...all they see is a 6 foot tall 250 kid slamming me into the wall....what makes you think they won't act rashly and shoot to kill?
It's been done. over. and. over. 
We have to stay sane...and do any silly thing that it is.  
There will always be support for you.  It may be hard to find.  But in something, or someone...it's out there, just waiting to say hello.
Lots and lots of help. <3

I think that is the other way around, aren't all of the autistic people putting up with you?  You should hear what they think of you actually, or should I say what they know about you, im not sure.

I know how you feel. I have an autistic sister, and though she's almost and adult, she can't speak, she can't get dressed, eat, or bathe on her own. She's about 5""6 in height, and weighs 200 pounds... so when she throws fits, it's horendous. It's hard to cope, but in order to do so, find out the things that make your brother tick. Find his triggers, and make sure you, and everyone else in the house hold tries to avoid them at all costs. If he's hurting people and what not while he's throwing the tantrums, and it becomes out of control, KEEP CALM, but restrain (without hitting) him and once he's calm, try letting him know you're not mad, but the behavior needs to stop. A lot of this stuff works for my sister, but I don't know the severity of your brother's autism, and, as every human being, each autistic person has their own personality. Try different solutions, always remain calm... maybe try finding out what he likes to do and keep him occupied with those things. Hope your situation gets better and hope you have the strength to keep doing what your doing to take care of him... your a good brother. Best of luck to ya.

I also have an autistic sibling. I don't have anyone I could turn to. My father works in another city and he lives there too. Sometimes he visits me, but we just walk out for a dinner and that's it. It hurts me also that he doesn't pay much attention to my brother, he kind of leave our family, I think that he has another woman in his city. He doesn't help us in anything, only financially, beacause of the fact that my mother can't work. He doesn't really consider it how hard our situation is. My mother on the other hand is really into my brother, she does everything about him, she often buys him a lot of toys. She is kind of stressed though I get this impression, she seems to be a very strong person, but inside her I feel like she has a lot of problems, that she can't cope with. She yells and gets angry about many unneccessary things. I can't even talk to her normally, not to hear yelling in response. 
I guess it may seem like I'm not a good, caring sister (I'm 17 and my brother is 13) , but I feel abandoned at most time and wish that my brother didn't leave with us. I just can't stop asking why me and why anything can't be normal.. I have some friends in school, but I can't bring them to my house, because I feel embarrassed. Most of my friends don't know that my brother is autistic. I don't go out anywhere with my mum and him. If only I could move my home, but I have to wait until I finished high school. 
I also feel guilty at some time, because I can't help in any way my mother, maybe because I don't want to.. I just want to have normal family. At once I felt really depressed that my father send me to psychiatrist so that he could prescribed my some antidepressants, but I know that wasn't a good way of solving out problem. 
Well, I don't require any help, but I just wanted to tell sb how I feel, I can't tell it my friends, because they would not understand, any of them is in my situation, and my mother is always yelling at me and making me feel guilty, because I don't help in anything, so I feel relieved that I am writting about my feeling here on the Internet. I haven't mentioned that my brother goes to normal primary school, but he has an individual programme. He isn't emphatetic at all. He can't very speak, he just have some learnt phrases at some situation, but he speaks like he was a robot. It is impossible to have a real conversation with him, most of the time he doesn't answer to a simple question, just when he wants to... Another fact is that he has some kind of delusions I think, he goes around the room thinking about numbers and he gets fixed and clutched, he starts yelling. When I hear all this yelling, his and my mother I just start crying and I don't know what my future here will look like. I want to start my own life in different place, but I guess it won't be easy. Please, does anyone of you feel like me ? If you have any question about my situation or whatever just ask, because I feel much better that I've just told, first time in my life how I really feel and how my situation looks like. If you have similar situation please let me know how you cope with that guilt feeling.

297,Autistic success story,"
Many years ago when we discovered our little boy had autism it was unheard of.  Had noone to talk to about it so we had to fight and claw to get him to the place he is today.  Age is the very best thing that can happen..I insisted and fought for my son to ALWAYS have one on one classes for math, spelling, reading, and speech..the very basics that we all need in life....Today Austism looks a bit different than when my son was given that label.  What makes him stand out is his monotone voice almost stacotto sounding.  He is very handsome but when he talks he is ""different""  ""special"" but we all worked with him..and he was part of that team.  Our son is special and will always be special..because a truly autistic person will always be..but here's the good news..we never gave up and this young man..just faced realtiy and moved on.  As I said we made sure he learned what he needed to live..took him to the grocery store..his teacher did..to help develope life skills..he leraned the entire bus transit schedules..OMG I don't even know what it's all about.  If the weather is bad he calls a cab.  He has a job..with absolutley no stress..on the weekends.  He has his own apartment YES HE DOES...it's just a fabulous little place but I decorated it ..it could be in a magazine..he picked out the theme.He knows to pay his bills and go to the bank  It's amazing.  He is always out and about looking at the world through his own eyes..He goes to sports bars and drinks ice tea and diet soda and watches the games..the management adores him and looks out for him..he has things planned every day...uses a cell phone and can text.  He loves to go to his synagoge on Fridays..he has made a life independely of us.  That was the plan all along..so if we pass on..and we will...he won't be lost. This is a very short look into the life of a very special young man who is and will always be ""different"" and yet somehow manages to make his self fit in and contribute.  I always say he's my hero..and he is...That's MY Story..

308,"son w/ADHD, impulsive, loner, mildly autistic or what?","
Hi, I am a newbie here, googled a question and this website popped up, so here I am.  Anyway, I have a 9 1/2 year old son, dx'd with ADHD at 5.  He also as epilepsy which was dx'd at 3 yrs.  Prior to his diagnosis he was completely out of control at school, he's always been impulsive, but he'd run away and just refuse to do what he was told.  He was put on Ritalin and became a different child, although he can still be defiant.  Every start of every new school year is a challenge although last year was not so bad once we settled.  This year has been a nightmare.  Luke is now on Ritalin and Concerta, and the Concerta has made a big difference to him.  However, we are still having problems with defiance and periods where he is not willing to do what he is told, particularly at school.  he is very impulsive, at almost 10, he is still not allowed to ride his bike down the footpath in case he shoots across the road.  Anyway, the reason I am concerned as I have had a couple of comments passed lately, like ""is he all there"" which as a mother gutted me, but I just wonder when its like 3 different people.  Luke is a very affectionate child, but is a loner and finds it difficult to socialise.  When he wants to communicate and is with someone he trusts, he sounds like a kid well beyond his years, otherwise you're lucky if you can get boo out of him.  Mornings in our household can be a nightmare, as some mornings, just getting dressed is out of the question for him.  I just wonder if maybe he has a mild form of autism or something??  Can anyone allay my fears at all!  Feel free to call me an overprotective mother!!

I am in no way diagnosing your child and can't say much because you haven't posted a lot of his symptomology. I am curious if you have looked into Aspergers? I have found that some kids who are dx with ADHD actually could be on the spectrum. It's just a thought. He may have ODD as well. I hate to throw out labels like this but I understand what its like to really feel lost and want to know what is going on with your child. I would do it soon. If he ""happens"" to have Aspergers then you would want to know. I worked with a child who was finally dx with Aspergers in middle school. He went through his elementary years being labeled a ""conduct problem."" He was just extremely misunderstood.  
What does the school say? I personally would try to find a good child clinical psychologist (Ph.D level outside of the school) to do an assessment. The school can only provide you with so much information but wouldn't be able to do a comprehensive assessment like an outside clinical psychologist could. Although I would get the school involved in the assessment. If you have insurance, they do sometimes cover assessments if you can get your doctor involved and write a referral.

I am an inclusion teacher at my school and I deal with a lot of ""spectrum kids"". Aspergers usually is diagnosed inbetween 6-9 years old. Its hard to tell because at 5 kids are egocentric and not usually wanting to share. ITs all about me me me until right before their 6th birthday and then they start to make lasting friends. Aspergers is like ADD on crack. They have lots of different symtoms like ADD and it is usually misdiagnosed with ADD.
I recently read an article about ADD and ODD. (Oppositional defiant disorder) They apparently are interlocked. You might ask your doctor or behavioralist about ODD and see if they can observe him closer. You might have to wait another few years until they find any notion to diagnose him with Aspergers. 
I also have a friend who's child has both ADD and ODD. He sounds JUST LIKE your child. At 4 he tore a hole into a door with a chair out of defiance. I dont know if its that bad for you, but I personally wouldnt have made it that far. My friend has a lot of patience for the kid.
Good luck.
Oh and usually the state in which you live can treat a child under the IDEA or 504 law (both federal laws) to test him for special education or behavior therapy. Just in case you dont have insurance. Each state is different in their ages.

I don't think you are overprotective at all. My son was diagnosed with ADHD when he was 4 at that time he had already spent two years in extensive therapies due to problems during birth. However, it was the wrong diagnosis. A year later he was diagnosed with autism. At six he is now diagnosed with a total of five disorders including autism spectrum, ADHD, anxiety disorder, communication disorder, and sensory modulation disorder. His clinical psychologist thought it was important to give him both disorders even though everything he is diagnosed with is associated with autism. Many children with autism are hyperactive, have anxiety, have problems communicating and have sensory issues. However, all diagnosis' were essential because his school had a hard time accepting the autism diagnosis.

This ADD runs in my family. My father had it, but he just died. My elder brother dropped out of high school in 9th grade because everyone thought he was the dumbest kid on the planet. My son has it too and has been on vyvanse and adderall. I was sick lately and needed some ginger which I learned to love as a child, but this is the crystalized ginger (like candy and awfully hot). I too stared out the window, could never pay attention or anything in school, but when my mother introduced me to crystalized ginger, I became an A+ student. I have one year of college and married in 1975 and had to give back 2 full-ride scholarships. I am an A+ student because I learned to love crystalized ginger. Give it a try.

317,Am I autistic?  I often have difficulty ...,"
I don't usually like things like this but I'm afraid I have no where else to turn to.
I'm 15. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger. My little brother is autistic, and I'm afraid I might be too.
At first I thought there was no way I could be autistic based on my brothers behavior, but after some research I found that girls are less often diagnosed than boys because they sometimes have different,  or somewhat less obvious, symptoms. Also I found that people with high functioning autism can live almost perfectly normal lives.
I often have difficulty forming, or keeping relationships with others (family members included), and will find myself feeling awkward around more then one person (even if they are all friends). I will miss things that are happening around me, and people have difficulty getting my attention. I have weird habits like chewing on things (headphone cords, clothes, ect.) pacing around my room or house, and carrying on conversations with myself (I've seen my brother do this as well). I have problems communicating or making eye contact with others, I sometimes mumble, and will often have trouble speaking or stutter. I also tend to talk either too loudly or too quietly, and will say things without thinking or find others laughing at something I've said without me trying to funny. In school I don't have much trouble but in recent years my grades have been much lower (though this is probably due to me being lazy and not wanting to work) , and I don't always retain what I learn (one day I'll know it perfectly and not long after I won't). 
I want to talk to my Mom about this but I'm afraid that she will dismiss it as me worrying too much, or just looking for attention (she has no faith in me sometimes). All I want is to know exactly what's wrong, whether it's autism or something else entirely. Please help.

318,Am I autistic?  I often have difficulty ...,"
I am also fifteen and at times have wondered the same thing. So I started looking around and realized something else. Sensory issues. Those are my main problems that cause all my shaking and wanting organized stuff. You may have sensory processing disorder or sensory defensiveness. I have been diagnosed with both as when I was little my parents thought I might be autistic as I did the spinning, lining things up and didn't talk or talked too much once I began talking. So you might want to look into sensory processing disorder AKA SPD

319,"A possible last resort, if I am forced onto Workfare","
A possible last resort, if I am forced onto Workfare (if this isn't the best place to post this, please move it too the relevant forum or notify me if I have to move it).
Do not advise me on any alleged ‘help for disabled/autistic/mental health’ people into work or in the workplace...I have tried it all and it is irrelevant and useless to me in particular. 
Does anyone who is autistic/asperger have any knowledge, preferably personal experience, of any legally available chemical/pill (or preferably some kind of hypnotherapy or training or some way of changing your character or at least appearing/projecting a different persona convincingly)  which will make a person more alert, process information and move/work faster, also most importantly, react quickly and aggressively (obviously nothing illegal or drastic such as the Evan Harris/Dylan Cleybold response). Assertiveness training I’ve done, but I have no idea if it will work in the work place among lots of people when I am also subject to noise, fluorescent lighting etc, lots of distractions which will push up my anxiety levels. From experience, I must not come over as weak or frightened and easily intimidated, I must react more quickly and strongly. 
Please no replies from people worried about drug reactions, I am already on SSRIs and have researched thoroughly any possible effects, short or long-term and there is no way that any reaction I have can be worse than the breakdown I had years ago, but this time I would like to be outwardly hostile if need be and react quickly to a situation, especially involving working and trying to interact with people at the same time.

Thanks for your reply, but I know there is no cure, I was simply looking for something to enable me to put a full week in.
I was looking for pills to cope at least short-term. Reason being that if I could be kept on for a full week, at least I would get a full week's pay to tide me over until I either find another place to get chucked out of or if I am lucky, crack up so spectacularly that even the employment service lets me go on benefit. That's basically what happened about 11 years ago, from what I can remember / from what I was told by people who were around me at the time.
At least there's a new rule that the coalition wants to bring in where employers can basically fire underperforming employees (as they see it) at will. I think it is called 'no fault dismissal' or something, so although it is opposed by many people, and I can see why, I suppose it could work in my interest because I might get fired before I have to get really ill. With a bit of luck, I could show an employer / HR / recruitment person my work / health history and basically tell them that I won't last very long in the job anyway before they have to let me go and hopefully they will pass me over in order to avoid the paperwork of hiring and firing.

Although the causes of autism have not been clearly identified research has suggested that chronic biochemical imbalance plays a role. However there is something I recommend looking into.

My 11 year old, very verbal, autistic son pulls on his penis constantly.  I realize that this is actually not odd for an autistic person as sensory issue but he TELLS me his penis hurts because the head rubs against the shaft and actually rolls inside from time to time.  He is not well endowed, and he is circumsized.  I'm thinking maybe there is something wrong with his circumsicion?  Is there anything I can do, or can be done to help his discomfort?  I'm afraid as he ages, this problem is going to become viewed as him being a sexual deviant.

If you get no where with the school, hire an attorney. This is a serious violation. My sons have IEP's. Never is there a meeting or discussion without my presence. That is not to say they are always compliant with the IEP and the needs of my children but they do follow the law. 
You should be given a sheet with the rights your son has within the school system and how the school must comply. Make sure you get this.
Have you been to any support group in your area? You are truly overwhelmed and need the outlet. Many parents have walked the path you are on and can guide you along the way. Google search for a support group in your area. Some support groups even have legal advisors to help parents with the more complicated issues or help when a school refuses to comply. There may be parents that can tell you how to deal with the school on your own.

340,Could 2 y/o my son be autistic?,"
Its so hard to find words for this but I'm worried about my son.
My son is 26 months old and he doesn't have a very big vocabulary. Most of the time about 95% you can't understand what hes saying, it actually sounds like a different language to me. When he does talk he only says a few words like bubba(bottle) mommy (he doesn't even know what it means half the time) Dada, daddy, papaw, Bye ne-ne ( which is just bye, he just adds the ne-ne each time), hi, and numbers. He can actually count to 10 (un, too, fee, for, fie, sis, eeven, eigh, nii, ten). My mom had him saying cookie, baby, water, and good morning but he stopped using them like he doesn't know what they mean. He loves to line up cars and cards but when he does they have to face the same way and be straight. He throws fits if someone messes them up and will throw every one of the items in the floor just to start over after hes calmed down.
When you call him name he will sometimes come to you (about 5% of the time), but most of the time you have to continuously say his name for him to even acknowledge you. When hes doin soemthing he shouldn't be if you scream at him he doesn't get scared or stop, but if you say his name low and quietly he will stop and find something else to do. Recently when he runs he has started running on his tip-toes, hes beginning to walk on his tip-toes too but not consistantly.
The reason I am wondering is he is very affectionate, very touchy feelly, and I've been told he is a very happy child. Always smiling, laughing, giggling, talking to himself, ""talking on the phone"", but thats it. He has 2 brothers ages 6 and 9 and they try to play with them but when they hug him he screams, he doesn't want them to play with his cars if they touch them he will grab them to take them away, when I give them to his brothers hes fine. Also the main way he plays is running and laughing with them and !**@! his fingers.
He is alway putting his hands on his ears like the ""hear no evil"" pose.
What do I do?

It sounds like your son may have PDD, or a Pervasive Developmental Disorder.  This is a little different from autism but has similiar symptoms, but they are different enough to be a seperate diagnosis.  The treatments are similar.. medical, environmental and educational support will help your son have the very best potential he can.  He doesn't sound too severe from what you said.. maybe everything will be just fine and he's just marching to his own beat right now.  Kudos to you for wanting to do the right thing and find out though.. so many people are in denial and it only hurts their children.  Best of luck to you.

Seeing a young child go through something like this is never an easy thing.  Iâm sorry that your son is having trouble with his speech, but it is good that his other behaviors such as listening and eye contact are more normal.  Have you ever heard of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy? Even if he doesnât have Autism, it has the potential to make a tremendous difference in his speech.  Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy is a method of treatment where your body receives oxygen at a pressurized level, flooding parts of the body with oxygen where it may not have been previously reaching.  More oxygen creates healthier cells, and healthier cells equals healthier tissues and organs!  Multiple studies have been done, with many cases showing significant signs of treatment after sessions.  Iâve also included a link to a young boy with Austism, Michael Inclan of Tampa Bay Florida.  Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy has really made a difference in his life.  Iâd love to give you more information if youâre interested.

I have some questions/concerns about my son that I believe may have Aspergers .
I’ll keep it short and I won’t go through all the details, symptoms, etc.
But I started doing a lot of reading & researching the last few weeks.
I read through so many neurological, social, childhood disorders, you name it.
I actually stumbled upon Aspergers and immediately the first thing that popped in my head was OMG.
However, some in my family think that I’m overreacting.
I read on here about other children with Asperger’s having meltdowns at school or at home.
But, we’ve never really had this kind of problem.
What my child has instead are hyperactive fits.
Sometimes he seems like a normal, energetic kid.
Other times he’s completely nonstop, over-the-top, bouncing off the wall.
And then there are times when he just kind of zones out.
I look at him and he has a blank stare.
Everyone has advice/suggestions - more discipline, etc.
I wish I could believe them, that I’m just overreacting.
However, I truly believe that it goes much deeper than that.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for your response.
Since I left this message Iâve had some time to step back and think about things more clearly.
I have learned, or at least I have come to the opinion, that every child is different and not everyoneâs situation is the same.
Well my son now has an appointment to be evaluated.
So, maybe weâll know a little more after his meeting, examination (not sure what to call it).
However, it is definitely his traits & characteristics that concern me.
His behavior can be bothersome at times but it is his daily struggles that really worry me.
He has to struggle each and every day with so many little things that are very minor to all the other kids.
Pretty helpless feeling to watch as his frustration grows in him each and every day.
So, I guess thatâs where Iâm at right now with not much else for me to do but sit and wonder and wait.

I have lived a few years with a child with asperger's. It hasn't always been easy, for the parents were in denile, and through the school councelours we finally got testing done. I wouldn't have pushed finding an answer if  My best friend didn't already have a son with autism. I have spent a lot of time with working with children with special needs and in the school system. I feel through all of my research , that this is one of the most misunderstood forms of autism. And my time with such desperate,but beautiful babies, should be brought to life. I too have experienced emence frustration, episodes you couldn't imagin,with children with asp. My biggest hardship was trying to inform a very strictly religious family, that there child needed help not dicipline, he was not trying to manipulate or disrespect on purpose b ecause they don't even understand their own emotions let alone others! My daughter is 12 and normal, it was trying for her to understand asp. And made her feel jaded. She knows autism but wasnt till We learned to be alittle different, and more understanding, that things changed. I recommend a really good book ""the aspegerger's version of the difficult child"" so it might be helpful.  I just hope that now that I moved from the family I worked for that their son is being well understood and cared for. I always think of the little ones out there that donthave a voice for themselves, and hope, one day, someone will speak up for them. Acknowledge, this is a real thing! And do right, for they shouldn't need to suffer for our ignorance. I miss you and I love you still(Never forget it Joseph!)

353,Seven Dangerous Mistakes When Dealing With Childhood AutismÃ¢�,"
The first time a parent is told that their child has Autism will be a moment that they never forget. 
Often, the moment has been preceded by months  or even years  of concern, guilt and even anger as their once happy and outgoing child becomes less communicative, less expressive and often less able to control their emotions. 
Physical comfort, such as hugs and kisses, that used to soothe your child are no longer welcomed and unusual habits and obsessions become an important part of your childs life. As a loving parent, you try everything to draw your child back out of the little world theyve created for themselves, but nothing seems to work. 
You talk to doctors, nurses, child-care specialists, positive parenting groups  anyone who can help you find the key to your childs behaviour. And finally, its confirmed: your child is diagnosed with Autism.
But, while it can be a relief to finally discover the reason for your childs difficulties  and to realize that its not your fault  a diagnosis of Autism can feel like a life sentence. Parents of children with Autism experience a wide range of emotions  confusion, resentment, maybe even guilt that they were somehow unable to protect their child from this condition. Many parents fear for their childs future and feel certain that life will never be normal or enjoyable again. 
It is vital at this difficult time in your childs life that you put aside your fears and anger so that you can realise this one important truth: you are the key to your childs future. 
Children, especially children with Autism, are vulnerable little people and they rely on you, their parents and carers, to protect them and do whats best for them. And, while you cant protect your child from Autism, you can give them the tools they so desperately need to help them to live with the condition and realise the potential thats locked up inside of them. 
BUT  to be able to help your child, you need to make sure that youre ready to work with them in the right way. 
Seven dangerous mistakes  easy to make, impossible to undo
Using her twenty years of experience, Arntzen has identified seven dangerous mistakes that parents and carers can make when they are faced with a diagnosis of Autism. These mistakes, while easy to make, can halt your childs progress or even undo the steps theyve taken so far.
Failing to accept the diagnosis
One of the most common  and natural  responses that most parents have when they learnt that their child has Autism is to go into a state of denial or shock. Many parents and carers dont really know much about Autism, and what it means for them and their child, but its important to accept the diagnosis, embrace the diagnosis and work on moving forward with that diagnosis. 
Once you accept and understand that Autism is part of your childs life  and part of who they are  you can start working with them to unlock the potential thats trapped inside them. 
Feeling guilty about your childs condition
While its natural for parents and carers to want the best for their child  and to mourn the loss of their life before Autism  its important not to let this guilt get in the way of responsible, positive parenting. 
Parents who spend their lives feeling guilty about their childs Autism  rather than accepting it as a part of who their child is  risk spoiling their child as a way of making up for the diagnosis. While parents may feel that their Autistic child needs to be wrapped up in cotton wool and protected from the world, this dangerous tendency can keep children with Autism from progressing and can even undo the steps that theyve taken towards leading their own lives.
Even though your child has Autism, it is important to raise them with structure, discipline, challenges and boundaries. Just like any other child, a child with Autism still needs to be pushed to become independent. Whether its doing their own homework, learning to feed and dress themselves or simply communicating their needs to you, your child needs to learn how to grow.
Supporting your child appropriately from the earliest possible age is crucial. Today, you can learn more about these, and the other, dangerous mistakes and learn how to avoid them. 
Remember: you are the key to your childs future.
Children with Autism need strong parents and carers who will give them love, support, boundaries and structure. While you might still be feeling shell-shocked by your childs diagnosis, its time to take action. You can start helping your child right now.
Here's a recent  news report on CNN, which reports that the number of children
with Autism in the United States is up by 78% compared to a decade ago.

Hi all, I'm wondering if you could help me if I describe some of my symptoms. I respect that I am probably not autistic but I may have Aspergers or be bi-polar.
Ok here goes. I find it very hard to speak to people. I have a few close friends but other than that around people I've known my hole life I am very awkward around. Including family. My cousin tried to talk to me and he is 14 but I could not think of anything to say, so I was awkward around him and his Grandad had to come in and intervene. I could tell he knew I was being awkward.
Even when I am with a group of people and they are talking about something I am interested in I never speak up or try to engage in their conversation. I often lie to my friends to get out of going out with them and would many times prefer to stay at home and be on my own in my bedroom.
I don't want to celebrate my birthdays. I have had one girlfriend but that was only for 2 months 8 years ago. I never really wanted to see her. We never had sex. I get nervous around new people and dread going to social events.
Sometimes I would start to get on well with a person who would become a friend. But it seems after a while I stop talking to them and start lying again to avoid seeing them.
I am 24 years old and to conquer this I decided to go travelling with a close friend I mentioned earlier. I have pretty much alienated everyone I've met while my friend went from strength to strength. I am staying at a house now where, if I here someone is in the house and I need to go to the bathroom, I will stay in my bedroom for as long as it takes for them to go away. Same if I need to cook and someone else is in the kitchen I will not go into the kitchen until they are done.
And lots more things like this but you get the picture, there is a lot going on in my life at the moment mentally and physically which I am finally starting to try and solve. I have posted about some heart trouble I've been having recently too, though I am not as urgent for info on that as I was at first, tho I am still desperate for advice.
Please, what is going on with me?

Hello wwaarrddy .. 
 
It is sad to read all the post people write on this website. I imagine somehow it must be very depressing for you been without a girlfriend for so long. When you mentioned ""We never had sex”, so are you a virgin right? Well let me tell you this. I might be an old school btw im 23 years old female but to me a guy that is a virgin at your age is nothing to feel ashamed of!!! .. I actually like the type of guy that prefers save himself for the one he loves...I feel attracted to this type of guys! And I’m sure other girls too. So stop worrying about whether a girl will like you or not. I'm positive the one for you will love you even with all the ""issues"" you explained here lol 
 
Good luck...

357,Am I Autistic? Diagnosis?,"
Yes I am but it is the other things that are bothering me. There must be something mentally wrong with me, to be so withdrawn? I don't think any girl would care for me the way I am, I don't know. Maybe I like my own time too much.
Sex has never been a massive thing for me I've never searched out for it, so to speak. I've been waiting for long enough when will a girl like me? They won't I know it.
I wonder if I should have a one night stand, maybe if I get myself so drunk I can go for it. Maybe it is all that is holding me back after all. 
I'm really at a crossroads, I don't knwo what to do. So I do nothing. I think I even shirk the attention of girls because I fear they may even grow to like me, and that's even more scary because then they will get to know me really and end up hating me anyway.

You more or less just described exactly what ails me. I'm very reclusive and withdrawn, and I find all relationships difficult and awkward. Like you, I often lie and make excuses about why I can't come out and socialize. It is simply too draining and too scary to me. People are extremely confusing and I usually miss the point of conversations. This is mostly because I can't focus very well, and partly because people make me nervous and I'm afraid they'll insult me if I speak. Even if the discussion involves something I'm interested in. Oftentimes, when I DO speak, everything is jumbled and my words do not come out as I intended them. This makes humor very hard, but still, I often amuse myself with my thoughts and I do think I'm intuitive and funny. Just misunderstood and ailed. 
My life is just one giant sequence of misinterpretations, strung together by embarrassment and anxiety. Obviously you're the same way. Like you, I avoid the people with whom I live. I sneak around so that they don't hear me, and hence I avoid painful and nerve-racking interactions. Also, I can't keep a consistent relationship and my romantic experience is pathetically shallow. I've had 2 girlfriends, one of whom I dated for 2 months, the other for 6 months. I did not have sex with either of them, and indeed I'm still a virgin. I'm 21 years old. This bothers me sometimes, but like you, I have bigger things to worry about. Confusion strangles my mind.
I'd say get help. Clearly you need it. I've had some therapy in the past, and it really did help me. Between counseling and medication, I saw some considerable emotional improvement before my second g/f broke my heart and I tried to kill myself. That was 14 months ago, and I've refused all treatment since. I guess I'm just apathetic.
By the way, I was diagnosed first with Major Depressive Disorder & Generalized Anxiety Disorder. After further counseling, they changed my diagnosis to Bipolar disorder. I was put on an anti-depressant, an anti-psychotic, ADHD-medication, and an anti-hypertensive. None of the meds worked like I hoped them to. I weaned myself off and decided to try and beat this monster naturally. It hasn't worked, so I'm probably gonna seek therapy again soon.
G'luck. I'd say you're Bipolar as well. But that's for the profs to decide.

EstrangedDaydreamer Thankyou for posting and being so honest. I am really scared to go to the Drs with this. I guess what scares me is that they'll turn around and tell me nothings wrong with me but either outcome is scary. And what do I tell my family if I am these things? I love them, but I would never want them fussing and worrying over me. I feel like I've been living a massive lie and that it will crush my parents. I'd rather go through this than subject them to that.
Did you tell your family given your diagnosis? I do not want to take drugs to solve these problems, the hardest thing is I think I want to be better but I just can't be.
I am very sorry to hear about your second girlfriend, this too is a fear. I think we both need a girl who can look after us and be patient and help us through this but me personally I am not selfish enough to force anyone to help me and bring them down aswell. It's a catch 22 situation.
Good luck with yourself, I hope therapy will help you.
Thanks again, I will work up the courage to seek professional help.

364,"rocking, violent fits of rage, screaming and throwing things","
I've been dating a woman for awhile now, I have a 3 year old son and she has a daughter that just turned 3, 2 weeks ago and a new born, a few months old. When I first meet the little girl she had fits of screaming and throwing things and hiding in the corner as if she was afraid, if I was to get up off the couch. She does the rocking back and forth regardless if shes standing, sitting watching TV or falling asleep. My son never did any of this so its all new to me. The violent fits this little girl has is no where near the fit my son has.  I've tried helping with telling her how I got my son off the bottle, potty trained and disciplining him with time out and removing toys from his room. Nothing works still, if its not her way its violent fits of rage screaming and throwing things. There is also the problem getting the little girl to sleep upstairs in her bed or her mom's, she demands to sleep on the couch with the tv on. The mother has tried baby gates, lights on nothing seems to work for this, bed time was at 11 and the little girl is still screaming and rocking back and forth at 530 in the morning. On top of the violent fit, the little girl has started pooping and peeing in her pants, I figured its all for attention but everything seem to lean toward autism to me. I've researched autism  and other things that could cause kids to act like she does. I though she might have the level 4 autism maybe, she can speak and communicate her vocabulary is very poor, for her age and the mother refuses to have the girl check for anything.  I just dont know what to do to help.

does anyone know more about a genetic disorder that affects the whole body of a child, stopping him from growing , but allows his internal organs to grow normally ?
i met such a child in a center focused on helping children with autism and i would like to know more about that, if anyone can provide me some information.
i would like to know the full name and effects of that disorder and the treatment, if there is any.
  
all i know yet is that his internal organs are compressed into his small body (which seems to have stopped growing) and it looks like he is ready to explode.
all his physical activities are reduced due to that problem.
i heard he took a treatment based on hormones to make his body grow, but it wasn't very effective.
  
i appreciate any kind help

366,rare genetic disorder :: unknown ?,"
""Suffering is a journey which has an end""
Autism is a neurological developmental disorder that effects children ability to socialize and normally impairfs language behavioral abnormalities. Most cases are diagnosed before three years of age, and there has been an alarming increase in the number of cases diagnosed over the past 18 years.  According to the most recent estimates by the Center for Disease Control, about one in 150 cildren in the U.S. suffers from an autistic disorder.  Boys are more likely candidates than girls of having autism.  To date, medical treatment of this disorder has been minimally effective.
Although the causes of autism have not been clearly identified research has suggested that chronic biochemical imbalance plays a role.  However, some autism studies have found a distinctive link with people diagnosed with autism and an unusually high heavy metal content in their blood, especially mercury and lead.  The body's ability to defuse or expunge certain metals causes a high concentration of these metals that seems to block certain social solving skills in the brain.  
Retention of these heavy metals i the body creates a severe imbalance in the ratio of active to inactive glutathione, the body's most important tool for detoxifying and excreting metals.  Studies have shown that levels of the majjor intracellular antioxidant, glutathione, is typically about 48 percent lower in children with autism.  Dr. Janet Kern, and adjunct assistant professor of psychiatry at Utah Southwestern, states, ""Some children with autism are poor detoxifiers relative to normally developing children, and in particular have trouble excreting toxic metals.  Toxic metals that are not eliminated may build up in the brain.  Glutathione has been found to be lower in children with autism, particularly, in children with autism who have regressed.  We want to clearly establish that raising glutathione levels in these children will improve their ability to detoxify these substances and in that way improve some of their symptoms.""
So how do these heavy metals get into the body? One very elusive method that we hear about is through vaccines. The preservative thimerosal, which was used in some vaccines, was found to have adverse affects that accounted for some of the heavy metal build up.  Thimerosal is now also bieing blamed for Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) that affects milllions of children and their families.
Our food supply is also a big contributor of heavy metals. Fish and shellfish can contain high levels of mercury. Women who are of child bearing age are warned to avoid these foods it they are anticipating pregnancy. Green leafy plants canretain levels of leald fromt he soil. The intake is not as much as is the prblem of releasing these heavy metals. If a person cannot relase these metals then the build-up appears to casue or at least contribute to the symptoms of autism.
Electrolytes and mineral deficiencies can also contribute to autism. Tonic and crystalloid minerals have the ability to attrack heavy metals and carry them from the body. Electrolyte forming minerals also improve neurotransmitting function in the brain, allowing the potential for restoring normalcy.
Zeolite is another specialty supplemnent that should be considered if you are trying to detox and remove heavy metals from the body. Zeolite is a natural extremely hard, microporous, honeycomb structure laced with electrically charged ducts and cavities throughout that are electrically charged. 
This charge works to attract positive minerals such as calcium and magnesium that can easily be displaced by heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury, nickel and arsenic, and thus they can be removed from the body. What is interesting is tha zeolite appears to remove toxins in a certain order. It first removes heavy metals within the first few weeks of use, then it removes secondary priority toxins including pesticides, herbicides and plastics. Zeolite also acts as an antioxidant by trapping free radicals inits complex structure, inactivating and eliminating them.

367,very strange behavior,"
Ever since early childhood my brother and I have had a behavior no one can seem to explain; 
we sort of delve into our own minds and lose focus on the world around us, and live within our minds, thinking of and focusing completely on a story or just anything we find fascinating in our imagination.  while this is going on, I take a plastic straw with both hands and walk around sort of wiggling it.  My brother flails his hands, !**@! and shaking them.  He tends to add sound effects to whatever is going on in his head, and we both make facial expressions.  This can go on for hours at a time.  I am 18 and he is 15.  This is basically our big strange secret that we only share with our immediate family, because outside of this behavior we are completely average teens that do normal everyday things and have normal social interactions.  I just want to know what  is going on. Anyone have answers?

What is normal, a fabricated word, that is all that it is, and the word normal and invested so much energy into what you imagine it to be is very crazy to me.
If it isn't causing problems, then it is okay, and it doesn't matter at all how wierd anyone including ourselves think that it is.
so you sit there all that you want and take your journeys together and do whatever you wish even if it might seem strange.  Just don't cause any problems.

373,Multi-Fascited Problem no diagnosis to show disability,"
I apologize that this is not solely an autism question but it is largely envolving it. I exibit many symptoms of either Aspergers or High Functioning Autism but I do not have a problem with those, in fact I enjoy that part of my being, however, due to them I have found other things have developed. Because I could not function completely in society I was regularly beaten by other children at a young age. At 9 I started being beaten and isolated by my step mother for several years. After that of course came the bullying of high school. After that I was hit by a drunk driver almost dying and losing function of my right leg and left ear. I think there may have been neurological damage because of it as well but I cant say for sure. After I recovered from that I took on 10 years of high stress jobs (technical support for overdemanding companies) that threatened me repeatedly. Now I am unemployed for over a year and because I have had a chance to think I have found myself repeatedly breaking down over and over again almost nightly. I am afraid of everything and daily become more and more introverted. I am running out of unemployment and I cant work like this. I have no insurance and no recourse. I am running out of options and have no diagnosis to show disability in this capacity. I may be able to get disability for my leg (maybe) but I need help badly and can't find a way out. If I don't find something I will be homeless which I am afraid will drive me even further into my emotional hole. Any thoughs would be helpful.

My son is treated with nothing but respect and love by everyone, he was a cheeky little chap who could elicit a smile from everyine he met until his development started regressing.
No one that he comes into contact with treats him any different since he has had these changed and I resent the implication otherwise.
I agree Music is a brilliant therapy which is why I have always played music in various genre's every day for my 3 children.
And last but not least how dare you imply I treat my child with anything less than love and respect. My children, each and every one of them are my life and I would not stand for anyone treating them in this manner.
Dont judge other people until you have walked a mile in their footsteps, I think this is a saying you could learn a lot from!

381,Possible Asperger's Diagnosis.,"
I don't actually know where to begin with this, so I'll start from the beginning . My now 18 year old daughter has always been the odd one out in the family. It started when she was a baby, she constantly cried and she only wanted me. The doctor's told me that she was just spoiled and most infants prefer one parent over the other. When she was four, I noticed she continously rocked alot and moved alot, and talked very loudly, in which her even the teachers noticed  how loud she was. The doctor's told me she was just very hyper. Then came the social skills. Sure  she had conversations with people, but she could never keep a friend and never made eye contact with anyone. In fact, her first three best friends weren't until middleschool, however, all three are boys and one of the boys has ADHD and the other two  (twins, one of the twins are now her boyfriend) had various degrees of autism (her boyfriend has aspergers, while the other twin has autism, just not severe). Educationally wise, she has always been exceptionally smart (her weakness is math) is taught her self how to read music notation and playing the piano based off of connecting one instrument music notation to the other. She never really had any girl friends, until the ninth grade, however, the friendship terminated in the 12th grade in she was really sad about and blamed herself, exclaiming ""It was because I was always pessimistic and didn't know what to say about certain *girlie* things"". She does go to the movies and hangs out occasionally with close friends,and spends alot of time with her boyfriend ( one of the twins mentioned earlier) yet loud noises still frighten her, especially fireworks. I brought it up to her pediatrician when she was seventeen, and the only think the pediatrician said was ""Is she three years old? Does she engage with others? Then she doesn't have it"". I thought it was an ignorant thing to say, especially with the various degrees of autism not to mention the girls carry different characteristics then boys do. I still worry for her sake. One moment, she acts like a perfectly normal teenager then the next she's crying on her desk in frustration when she can't pursue something of her interest. She's constantly distracted yet she loves facts, comic books, and music. She once told me herself ""Mom, my mind feels continuously cluttered"" and ""I feel so different from the rest of my peers. I try and try and try, but I feel like it's never enough"". It breaks my heart to hear her say this. I've done my homework, and I feel she meets the criteria for Asperger's syndrome/ADHD. My question is this: Where do I begin to get her diagnosed? She just turned eighteen in November and enrolled in a community college. If her pediatrician will not  do much if not anything for her, how can I go about this myself?

382,Possible Asperger's Diagnosis.,"
Run - don't walk - to get her a neuropsych evaluation.  Our son had similar multiple ""behavior"" issues from an early age.  Didn't get him diagnosed until he was 15 years old & after years of cognitive behavior therapy & his developing a major depressive disorder (which we attribute to all the years of ""floundering"" emotionally).  His depression part got so bad I broke down to his last psychiatrist & he finally asked - ""Have you ever had a neuropsych evaluation done?""...I was like, huh?  From that point on, the light bulbs have been turning on as far as a true understanding of our son.
The evaluations aren't cheap - it cost us $2K up front, but we battled it out with our insurance and was able to recoup most of it.  It was well worth it.  There is no limit to what age you can be evaluated & it's never too late to get help.  With proper guidance and therapy, she can gain better insight into how her own mind works (which, by the way *is* different for aspies), appreciate her own strengths and develop coping skills and strategies for those things that are more difficult.
Good luck to you.

388,What if he has autism?!,"
My almost 4 year old son is way behind in his communication skills. He doesn't understand hardly anything we ask him, ""what do you want to eat?"" or ""what do you want to do today?"". For many things he simply repeats what you have asked in his own jargon with a few words that we understand mixed in. He will be getting speech therapy within the next month but I am so afraid that he is going to become autistic. I know you aren't supposed to google things because it will only scare you but some of the symptoms are there for autism. He is so very loving and affectionate and I am terrified that maybe this is just the beginning of autism and that one day I'll wake up and he won't be the same loving little boy that he is now. 
I feel like I am missing out on so many things with my son though. I have an older child who is 11 and she was completely different than my son. She started talking at 5 months. So with her I got to know her and her likes and dislikes. I got to tell her stories about the tooth fairy and Santa Claus and the Easter bunny. I also felt a little more secure knowing that she knew my first and last name, her first and last name, her phone number, her address and stuff like that. My son only knows his first name. When he talks it sounds like a bunch of random babbles with a few English words mixed in. 
I am so stressed out over all this. I feel horrible saying this but I don't like to take my son out in public because he doesn't listen at all. He won't eat hardly anything except chicken nuggets and bananas. He won't sit down to eat and he refuses to pick up his own food like when he occasionally eats pizza. 
Can he really be caught up with his peers in time for kindergarten? Will he have a tough time in school? Will I ever really get to tall to my child!?

Ok here we go, my son will be 3 in May. He is hitting all of his milestones normally, but he doesn't like to play with kids his age or younger, when he does he has problems getting along with them. He is very sensitive to sunlight, doesnt even like it when I open the curtains, so they usually stay closed. He is very sensitive to sounds as well, doesn't like the vacuum, or any kids being loud. He will only eat certain foods, but would rather milk. He does not like change, like he wants nothing to do with potty training, or sleeping in his own bed, when we leave the apartment there are 2 sets of stairs and he only wants to go the one way and if i make him go down the other way he gets very upset. He gets very bad tantrums, doesn't like his hands dirty.  The only people he really is close to is my husband, my mother and myself.  He doesn't really like anyone else talking to him.  Will not wear jeans at all only comfy pants, these are some of the things that I can think of right now.  I just mentioned it to my mom today and she told me that her and my sister thought that of him but were afraid to say anything to me about it.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you and forgot to say that he would rather play on his own then with anyone.

Have you looked into any social skills classes? Around here, we have organizations that camps during the summer and classes and stuff for kids who have aspergers, where they just work on social skills. 
As far as you, you will have to be very frank and explain to him proper ways of interacting with others. Tell him, ""Don't say that, because when you say that, other people's feelings get hurt and they won't want to be your friend"" or something like that. You need to tell him, because it doesn't come natrually to him like it does to you.  
Plus, even if he's in regular classes, there should still be some form of support for him. I'd talk to the school admin/psychologist about it all and see what your options are.

Hi there, my son was diagnosed with autism when he was 3. He's 7 now and in year2 but I'm finding that even though his reports from nursery were followed on to his school it seems that the school take no notice of his condition. I had one teacher in a parents evening ask me ""what exactly is wrong with him"". I spoke to the school Senco after this who told me that the teacher had looked at my sons file ONCE (which would of noted that he was autistic and had notes from the nursery with things the school could do to help him in his learning and behaviour) and i wasn't surprised after hearing this that she had no clue in what to do in order to help my son achieve to his best ability because that teacher also had 17 other children's files to read. It had taken me 2 years to get my son diagnosed, leaving me with no trust in the medical field, but i cant lose hope with the education sector. What they don't understand is, if my son has a bad day at school, he wont show it until he gets home and i take the full brunt of all the anger, bitterness and unfair treatment he's held inside himself all day. He bangs his head on walls, cry's non stop for hours, break things until i find out what happened at school and it can be as little as him being told off (in the morning) and not FULLY understanding why. When i have spoken to them in the past they just don't seem to understand what I'm saying because for some reason he doesn't show this behaviour.  How can i get them to understand and take me seriously

I'm aspy myself and I survived school. Dont get me wrong I wasn't the most popular kid but one of the most amusing parts of being aspy is u dont realise wen ur insulting people and u dont realise wen they are pissed off at u, so it doesnt bother u so much.
But seriously, I never really fit in with anyone, but i had a few good friends who just found my quirks funny. And now as an adult the best friends I have in the world get it and they find it endearing (they also pre warn anyone they introduce me to that I mean no offence when I say something stupid). And also as an adult my husband loves my in your face bluntness, he loves my retarded honesty (as he calls it) - it is one of the reasons we have such a great relationship - cause I am so honest with him with things that most women would never dare say to their husbands.
So in short what I'm saying is your child will survive high school, probably wont be mr popular, but on the other end may end up a very successful and happy adult anyway

Is your not son not recieving any help within lessons? I have a brother with Asperger's Syndrome, and he has an assitant that aids him in his work during class, and is currently in the process of having someone aid him in social interaction with his peers, also. You need to talk to the school in terms of assistance in lessons/social interaction. It is not fair on your son to allow him to struggle in a social enviroment/lessons on his own, my brother was ""asked"" to leave his previous school due to being left in that same situation.

This can be a very difficult time - especially since your son is at the age where he will encounter many different social situations.  I know it is also hard to put him into a regular education class right now.  I can understand your fears.
Have you ever heard of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy?  It is a non-invasive form of therapy that hast he potential to improve you sonâs social interactions.  In a Hyperbaric Chamber session, atmospheric pressure along with an abundance of oxygen causes the body to flood with oxygen - even places it may have had trouble reaching before.  This creates healthier cells, and healthier cells equals healthier tissues and organs.  Multiple sessions have shown significant signs of improvement in many cases.  Iâve included several links on Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, including a video of a boy with Autism. Just let me know if you need any more information.

protector33, yes, I did vow ""for better or worse,"" and ""in sickness and in health"" and did my best for seven tortuous years after she got sick. By the time I hit the end of the rope it was either suicide or divorce. And since I have a disabled daughter who needs at least one healthy parent, divorce was the only option. Guilt was something I suffered from for a few months until I realized we'd be happier (both of us) apart. (which we are, now.) And financially more stable, since medicaid/medicare pays for everything for my ex wife. She was spending money so irresponsibly and so QUICKLY that we'd be destitute had we stayed together. Now all her finances are managed for her and my daughter and I are financially stable again, looking toward the future.

Her temper is quick to react and about as unloving as you can find.  I understand I've searched hundreds of websites to try and find answers.

415,Link between low levels of Glutathione and Autism,"
Hi,
I've been doing a lot of research on the link between autism and glutathione. It has been found that children with autism have lower levels of glutathione than children without autism. Also, children who have gotten IV glutathione get better!
Here is an article I wrote on the subject. 
When Autism strikes a family it is normal to seek out whatever help is available to assist the child in growing and developing as well as he or she possibly can. Over the years there have been various different treatments and therapies, each with their own degree of success. It has only been in more recent years though that the antioxidant, glutathione, has been brought up as a possible treatment to assist children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
So is there any truth to the stories and information out there about Glutathione and its effect on autism? There are documented case studies of multiple children with autism spectrum disorders who after a few treatments with Glutathione showed profound improvement. They became less combative, calmer and more cooperative. Some of the children were able to speak for the very first time in their lives. One mother reports that, after 4 glutathione treatments, her eight-year-old son was able to dress himself for the first time ever. 
Glutathione is known as the master antioxidant and is, in fact, the most prevalent and powerful of all antioxidants in the human body. All other antioxidants, including vitamins A, C and E, require the correct levels of glutathione in order to perform their tasks within the body properly. Every cell in the body requires glutathione to function as they were created, but when glutathione levels are low or depleted, then they become vulnerable to damage by free radicals and oxidative stress. The brain is especially susceptible to oxidative stress and damage by free radicals. When healthy levels of glutathione are maintained then oxidative stress and its implications are greatly reduced. Hence the importance of maintaining the correct levels of this important antioxidant at all times.
Often blood tests from children with autism show a low level of glutathione. This means that oxidative stress is likely to be causing further damage to cells within the body, especially the brain, and also that toxin levels within the body will be higher than they should be. Both of these situations are improved greatly by increasing the glutathione levels in the body.
When a child is treated with glutathione their levels of this antioxidant greatly increase, thus assisting the body in fighting off the free radicals and reducing the impact of oxidative stress. The effect is holistic in that the glutathione works in three different ways: to detoxify the body, at a cell level; enhance and strengthen the immune system and act as an antioxidant to protect the body from the dangerous effects of oxidative stress. It is important to remember that this is not a cure, but rather a treatment that is helping many families that have a child with ASD.
Each case is individual and the results for each child are unique, but the improvements in many of the autistic children receiving glutathione treatments are truly promising. Parents are able to hear their child speak and see them interacting with others, which was certainly not the case before their glutathione interventions. It is also important to have a holistic view of autism and to ensure a healthy diet that reduces the effects of ASD. Behavioral coaching may also be something that benefits the child. When the combination of diet, behavioral intervention and glutathione treatments are combined then it definitely appears, from documented cases, that there may be drastic improvements in the child's socialization skills, interaction and verbalization.

Maybe it is the 5 year old boy trying to come out or it may be adhd, or both.   He is under the care of a pediatric neurologist right now, but the doctor has not been much help.   I am also looking for answers and for someone to ""talk"" to.

The pediatric neurologist that is treating my son did order blood tests.   He did not say why(i think).   I decided not to bring my son for this.   I know he will not sit still for this and it will be very upsetting for the both of us.   That phone number you mentioned.   I would like to try it.   Have you tried any meds or a special diet with your son?   I have tried both with little difference in his behavior.   How is your son with haircuts?   We have tried different ways with no luck.   I hope my experiences don't discourage you.   I have heard of some success stories, so I am trying to continue to be hopeful.   
Take care.

My little boy is autistic.  I kow and relate to what you have said, I have reached the point where I am no longer willing to go to the doctor and pay for them to guess and blow me off.
Just this week I went to see an allergist, but have to go to the hospital for the blood draw.  (to see about dairy or gluten allergies) I think my next step should be with a neurologist.  I only have begun to accept my son's autism from the evaluations at school.  Now I need to start with the medical, and see perhaps if I can get any more specific information about him.
Do any of you have any advice for me as where to start, other than what I have mentioned?  I cancelled my insurance because I was afraid he was being treated based on what the insurance would pay, but I often feel like they are all just getting an office fee from me, I have yet to feel like I accomplished anything more than writing them a check.......

I have a dd soon to be 3, she was a preemie born at 26 weeks gestation.   She has had many issues in her little life and has overcome many of them.   We now suspect she may be autistic.   She has frequent violent tantrums where she becomes quite agressive and inflicts pain on herself and us, she is speech delayed(18 month age level), she isn't potty trained and doesnt look like its in the cards anytime soon as she could care less if she is soiled and in fact fights diaper changes.  She is busy alllllll the time, ignores everyone around her unless she needs something once she gets it shes back to her own world again, has been in preschool a month and has nothing to do with the other kids.   This is just hitting on a few of the issues there are many more that I won't drag on about here.   I have had issues over the last 3 years with getting the doctors to listen to me and i'm fully expecting this to happen again, my mommy instinct is telling me something is wrong with my kid and it isn't wrong very often.   We ignored these behaviors all this time figuring its the terrible twos but when you put all the little pieces together it looks like a big something.   My question is did anyone else have any problems making the doctors listen and what worked for you also what does the testing entail?   I'm supposed to call the developmental pediatrician next week to make an appointment for having testing done.

As my husband posted back in april, our 4.5 year old daughter, tori, was born with down syndrome and was diagnosed earlier this year with autism.   From all my research and personal experience...Observation of a child is the best diagnosis.   There are ""behaviors"" typical of asd (autistic spectrum disorder) and no 2 children are the same in these behaviors.   The spectrum is very broad.   I picked up on alot of tori's behaviors unusual for a child with down syndrome for quite some time and monitored them and finally decided to have a psychological evaluation done on her.   Low and behold, mom was right (not that I wanted to be this time).   Tori has alot of sensory issues and has gotten more agressive.   Her sleep was way off for months, and things just kept piling up.   She now receives 25+ hours behavioral health rehabilitative services and is improving slowly.   Kennedy krieger institute in baltimore is very big on autism and Dr.  George capone is apparently brilliant.   We have not yet had the opportunity to meet with him, but have read alot of his research and have spoken with reps from there and they seem to have a clue.   I love my little one to death, but as a parent of a child with special needs, now with a dual diagnosis, I would rather have 15 kids with ds than 1 with asd.   It is a very challenging disorder and has no reasoning behind it.   At least with the ds, we know what she has- an extra 21st chromosone and an attitude.

Umm I don't think so. I doubt it will help your MS at all, probably cost a ton of money and you can do serious damage to your body in one of those chambers.
So far the best results I have heard about from alternative therapy were with acupuncture. I have not tried it myself but if you want to spend money on something thats where I would look first.
A couple of small but promising studies have been done with Omega 3's so you might want to look there as well.
I hate to say it since I am a big fan of alternative's myself but I have found very little in the way of successful alternatives for MS.

MS also causes swelling and edema which leads to a reduction of effective oxygen being delivered to the nerve tissues, resulting in a variety of widespread symptoms.
Drug therapies for multiple sclerosis can cause significant side effects, which may feel worse than the discomforts they are designed to relieve. A number of different drugs are used in MS therapy, including interferon and various steroids. These drugs not only cause a wide variety of side effects, but are also extremely expensive.  The average cost of managing an MS patient in the USA with drug therapies is reported to be more than US$25,000 per year (Neubauer 1988). 
Dr Phillip James MB ChB, DIH, PhD, FFOM, Wolfson Hyperbaric Medicine Unit (1999), performed during the past 13 years specifically for MS patients to over 1.2 million chamber sessions. 
Oxygen Medicine with Hyperbaric is currently one of the best treatments that offer the MS patient some form of relief from the clinical symptoms without serious side effects. Unlike most of the other therapies, Oxygen therapy is the only drug-like treatment that has been shown to work on a continuing basis. In addition, HBOT has been the therapy used on the largest number of patients for the longest period of time, which means that it is the therapy with the longest period of follow-up results.
'The object of giving a concentrated dose of Oxygen is to restore the level of Oxygen in the affected area to normal and interrupt the progression to scar formation. Oxygen is necessary, not only for all metabolism, but also for the regulation of many aspects of blood vessel and blood cell function. The blood-brain barrier requires energy and oxygen to maintain its integrity. Giving more Oxygen in fact constricts the diameter of blood vessels and yet paradoxically improves the transport of Oxygen to the tissues. Oxygen also modulates the behaviour of white blood cells and the inner lining of the vessels'.
However Hyperbaric Medicine is very expensive. Up to $250 per session and it has lots of side effect like creation of free radicals. Over the last 30 years, over 6,000 scientific studies have revealed that free radical activity represents a major cause of all degenerative diseases.
There is an advanced oxygen therapy called Energized O2 therapy used more and more by doctors, naturopaths in France, Spain, Japan, UK, Finland, etc... 
EnergizedO2 technology uses one of natureâs processes which have existed for millions of years, e.g. photosynthesis in green leaves. This ensures that oxygen is activated in a way which your body understands. 
In nature, energy from our sun activates chlorophyll in plant leaves and acts as a catalyst to transform the oxygen produced by a plant to a higher-energy status.
Nobel-winning biochemist Albert Szent-Gyorgyi called it âa little electric charge set up by the sunshine.â 
Oxygen has various properties: the oxygen present in respiratory air is not reactive. In order to make the oxygen utilisable for producing energy in the body, the body must first bring the oxygen into its reactive state. However, as the bodyâs ability to use the oxygen diminishes with increasing age, through stress, illness and environmental toxins, etc...
EnergizedO2 helps the body to increase its use of oxygen in a natural way.
In the EnergizedO2 device the airâs oxygen is continually returned to its high energy state which is the physiologically active form of the oxygen that the body is familiar with. 
In the organism the â EnergizedO2 energyâ noticeably improves the way the oxygen is used and has a positive effect on many of the bodyâs functions - without an additional supply of oxygen and without foreign substances.
EnergizedO2 system is very affordable and easy to use system I would recommend. It allows to constantly increase energy-rich oxygen level in the blood and tissues allowing the body to expel toxins, heavy metals, suppress free radicals, get rid of pain, etc.

M.S. is autoimmune where the body attacks its own tubulin/myelin, etc. right? One thing I've learned being involved in supporting autism research is that autism is also partly auto-immune in nature. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been emerging in the autism world as a beneficial therapy. 
some video interviews on the subject: http://www.autismmedia.org/media13.html
I believe autism has both toxicological and viral triggers. I believe M.S. does, too.
While they haven't found a virus associated with M.S.... they do find viral titers in the spinal fluid. Same can be said for autism... but the titers for autism are often associated with the measles virus. (often the MMR vaccine strain... as gut biopsies are showing)
Many autistics have high levels of heavy metals in their bodies... mercury, lead, aluminum... and the inability to excrete these metals due to poor methylation, etc. Chelation therapy has resulted in more dramatic improvements in autistic symptoms than any other therapy. I also happen to know that folks with M.S. (who are tested for heavy metals... via urinary porphyrins, fecal metals and hair metals) often are very high in metals. When treated for metal intoxication with chelation therapy... dramatic recoveries have been documented.
Watch  interview, here:

Toward the end of the interview, she talks about treating an M.S. patient with chelation...

Jessica, Iâm so sorry to hear that you have Multiple Sclerosis.  Your life is affected in all areas - and itâs never easy to adjust.  Iâm glad youâre exploring the possibility of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy - I think it could really help not only with your symptoms, but also in improving the quality of your daily life.  Joey is right - MS also causes swelling and edema which leads to a reduction of effective oxygen being delivered to the nerve tissues, resulting in a variety of widespread symptoms.  Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy is the method of delivering oxygen to your body at a cellular level.  This allows the oxygen to reach all areas of your body much more effectively than itâs normally able to.  More oxygen to the cells creates healthier cells, which in turn creates healthier tissues and organs.  Not only can HBOT really some of the swelling and inflammation, but increased oxygen to your body and your brain can make a huge difference in your energy and activity levels.  I encourage you to continue looking into Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.  It could really make a difference in your life.  
Iâve included a link to a video of how Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy has made a difference - in the life of a small boy with autism, recovery from bladder surgery, and in the life of a young boy with cancer.  Iâve also included some links on HBOT - please donât hesitate to contact me if you need any more information.

That is a terrible thing for a mother to say and I am sorry that you have to go through that. You can be anything that you set your mind to be.

People with asperger syndrome can live a relatively normal life there are doctors and lawyers who have asperger syndrome.

Catonia- nice to see you around here again 
Sometimes AS can make people seem dependent. Are you getting any kind of support- therapy, treatment of any kind? If being dependent at certain things bothers you, there are therapies/treatments that can help you become more independent.  There are even physical therapies aimed directly at helping people with AS walk and play more normally. 
It's important to remember that AS does not intellectually impair you. It may make some aspects of life more challenging, but you have all the same potential as anyone else. 
You can improve the aspects that are difficult right now- ask for help!

I think you look pretty! And I'm not just saying that.
Sometimes, well, most of the time, kids will pick up on small differences in the way you act (for kids with aspergers, that usually means small differences in the way you interact with other people)
the kids can't quite put their finger on what is different about you, so they make fun of something easy, like the way you look. (Who isn't self-conscious about how they look?) 
Does that make sense? My little brother is the same way- -he's quite good looking, but gets made fun of because he acts a little differently than most kids, even if it's not really obvious.

Hi,
Don't despair
All of us with AS are different. I am 44 yrs old with it, and my 18yr old son had it too. I have dyspraxia also, but thanks to 10 yrs of martial arts, I'm a black belt who teaches kids with AS or coordination issues. My advice to you, is have your mum get you involved in an activity that helps with coordination, I promise it will help. The other stuff, you will learn to cope as time goes on.  You will always be different, so what.... variety is the spice of life. There are more people out there waiting to support you than cut you down. Stay away from those who don't accept you. Your mother is just frustrated, becuase she sees you hurting and doesn't know how to stop it. I know, I've been there with Myles, my son. 
I will say a prayer for you tonight.

I've heard that people with different forms of autism can do some awesome things.  I don't know much about it though.  A woman on the radio, on the coast to coast show, said that some of them can talk to animals and that they are visited by otherworldly beings.  Ever had that happen?  Look that particular show up online somehow, I believe it will be interesting for you, even make you (dare I say it!?) smile.  I think that you can look up particular shows that they have done, so look up the interview about the autism, it's call coast to coast, it was an excellent show, although they do make mistakes.
You should be honored that they don't like you, every negative thing that they say about you, even about eachother, is actually a compliment, because they are mongrels, little tiny minded know nothings, greedy, selfish, delusional.  And all that they want to do is extinguish your light, and make you like them, because they are nothing and they know it.  Like some kind've subconscious jealousy.  But it is a compliment if they don't want you, it's a compliment if they hate you, that's only an oppurtunity to be free, not assimalate and learn what you need to be happy, which is the opposite of what they are doing actually, which is only what they are told.
There isn't anything wrong with the way that you look, you've got a christina ricci thing going, but thats only looks,  it would be strange to say that certain shapes and colors looked good while others didn't, only looks.  I'm more concerned about what we are actually, not how we look.  But oh well.
Have trouble socializing do you?  That's amazing to me actually, and I think that it's a good thing, be careful whom you pick as ""friends"", that's what they call them right?  ""friends"".  Life is to messed up to socialize in my opinion.  And talk to eachother about the game, or the new clothes that just came out.  I mean, how blind are they?  Surely they can see something, anything?  Unless you call socializing fixing the world's problems.
In my opinion a mother that idiotic and cruel should be smacked in her stupid freaking face, Im sick of living with these apes and something like that deserves a good smack in your little ugly mouth, for lack of a better word What a d#$n b#$ch!  And that would be the loving thing to do in my opinion, just smack her, maybe it would teach her how to not be stupid, because words aren't helping.
And like I tell everyone else, hey, at least you aren't schizophrenic right.?

She also said that she had noted that some of the children could talk to animals also.

495,I'm worried I might be Autistic...,"
I'm fifteen years old, and I'm very worried I might be Autistic. In social situations I'm usually very... awkward, I can rarely bring myself to talk even if I want to, even if I'm with very close friends (I can talk fine one on one, but when it's me and two or more people I'm extremely and randomly nervous). I also can't keep eye contact for very long- it sounds weird, but if I have to look into someones eyes for more than a few seconds I suddenly flinch away (this happens with everyone but one person, who is the closest non-family member to me).
I also have a habit of organizing my friends possessions (say, video game cases, or books and D.V.D's) into some form of order, and on my computer, I have to organize everything into specific folders, whether it be music or pictures or general documents. 
I spoke to my doctor about it, but he just said ""Well you could be, but you've 'missed the boat' with this kind of thing- What good would knowing you're autistic be now?"" and he is reluctant to get me tested for it and such.
Oh, and, also, sometimes, if something has an odd shape I love to touch it. I would sit there for half a minute just pushing my thumb around an odd shape (say a dent in something, or... like the kind of shape a spoon is).
Perhaps my doctor is right, and knowing that I'm autistic now (at fifteen) won't help me at all, but still, I'd rather know than not know. 
Can anyone give me any insight? I do have one Autistic friend, and one friend with Aspergus syndrome, however, I'm afraid to ask my Autistic friend as sometimes when I bring up a possible condition I may have she says I'm just being offensive to people who have it... and I cannot ask my Aspergus friend as he is at University right now, and I am also to nervous to ask.

In all honesty, nobody could possibly diagnose you with something like Autism this way, however in my opinion, given what you have described, it sounds like you are a teenager.  All teens go through this kind of stuff, I did too.  What you described, however weird they may seem right now, are just teenage type behaviors and feelings.  I had many of the same too and I don't have Autism or Aspergers.  Eventually you work it all out and it everything becomes ok.  There are teen hormones at work here too. 
Nothing you described points to Autism or Asperger's, in my opinion. Instead, perhaps you are a more sensitive person.  You seem to be more in touch with your feelings than the average 15 year old. You are obviously very smart to think about things to this extent at your age.  You're a thinker.  You are exploring possibilities and seeking answers.  These are some of the gifts you bring to the world to make it a better place, you just need to figure out how you will use them.  Figuring it out will take a few years, that's totally normal.  It's like that for everyone.  
Don't be hard on yourself.  Even if you think you're different, I don't really know that you are.  In general terms, don't try to label yourself.  Give yourself the freedom to be who you are and love yourself for it.   You'd be surprised to find out that many of your peers have similar experiences and are going through some of the same things too.  Even so, you are the only you there will ever be!  You'll get past all of this soon enough, and when you do you'll be a better adult for it.

As a previous poster said, can't really diagnose from a post....however, I always think that knowledge is power.  My 8 year old has Aspergers.  When he was 3 my sister-in-law suggested we get him checked.  My husband and I thought ""He's just a little kid, and all little kids are weird, aren't they"".  But we decided to do due diligence.  Our family doctor gave us the same line yours gave you...but about a 3 year old ""what good will it do to know"".  Well, knowing allowed us to get educated.  Knowing allowed us to get funding from our government (in Canada) to help our son out.  Having a diagnosis allowed the school system to provide extra support in the social area for him.  We've been able to read about ways to help him.  He's old enough now that we read about Aspergers together and understand about his strengths, and his weaknesses, and work on them together.  It was really hard to get the diagnosis at first.  But as we put it, everyone has their own set of issues and oddities, whether they have a label or not.  I don't know if your healthcare covers stuff like an occupational therapist or a speech language pathologist, but these people can be fabulous resources for high functioning autism/aspergers.   By the way, their job titles are in no way indicative of what they actually do. 
I'm pretty much just running on now, but as a last word, check out Michelle Garcia Winner on the web.  I think her website is socialthinking.com.  See if you can take out some of her books from the library.

I work with a couple of adult women that have autism.  I completely adore them.  They are both very inquisitive and want to know everything about you.  Then when they see you they always ask about your cat, mother, father, kids, etc.  It's how they relate to you.  I find that they are the closest and most loving to the people who are consistent with them.  Their minds are running 90 mph all the time, so it feels good to them to stick to a routine and know what is going to happen and when.

My step son is 7 years old and was diagnosed with a very mild case of autism when he started nursery school.
My husband and I have his two children (both from a previous relationship) every week.
I found that my step son has selective eating (associates certain food with certain houses), has a limted diet (primarily junk food), can get fustrated from very little, doesn't always respond to being called. Sometime I have to use my fingers and get my step son to follow them to my eyes and tell him to look at me, as he doesn't like making eye contact.
He gets on ok socailly but he doesn't express feelings very well. 
He often has accidents because his brain doesn't make the connection with needing the toilet and he doesn't know he's done it either. He sleeps in nappies still at 7 which apparently is the autism and occassioanlly when he comes to our house he has a nappy on and we have to change it because he won't use the toilet at all with a nappy on.
When we do have him, we make him go to the toilet every 15 - 30 minutes even if he doesn't need to go to stop him having any accidents. We picked him up from school one night and there was a nasty smell, we got him home and he'd poohed in his pants and the school didn't do anything about it. When we got home to clean him up it it had everywhere and he didn't know he'd done it. 
I find myself getting fustrated with the diet and the fact he won't try anything new and if he does he makes a huge fuss over it and pretends he doesn't like it so he doesn't have to eat it and wants to spit it out. 
I know that his diet isn't all the autism it is also based on what he gets at his mums house which also fustrates me. 
The same with the toilet I think some of it is him being lazy. 
He loves anything to do with dinosausers and knows pretty much everything to do with them and wants to be a paleontologist when he grows up (his words).
If anyone here thinks I'm wrong with that then please educate me a little more on it then that would help me a lot as I don't really understand it. I know about the social implications and learning issues but thats all.

521,Aspergers: Reaching Out,"
I want to tell my story. I don't have Aspergers, but I have become friends with a young man who does. 
Greg came to our college with other freshman in the beginning of the fall semester. He quickly came to our club, The Storytellers' Guild. We're a gaming/anime club, and he probably felt like we all did, that he could finally fit in.
Greg was different from the moment we all met him. One of our members said part of it was due to the fact that he looked like he'd been bullied physically and emotionally on a level most people never reach. Other than that, none of us understood why Greg was so odd. 
We welcomed him at first, but found his limited conversational topics to be annoying an repetitive. His quirky speech habits and physical movements confused us. We're a very open and accepting group, but even we have our limits. We gave him a chance at first, but most of us became impatient and avoided him soon after. 
Shortly after many of us began verbally expressing our annoyance with Greg, a female member of the club stepped in. She said Greg hadn't old her, but she could see that he had Aspergers. She explained that it was a type of autism, and told us the symptoms. It was Greg, 100%. The best thing for someone with Aspergers is to get as much social interaction as possible in order to widen their social abilities.
So we all gave him a second chance. We re-invited him to lunches. We purposely talked to him. And you know what? He's improving! Even in one semester his conversation topics have expanded, haha. I had a conversation with him about something I'd never heard him talk about! 
I'm glad Greg found our club. We are accepting of people above the normal level. Most college students would look at Greg and hear him talk and not even bother. We're nerds, and we're nice  It feels good we've given him a second chance and are helping him to come out of his shell. He WANTS to be around people - that's where Aspergers is different from full autism.

I'm a member of the STG and can attest to Greg's improvement.   
I'll be honest, I was ready to chew out some of our members if they were mean to him but I found that people were ready to be patient with him as soon as I told them about his condition. He first opened up to me in private, when we were waiting for other members to come to an event. Greg arrived early so we had a moment to talk. This was when he told me about his high school experience and how I was the first girl to talk to him. Greg had come to me many times before to ask for academic and random advise, so I had talked to him enough times to realize that he had Aspergers. A semester ago he would only talk about Transformers: now he's interested in a variety of subjects. I asked him about his classes and I found out that his lowest grade was an A-!  Greg is a smart, good person and all it took to help him was an invitation to lunch and a few movies. All he needed was to be included and treated with respect.

Making friends is difficult for a lot of people (including myself), but Aspergers puts an extra barrier between the person and other people.  Niisu: It's great that you want to make new friends.  Finding people with similar interests can really make things easier.  Unfortunately, outside of school, there aren't a lot of clubs and groups.  
Also, I disagree with TMJWorld that it is the ""modern"" world that doesn't accept people who are different.  I would say that it has always been that way.  In fact, it is much better than it used to be.  There are a lot more accepting people out there now.

534,Fatigue and facial tingling?,"
This is related to something that I've had since I was a kid, its something that I've been aware of but never been able to pin down. I'll often have times throughout the day have my mental energy hit a wall. Standard response is that's normal, it happens to everyone. I worry though because it seems to impact my functioning and hit perhaps thicker for myself than most people I know. As of my early 20's especially forcing myself through it, I often get to the point where my forehead will start tingling from this situation - it's happened more and more often, as far as I can tell its the result of pushing myself farther than I should be going and this sensation typically goes away with rest. The real problem is that on some days I can get this point simply from reading a few paragraphs, other times when I need to lay down and close my eyes I'll feel like I'm expending more mental energy just being conscious than I have to budget. Needless to say when this does happen it impacts my work performance significantly, some days being better or worse than others. Occasionally in the past several years I've had times where this tingling would wrap my entire head, typically on these days I felt completely spent - like I could barely think about anything from start to finish. A bit more background on my health - I was diagnosed PDD-NOS when I was 11, I do have autistic traits although they aren't nearly as outward as they once were. I'm currently 31, the only other health considerations I have are hiatal hernia (maintained with Prilosec), I've also had life long sleep issues for which I take melatonin on a regular basis, I average 6 1/2  to 7 hours of sleep per night.
I find myself often wondering at this point what this is a sign of: whether I have an additional health issue that's gone undiagnosed (I talk to other people with Asperger's/PDD-NOS/autism on this - few can relate) or if perhaps if I've just stretched myself passed what my nervous system can deliver? I'm trying to figure out where to go with this as I realize that I'm at a point where I need to make a decision going forward on this - either in regard to medical attention or change of lifestyle if its something that can't be resolved. 
My question, if this is unlikely to be something that stems directly from my previous diagnosis, where would I want to look first to get this looked at further? If this is an autism related issue is there any medicine, supplement, or set of general health practices that helps to reduce this effect?

537,Vote for the WPI to get funds to study diseases including Autism,"
Hi to you all, 
I'm a patient and have something that is indeterminable between Fibromyalgia and ME/CFS (or perhaps both...). 
I would ask you to please vote for the ""Whittemore-Peterson Institute"" in the following contest, to help them gain significant amount of funds for research. The ""Whittemore-Peterson Institute"" is a non-profit institute based in Nevada that was established by the parents of a girl who has ME/CFS for decades. It is an institute that is focused on exploring the causes and potential treatments for neuroimmune diseases. Naturally, it focuses currently mainly on ME/CFS, but they also study other neuroimmune diseases, including Autism (and Fibromyalgia, Gulf War Syndrome, atypical MS, chronic Lyme Disease etc.). Currently the institute does not get money, or enough money, from the government, and its work is based on donations - and due to lack of money they cannot study right now some things that they want to study. The institute is participating these days in the ""Chase Community Giving"" contest - a contest that it's winners win prizes that are between tens of thousands of dollars and 500,000 dollars. The contest is now at its second and final round, where the prizes are significant. Please, please vote for the institute, as the money recieved in this competition may help people with Autism too (not to mention that there are many ME/CFS patients who have autistic children - and that might mean that finding something about one disease can help patients with the other disease). In order to vote for the institute, you should have a facbook account (if you don't - you can open one for free, and you don't have to share your real details there) and then you shell do two very quick things: 
1) Click on the following link and click the ""like"" button at the top of the page: 
chasecommunitygiving.contextoptional.com/ 
2) Click the following link and then click ""Vote & Share"": 
tinyurl.com/wpiround2 
And that's it - you have voted. Another thing that would help tremendously is if you'd ask your friends, family, facebook friends, email contacts etc. to vote. So if you can - it might help a lot. 
Some more about the Wihttemore-Peterson Institute (or WPI): Its target is to gain knowledge and find effective treatments for patients with neuro-immune diseases, such as ME/CFS, Fibromyalgia, Gulf-War Syndrome, atypical MS and Autism. What they are going to do is to open a practice there, with doctors carefully selected, and to use the knowledge gained by the doctors and patients, and the knowledge gained by basic research, to do ""translational research"" - turn it into things that you can use in the clinic - such as drugs and also biomarkers. In late 2009 the institute published a study in the most prestigous scientific journal in the world - ""Science"" - in which they found a retrovirus that was first found in 2006, named XMRV, in 68% of 101 ME/CFS patients, as opposed to 3.7% of 218 healthy people (controls). With additional tests they even showed that 98% of the 101 patients had evidence for infection with XMRV. Since then, there have been studies that did not find XMRV, in patients or controls, and a study by the NIH and FDA that found a very closley-related groups of viruses (named PMRVs) in 86.5% of ME/CFS patients, as opposed to 6.8% of the healthy controls. 
XMRV is the third known human retrovirus - the other two are HTLV, which causes leukemia, lymphoma, and a neurological disease, and HIV, which causes AIDS. Before XMRV was found in the blood of ME/CFS patients, it was also discovered in tissues from prostate cancer patients (significantly more in patients than in controls). There is also some unpublished work (just the results are known) that shows a connection of XMRV to breast cancer. Other, very small studies (included a small number of patients), that are unpublished, have also showed a connection between XMRV and: Fibromyalgia, Autism an atypical Multiple Sclerosis, and I think that also Gulf War Syndrome. If XMRV causes diseases, there are four existing drugs, which are today used to treat HIV carriers, which have been shown to be effective in vitro (in the laboratory, ""in a test tube"") against XMRV - and also 4 medicinal compunds that are in develope for HIV and have been shown to be effective in vitro against XMRV. So, if XMRV is found to be the cause of a disease (or more than one disease), there is a good potential that patients would be able to get good treatments for their disease within the near future. It is very important for a disease like ME/CFS, which have no drug approved for, and is also improtant for other diseases that would be found to be caused by XMRV. There is some interesting data from an oncologist which has ME/CFS and was found some years ago to be sick with Chronic Lympocytic Leukemia: He got tested for XMRV (those tests are currently for research, and are not yet approved by the FDA), was found to be positive, and then started taking two antiretroviral drugs that were shown to be effective against XMRV in vitro. He experienced some relief in his symptoms, and his measurements (from blood tests) - both of ME/CFS and of Chronic Lympocytic Leukemia, got significantly better. You can read about it here, in a blod of another doctor who has ME/CFS, and she and her daughter (who also has ME/CFS) begun treatment with three antiretroviral drugs (shown to be effective against XMRV in vitro), and although none of those three people got healthy, they all feel significantly better: 
treatingxmrv.blogspot.com/
Right now, the whole XMRV issue is in big debate, with scientists from both sides presenting their arguments - but what's important to know is that on the side that supports XMRV there are scientists with very big names - such as Dr. Francis Ruscetti, the discoverer of the first known human retrovirus, HTLV-1, and Dr. Harvey Alter, the discoverer of Hepatitis C and of Hepatitis C Virus. So, in spite of the debate - which is a big debate - there is a huge potential here, and the Whittemore-Peterson Institute is doing an enormously important work regarding XMRV, but the problem is that it is running out of money - they don't have money for many things that they would like to do, and that would help the dozens if not hundreds of millions of people around the world. Therefore, the prizes that they can win in this contest are important - and those prizes can make the difference in people's health. 
So, you would help us a lot if you'd vote for the Whittemore-Peterson Institute, and you can also help yourself, since one of the interest areas of the WPI is Fibromyalgia. Anyway, millions and millions of patients around the wourld would be most thankful if you'd help. 
Although the message I wrote might look as if I took it from somewhere - I did not. I am a patient. You wouldn't believe how many sick people can love scientists, when the scientists are doing everything they can in order to help them (and they can love them even much more when the scientists are not only trying, but also succeeding). It was said that ""there are 17 million ME/CFS patients around the wrold, and they have all contacted Dr. Mikovits (which is the research director of the Whittemore-Peterson Institute)"". I'll tell you, from my own experience: There are really many many many patients that contact her, mostly through email, and the amazing thing is that she answers everyone, in a personal way, and most of the times very quickly. 
The people in the Whittemore-Peterson are truely angels. And for them to be able to do the best work possible, they need research money (because the tests, the equippment and everything cost a lot of money, which they currently don't really have)...

Sure- my bro has it. 
First of all, he doesn't really have ""autism"", he has a syndrome which is on the autism spectrum. Autism is a different diagnosis. Individuals with asperger syndrome often are socially awkward- it may be hard for him to relate to others because he doesn't pick up on social cues that are obvious to the rest of us. They also may have unusual interests- by bro, for example, is incredibly interested in birds and everything he does seems to revolve around birds. They may have some repetitive movements such as tapping or hand motions, and they be impulsive and seem ego-centric at times. They often have trouble with change. They do not necessarily have any deficit in cognitive ability or language (their intelligence and language ability are similar to the average population).
Many people with asperger syndrome are also diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and anxiety. Many of the social symptoms can be dealt with by social skills training and behavioral coaching, teaching children how to get along in social situations and fit in better. Also, getting involved in a person's ""special interests"" can help you to connect.
Some things he does may annoy you- but perhaps you can tell him exactly hat he is doing that bothers you and ask that try not to do it? He probably has no idea it annoys you and would be happy to accommodate his behavior if you tell him (kindly, of course)

Aspergers 
Hi there
Aspergers is another name for autism, and the cause of autism has been isolated.
A Florida researcher and his co-workers and colleagues have identified a milk protein, casomorphin, as the probable cause of attention deficit disorder and autism. They found Beta-casomorphin-7 in high concentrations in the blood and urine of patients with either schizophrenia or autism.
The main protein in cow's milk is casein. This protein breaks down in the intestine to produce a peptide casomorphine, an opiate. Another researcher found that casomorphin could cause or aggravate the symptoms of Aspergers or Autism.
Another researcher wrote; ""The quantities of these compounds, as found in the urine, are much too large to be of central nervous system origin.
The quantities are such that they can only have been derived from the incomplete breakdown of certain foods.""
Allergies causes incomplete breakdown of foods.
And dairy is the most allergenic substance in the human diet.

Zinc is an essential nutrient for the glands and as the brain consist out of half a dozen glands Zinc could certainly improve brain function. Perhaps sufferers  would benefit from a zinc supplement.

550,Aspergers Syndrome,"
Grrrrr!!!! I keep reading these posts by people who don't know anyting about it!!! Unless you have Asperger's you don't really know whta it's like. ""Perhaps sufferers would benefit from a Zinc supplement""  *rolls eyes*... Who's to say we suffer from Asperger's disorder? I don't consider myself disabled at all! I am differently abled! I have a 155 IQ. I was able to study Violin, Viola, and Cello all at the same time for a year and be at the sme level as the high school students when I was in 5th grade! I can recite a story back to you word for word. I can remember what you were wearing and the first words that you said to me when we first met 10 years after we meet. I love having Aspergers.... I am a rarity among the rare... I am a female Aspie (when only 1 in 10 of people with Asperger's are female) and I am left handed to boot. My Asperger's helps with the analytical side of it and my lefthandedness helps with all my creativity! I can do anythingI put my mind to!

Please do not make assumpitons aout anyone with Asperger's Disorder. Just like everyone else, we are all different. Don't treat us like a text book. Some of us are very passionate about some things... Don't make fun of the passion your signifigant other has about anything. One of mine was Mythology my senior year of high school. I ended a relationship because he teased me about it. My next thing that I became facinated with was the promiscuity of early eras which led to my facintion in finding more about todays sexual promiscutiy and the psychology behind it.  My ex is kicking himself now. Who wouldn't want a creative intelligent girlfirend who is sexually curious while still being fairly innocent? My current boyfriend never pressures me and never teases me. don't hurt your other because it may come back to bite you in the ""you nkow where""....

551,Aspergers Syndrome,"
I hate having it (although it looks a lot more like Autism that AS).At school there was a girl with downs syndrome who coped better than me yet people say if you look normal,then you are.
When I was 14 I had sadistic teachers,so when I was terrified of stuff,they'd purposely drag me into those situations and I ended up so distressed I was destroying myself and getting worse and worse by the day.The other kids saw how bad I was so they started bullying me by purposely using situations to make me more terrified than I already was and laughing at me.Yet what gets me is if I LOOKED as slow as I was,the teachers wouldn't have let it happen,they wouldn't have dreamt of being sadistic and many would've intervened,but oh...I forgot,it doesn't matter how much mentally challenged people suffer.You have to look downs or something.
(P.S AS people aren't slow.I mean people who are actually mentally impaired and stuff).
And if you look the part,you don't get bullied either.

Catonia, you are  so very right!  That was how school was for me, with the ""adults"" being the worst instigators of all.  It was terrible for me, abused in every situation cause I looked fine on the outside.  Now my poor son, (21 now) certainly gets a lot better treatment at school than I did (big, BIG changes in special education!) but he still is sooooo tormented by people because he has no physical indicators on the outside showing autism as part of his insides!  Lord of the Flies was one of the most meaningful social commentaries ever as far as I am concerned!

557,Uncertain where to post this inquery,"
As most can interpret from the title, I'm not sure where to post this, but I think I may have some form of either a genetic or developmental issue.
I'm in my mid-twenties, but my physical appearance is that of someone in their mid to late teens. I'm sexually undeveloped, having no real impulses of a sexual nature.
Mentally speaking I'm very intelligent, my IQ qualifies me in MENSA, but I maintain some decidedly childish preferences, such as still being hooked onto Saturday morning cartoons and giggling like a child over some insignificant matter. I also have an extremely active imagination that runs away with me.
Socially speaking my relations to other people can be described as strange. People typically need an open mind around me mainly because I seem unable to determine what other people may view as appropriate as far as conversational topics go.
When I was younger one of my aunts (who is a doctor) believed that I had a form of autism. I'm not sure which form it was that she believed I had, but I was never officially diagnosed.

559,Avoiding eye contact with strangers,"
I recently recognized that my 3 year old son avoids eye contact with total strangers. There is no problem for establishing eye contact with his mom, me and people he knows. He also seems to look at his peers face/eye without hesitation. He is also delayed in speech. I know that these could be symptomps of ASD. However, I know that they are kids delayed in speech but don't have ASD. My son does not present any other symptomps as far as I see. He plays with other kids ( sometimes he bites or hits due to lack of verbal communication), he shows plenty of joint attention. He makes all kinds of faces, sad, happy, surprised etc. No toe walking, hand flapping and not a picky eater at all. He has some vocabulary he uses properly and is able show pictures on the book when asked. He shows body parts and makes correct animal noises when asked. I don't think he avoided eye contact with strangers all the time. It looks like a new habit to me. But it bothers me as a parent of a speech delayed child. What could be other reasons for this behavior? He also acts pretty shy among strangers like hifing behind my leg. He wad much more outgoing in the past. Ideas, opinions, suggedtions?

561,Advice on how to give an Autistic boy 8 medicine,"
Hi-my grandson is on a daily dose of medicine to help him with his extreme anxiety. He is Autistic with Intellectual Delays. It is only a small dose of 1ml, to be given twice daily. If we are lucky and he is hungry, he will take it spread with peanut butter on corn thins. The only other way is to give it to him spread on a toasted crumpet with vegemite. ( Yes, I am Australian) This little fella has a very limited diet - rice crackers, sausages, hot chips, an apple some days, a carrot some time, plain biscuits (we call them biscuits in Australia but my American partner tells me that they are known as cookies), popcorn, rainbow cake, ice cream, lemonade ice blocks and the only drink is diluted apple juice. The medicine has a very strong odour and he can tell if it is in his juice and simply will not drink.  We were able to hold him and force him to take it.This is just awful and causes him so much more stress. He is a very strong little boy and extremely hard to hold. He can also hold it down his throat and bring it up very quickly. We have taken a long time to adjust to him needing medicine but it does help him through distressing times that leave him unable to cope with anything. He attends a special School and anything outside the usual planned routine is so hard for him. He has very limited language but we starting to be able to understand him so much better. Any advice would be greatly appreciated = many thankls Robyn

563,Bach Flowers & Autism (Asperger's),"
My best friend turned me on to Bach Flower Essences which I guess are homeopathic remedies - Well actually the ones she uses are supposed to be better than Bach's but whatever...  In any event, I started using one called ""Student"" with my 4th grade autistic daughter who really is more asperger's.  Her teachers & therapists were commenting about what a huge change she had almost overnight.  Well I thought maybe she is just finally starting to mature and was a little hesitant to give all the credit to the Blessed Flower Essences.  Then recently I was out of town for a week and she didn't have any of her Bach flower remedies and I got an email from her teacher saying what a horrible week she had - so much so they almost sent her to the principal's office.  I got her back on her flower therapy immediately and she's been having nothing but really good days since.  Is this possible?  Does anyone else have any experience with these?  I have since used some for myself and have felt a HUGE difference.  Is this crazy?

I suggest you contact a speech therapist, also I suggest that since he is 3 years old also go see a Psychologist as they will assess him and let you know whether he is on the global scale for intellectual disabilities. My grandson is 4 years old and he doesnt use many words and is under a speech therapist at present and has also been assessed by a psychogolist, the last assessment showed that his visuals are up, but speech is improving less rapidly.  You can try your local health centres or maybe hospitals. I dont know what areas you live in but if your in australia we have quite a few people we can go through. I do not know if you have a disability service provider that is another avenue.

I have 2 brothers with Autism. One is on the lower end of the autistic spectrum and struggled with speech, he is turning 16 this year and has been seeing a speech therapist since he was 5 (when he started school). The speech therapist spent a lot of time identifying the sounds he had the most problem pronouncing and then listed the words/sentences that would be problematic for him...As i recall, he also had a more limited vocabluary than usual at the age of 3. 
His speech was very difficult to understand (unless you knew him well and could second-guess what he was saying) until about 5 years ago. I don't know much about the Australian system for speech therapists, nor do I know if they come into schools like they do with my brother, but I'd also advise a speech therapist who may be able to map things out clearer. 
Good luck, I hope I was helpful.

My daughter just turned 3 and is diagnosed with Severe Autism in her speech. She's been seeing a Speech Pathologist since she was about 1 1/2 years old. My daughter has not even a third of what your son can do. She knows about 50 words, but never uses them in context. She doesn't say sentences, she doesn't point, nothing. When we first started going to see a pathologist, she barely made a noise. Now that she's starting to get more on track, she's practicing her words and it actually seems like she wants to participate sometimes. She hums, babbles and so forth. She knows about 20 different songs, can sing them all, knows the interactive dances that go with them, and can count to 10 out loud with minor difficulties. I would definitely recommmend a speech pathologist, they do absolute wonders and the appointments are so much fun. Plus they help you work on what will help him, and give you hints and tips on how to get it achieved. My daughter absolutely loves going in to see her pathologist.

I am not an expert, but 22 month is sort of early for a diagnosis. Many symptomps cpuld disappear over the time. I heart that they wait until 3 or even more for a correct diagnosis. It's good sign that the person at the place you took your son did not see something wrong with your child. If you are still concerned, try to find the best place at your location for autism diagnosis. They typically have months of wait list. A group of experts not one gives a diagnosis.

My son is ten years old, and i'm wondering how we are going to make it to eleven.  He was diagnosed pdd/nos at 3 1/2, diagnosed with adhd a year ago, and two weeks ago, his pdd/nos diagnosis has been changed to autism along with depression.  He is verbal, and up until last spring not doing to bad at home or school (has a 1:1 aid in school).  Last spring however, he started being extremley violent, and since has been placed in a separate classroom and home life hasn't been going well either.  We are getting respite services, but it is really hard on all of us, especially his 8 year old brother.  The doctor said depression is common at this age with autistic children and that it is almost like a grieving process they go through trying to deal with their disability.  He just started imipromine for the deppresion and adhd and he is on trazadone and zeprexa at night to help with anxiety, aggression, and sleep problems.  The doctor said children who suffer from deppresion often become aggressive and the imipramine will hopefully work, but it may take 6 months.  I don't know if I can take 6 more months, and am not sure how I feel about the deppression diagnosis.  I'm not sure why, but that really bothers me, more so than the autism itself.  Anyone else go through this and survive to tell me about it?

My heart goes out to you!   My son has adhd and I believe is autistic, but is not ""officially"" labelled as of yet.   He is 7 years old.   
I just wanted to ask you if you have looked into food additives?   I found, accidentally, when my son was 3 that any food with phosphates in it made his symptoms much worse (phosphates are in 85-90% of all our foods!).   We removed phosphates and other food additives from his diet and, though he is not ""cured"", he is much easier to deal with.   I told many professionals about the phosphates and everyone said they never heard of that.   Recently, however, I got a book called ""prescription for nutritional healing"" and there is was!   Adhd kids tend to be very sensitive to this additive.    I have found in my research that kids with adhd tend to be very sensitive to chemicals in food.   I personally believe that is why we have so many kids with these problems.   Try removing phosphates from his diet.   The only bread that we found without phosphates is sheephearders.   Many 'store brand' foods are without it also.   You can find products without this additive, but you have to look.   Sugar is another serious issue for my son.   I try to limit it, but you know kids!
I hope this at least gives you another alternative to help with your son.   My prayers are with you!!!!!  Good luck!

so set a time limyÃ t before ahand instead of desturibing his focus. also keep the closest eye on any medication he is taking put down a diary of how he feels on certai medictaions

.....""he thinks he is right i just want him to fit in and not be aggressive""--the mantra of EVERY parent of a child on the Spectrum.....
ALL of the above posts are NORMAL for autism.  To all parents:  please stop taking your child's autism personal--and........LEARN!
Any more than someone with cancer, or a brain tumor can stop their bad behavior during illness/disease/disorder, neither can an autistic--or I should say ESPECIALLY NOT an autistic child.  This is NOT an EMOTIONAL issue.  Parents, this will be your most important hurdle to get over.  Your autistic child will only MIRROR your behavior(anger), and possibly magnify it when throwing it back at you(rage).  Always keep that in mind when dealing with your child--mirroring.
Second, watch ""Temple Grandin""--as stubborn as she was at making her points in life, YOU need to be just as stubborn when finding a good therapist for your child.  Someone who 'gets him/her' and can help you to get him/her.
I hope you ALL learn how to speak Spectrum quickly for your child's sake.  YOU must learn; your autistic children will not.  When YOU learn how to control your emotions AND learn about autism, you then can bond to and teach your son/daughter ""how"" to live.
Good Luck....

587,Not Talking At 21 Months,"
I know i know it can be just normal but at the same time i am concerned, because some of the things he does are similar to children with autism. Is there anyone else who had or has a child at this age that wasnt talking? Not to long ago he knew a few words, his first word at 8 mths was kitty kat but said kih kah, and he knew momma and dada and byebye, he said the word juice once. He still points to my belly and says bah bah cuz i told him when i was pregnant there ws a baby in there and i guess he is still under that impression. But now he doesnt say any of them at all. When he wants something he grunts and whines and twists his wrist while touching his fingers together instead of pointing a finger at it. At first i was thinking maybea hearing problem because u can say his name numerous times and he doesnt acknowledge it at all. But then i ask him if he wants juice he will hand me his cup and run to the kitchen so i dont think his hearing is the case. He seems smart otherwise and understands everything or most of what u say, i ask him to throw something a way and he will go do it , i got excited yesterday i asked if he could get me a diaper for jordynne and hewent in the cabinet and got one out and one of hers! If we could afford it right now id put him in daycare cuz im not sure if the not being around kids his age is affecting his not talking. Hes not like totally mute though he babbles but no real words at all. My mom got flash cards that i try and show him and piont and tell him the picture but he ends up grabbing all the cards and throwing them all over the floor or just wanders off and wants nothing to do with it. But i think at his 2 yr checkup if he isnt talking i will bring it up with the pediatrician because at 2 theyre supposed to know about 50 words and he doesnt even know 5 right now and he turnes 2 in august.  Sometimes i feel bad when i tell him off etc because for all i know he could have a real problem and not just be delayed or something so i treat him a little differently at times cuz he just seems special to me, hes bright and smart just the whole social skills etc he seems to lack and jason sorta favors jordynne at the moment, i guess she will be a daddys girl wich makes me feel bad that he seems to favor her more then joseph. It also makes me mad that brandy said that joseph was stupid and retarded and that im a bad mom cuz he isnt talking just because her daughter is and shes 3 mths older. But i havent really met anyone whose child was perfectly normal but at this age wasnt talking at all.
sorry for the long post

Im sure he is capable of talking because he does talk just no real words at all. sometimes he stomps his foot and says what sounds like ""oh god"" but hehe i dunno. Sometimes it seems like jordynne will be talking before he is, my sister thinks maybe because of jordynne thats why he isnt talking because she doesnt talk and gets things by crying etc so he sorta does the monkey see monkey do, her sons 3 mths younger and has a large vocabulary but he has a 4 yr old sister who talks and talks and never shuts up lol.

He may be imitating his sister.  That is a good point.  There are lots of signs of .Autism and being non-verbal isn't the only one.  If he gets what he wants by pointing, and gesturing than he has no reason to talk.  If he asks for something by pointing ask him to say it and try not giving it to him until he tries.  ""Oh you want the ball?  Can you say ball?"" 
I would go abolutely ballistic on someone who called my child a retard or any name just because they were mad at me.  Oh hold me back!!  Sounds like she is an immature little !**@!.

All the things you decribed about you son are exactly like my nephew.

Other then that he seems to be a smart, healthy boy, my sister and her husband are thinking that it might be a hearing problem as well. He is going on 3 years next month and has an older brother that just turned 4 in january, his brother talks great, says a lot and seems like your average 4 yr old, they play together(cause trouble together, lol) and everything else. I was reading a bit on autism and thought that it sounded a lot like that too.

Are you saying he has regressed in terms of his speech? Has it started since .Jordynne was born?
Let me give you a little on .jordan. We thought at one point(between the age of 2 and 2 1/2) that he was autistic. At the age of 2 1/2, he was only saying mama, dada & baba. he would point to things and say dada... he referred to everything that way. He couldn't chew(he didn't know how to) until he was almost 3. he did a lot of screaming, but not necessarily because he was angry...
Is he able to look in your eyes when he's being spoken to? 
What i would do(what i did) is see your doctor and address your concerns to him/her. They will refer you to a specialist that can help you and .joseph.

Go to your doctor's hun. They will help you find the resources to help Joseph. 
Jordan had help in a few different areas. They put him in an intergrated nursery which was connected to the children's hospital where he was going. He saw an Occupational therapist and Speech therapist directly through his nursery... it was great! But he also received more intense treatments at the hospital.

im not gonna tell you not to worry, becuse quite frankly you have every right to
but i watch a 2 year old (he turned 2 in faburary) and he use to not talk, he would point to something and grunt, then the grunt turned into him saying yeah, that was it, it was because his sister and old babysitter would talk for him and allow him whatever he wanted just by pointing
his doc got conserned and sent him for a hearing test, which came back perfect (as we all knew it would) and then he started comming over to my house and i watched him and his sister during the day (still do) and with his mum and me working together he now says a lot of words (mommy, mama, dada, baby, ball,ok, yes, ne, please, more, eat, pee, potty, poo, hair, eye, nose, teeth, knee, arm, etc) we dont let anyone talk for him and we pretend not to know what he wants when he just points, he has to say something befor ehe gets anything
his lack of words has really made potty training difficult, but were working on all this
i know no two kids are the same, but i hope my experiance with this kid can at least give you a little hope, im sure he is very very smart boy, he may just be being stubborn like alex (the boy i was talking about) is (and yes, it is just stubbornness now, he will say a word without meaning to and then pretend not to be able to say it again until you practically force him to lol)

There is a lot more to autism than the lack of speech. It can be difficult getting a correct diagnosis for your child, but follow your instincts. My son's paediatrician was unconcerned about the lack of speech in my child. He'll probably catch up all of a sudden was his learned opinion. No, nothing's wrong he kept telling us.  We knew differently but let ourselves be convinced because didn't want anything to be wrong. I now have a teenager who is both intellectually disabled and autistic, as well as suffering from coeliac disease. He had epilepsy for years too, but fortunately grew out of that, as he did with the asthma. None of this is probably the case with your child, but the point I am trying to make is that in some respects you have to be your own doctor. Have the child checked out, but make sure the doctor listens to and addresses all of your concerns. If you don't feel confidant with what they say see someone else. Early Intervention is the way to ensure the best possible outcome for a child. Good luck, and I hope your precious son will be chattering away soon.

I think you should read Jenny Mcarthy's book  Mother wariors. There are lots of accounts in this book that show children with very little or no speech.
I have a 12 yr old severley autistic son.
He talked up until his mmr injection then lost all of his words and eye contact and had temper tantrums.
Do you think your child might have a dairy intollerance?
Try taking him off  milk for a week or two, give him rice milk instead, but not SOY.
See if his language starts then.. it can help a lot of children, it depends on if you are wanting to try it or not. If it shows some improvement maybe you will want to elliminate wheat from his diet. It certainly would be no harm in trying. My 12 yr old son has improved from taking wheat/gluten and dairy out of the diet.

Hi! 
I wouldn't be too worried about your sons. The first words generally appear around the age of 12-18 months (50 word vocab by about 18 months)HOWEVER it is not abnormal for a child to develop slightly later than this. It doesn't reflect on their intelligence though! 
If your son is babbling, encourage him to do so. This is a time of vocal experimentation or 'vocal play' which is a precursor for true words. If you hear him use 'baba', start a conversation by saying 'ba'. If its a different babbling sound, use the sound he knows to start a conversation.
If in doubt, see a speech pathologist - they will help you a lot, and cater to your situation. I'm only a speech pathology student, so this is really the extent of my knowledge at the moment! Hope it helps though!

606,Possible signs of Aspergers Syndrome?,"
Hi all,
I'm a healthy young nineteen year old male who is seeking advice about a possible diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome. I feel so isolated out of society and it's very hard for me to make friends and keep them. I have struggled so much with anxiety and depression over the past few years. I love Nature and animals and I am so keyed in on these subjects that I have a hard time sharing anything else with others than what my interests are. I love playing music and I have been told I listen to the same music video over and over again, which I myself even acknowledge. I struggle with social interaction and understanding what sarcasm is and I am usually the last one to get the point of a joke. I cannot keep friends as said before and I struggle to understand my emotions and their emotions, such as thinking they are mad when they really aren't. I also don't usually feel empathetic to my friend's emotions. I have ""strange"" rituals that I have to adhere to or I get very frustrated. I also get frustrated when I get disrupted in my daily schedule. I can sit down and write an entire essay in a few hours and not even think about getting up or getting distracted to use the bathroom or get a drink or even answer my door if someone knocks on it (I am a first year college student). I did not talk when I was younger until about 3 years old and it took me a long time to learn to tie my shoes, ride a bike, and other activities that children should know how to do. I have taken up driving recently and not only am I so anxious with the new situation, I tend to shut down and make others drive me. I believe this is because of my sensory overload issues, because there are just so many different signals, lane changes, signs, and other actions on the road that it's hard for me to concentrate. 
I've always suspected I have Asperger's, especially after my Dad told me he believes it too. I have never been formally diagnosed with it before. Do I have Aspergers? Is it a good idea for me to seek out a diagnosis?

but even though its probably the last thing you want to hear instead of being able to give you a way to fix it..he did grow out of it.
It took a very long time and it was very hard..at one stage when he was going, he would never go to the toilet but he would pick at it,eat it and smear it on everything and up the walls.
but hopefully your daughter doesnt get like that.

You could start volunteering at an animal shelter.  Humane shelters are welcoming to volunteer's all the time.  I know it wouldn't produce income right away, but you'd really get so much out of seeing all these animals get homes and get the care that they deserve.  And perhaps it could even lead to a job opening in those facilities?  You could also apply to be a desk person at an animal clinic, sometimes you can be trained to be a veterinary assistant without a degree (with a degree, it would be considered a vet tech).  Again, it wouldn't necessarily be supportive income, but it would be a job doing what you seem to be partial to, nonetheless.  Hope this helps.

That would be pretty hard to do! Children with autism come with a variety of personalities, abilities, interests, etc. 
The most obvious thing you'll notice is the lack of social skills, most likely. It will take some time for you to learn to communicate and understand the person you are caring for and get to know them well. You will get to understand what they like, how they prefer to communicate, etc as time goes by.  
Other things you'll tackle might be other impairments that sometimes come along with autism, such as down's, cerebral palsy, retardation, etc. But not all children or adults with autism have these other conditions.

I am a mother with four Autistic children. Each one has different issues ranging from anger management, shutting down, hyperactivity and isolation. All of them do have one thing in common, poor social skills. The best thing for that is teaching them proper communication and trying to get them involved in activities involving other children their ages. 
Contrary to popular belief, most Autistic children are not mentally challenged. All of mine are straight A students in regular or advanced education classes. While children with Autism may appear to have learning disabilities, the problem isn't intelligence but rather how they learn. Their thinking may be completely backwards from most people but each one has their own unique way of learning and retaining the information. Also, most people with Autism have one area they particularly excell at. Some common areas they excell at are music, art, math and science.

He is displaying all the classic signs of Autism. He is 2.5 years old not speaking at all. He is also waiting for some genetic tests. He looks very much like a williams syndrone child. He has a wide mouth (often open), sparse hair, low over creased ears, curved in little finger, low nasel bridge, flat feet, narrow chest at the top, genital abnormalities, eats massive amounts but does not gain any weight, no diagnosed heart problems as yet, had what we were told was a milk allergy as a baby yet his allergy test was clear. These all seem like williams but he has not got the open personality they discribe, he is very much showing all behaviours of classic autism, which is getting progessively more obvious. I know autisic children can have face dismorphia but are we missing something? It is awful but not knowing what is wrong is worst, the health service is so slow and nobody wants to diagnose anything yet, the doctor agreed he looked like williams but said there are many other disorders to consider and we have been left in limbo again. The blood test should be within the next 6-8 weeks.

Due to severe lack of social interacting skills, he has been threatened with the possibility of being taken off his college course, as social interaction is a large attribute to it. I worry that his lack of social skills will prevent him from being successful in life, or working in a social environment. How will he cope, without work?

Hi all, 
I hope you won't mind me posting this here even though I've only joined the forum today. 
I have an adopted son of 20 with autism. He is called Steven. I was ill after Christmas and arranged for him to go to his regular respite unit for three days. I was told the following day that he had been moved to a ""Positive Behaviour Unit"" and was pesuaded to let him stay there for two weeks ""to get myself back on my feet"". A Week later, I was told he was being kept there for an indefinate period to work on his challenging behaviour. He hasnt been allowed to return home since. 
He is in a terrible double bind. In the four months prior to him going away, we had 14 incidents of ""challenging behaviour"" at home. If you understand about autism and what an ""autistic meltdown"" is like, then the figure of 14 isn't too bad. In the seven months Steven has been at the ""Positive Behaviour Unit"", they have recorded 306 ""incidents"". Lots of experts in the autism field have contacted me to confirm that greater levels of aggression = greater levels of anxiety but social services are refusing to acknowledge this. Earlier this year, Steven was left unsupervised in the care home (and there were only 2 other residents), left the house and met a vicar whose glasses he removed. As a consequence of this, the local authority served Steven with a Deprivation of Liberty order. 
On that afternoon, Steven was left unsupervised and left the premises on his own. I've never been able to find out exactly how long he was on his own. To this day, the Authority havent acknowledged they failed in their duty of care that afternoon. I'm not into blame at all but it seems that to cover up their own failure, Steven is to some extent, carrying the can. The vicars glasses incident happened on 16th April. On 17th April, I met with the manager to discuss and agree the next phase of Steven's transition home programme. On 19th April, Steven was served an emergency Deprivation of Liberty Order, which is still in place. The order wasnt mentioned during the meeting on 17th April and on the 18th April, Steven went swimming without incident and came for a home visit without incident. I've never received an answer as to why the order was served, and why was it served at that particular time. 
The latest bombshell is that they want to move Steven to an out of borough specialist unit to work on his ""extreme challenging behaviour"". This will cause untold damage as he will lose his normal support workers, his friends and all the places he goes to that are so important in helping him feel secure. 
There is a money angle to this case. It is becoming increasingly clear to me and Steven's supporters that the Local Authority are trying to shift the cost of Steven's support package on to the PCT and the only way they can do that is by exagerating the challenging behaviour because that will score him more points and move him into PCT funding category. 
I could write reams on this story but really came here to ask if you would be willing to a) find out more about this case and b) if you agree, sign the petition to allow Steven to return home. 
Thanks for reading this and if you feel you can, please pass this on to family and friends. Steven just wants to be home with his family and friends who he has lived with quite happily and successfully for the last 15 years.

I would get an attorney ASAP. I really don't think the way the police and facility are acting is constitutional. If you cannot afford to hire one to work the case maybe get one to send a letter, a lot of times that will get the ball moving into your court. Good luck!!

623,Undiagnosed Asperger's,"
After a couple of months of researching and talking I have discovered that my friend is undiagnosed Asperger's with some type of anxiety, depression disorder. I am writing this because he sometimes withdraws and disappears from my life. He never seems to know why and talking to him is sometimes impossible because he misunderstands and takes things so literally, but I'm finding myself getting depressed never knowing if during one of his withdrawing episodes if he will ever come back. I am making this post to ask advice and if anyone knows of any recovery or support groups to help me get over this, to let go and accept that I can't control it and how, if he comes back, can I present him with this or help or do things differently. I love my friend and would do anything for him.

It looks like you are not getting the help you need....Children with autism can and will be very demanding, they will throw tantrums and hurt themselves as most of them have a delayed pain threshold. My daughter use to put her hands under hot water and not feel it. I suggest that you contact the Austistic Association in your area and ask them for help as they actually do parental courses on how to deal with challenging behaviours also contact your local Health Centre as they can help as well.  It is not you okay....My brother has intellectual disabilities with Mild Autism and as a child he had very challenging behaviours as sometimes they can have Asprexia and Dysprexia. 
It is hard when a child has two or more disabilities my daughter has Aspergers/ADHD/severe learning difficulties and the specialist told me that she is fighting amongst herself constantly trying to come to some normality.
So I suggest contact these people straight away, they will get you on the road to a better child.

I also suggest that you look at your childs diet. Many like myself with my son have had great success using a combination of a gluten free diet and certain suppliments.(diary products, corn, soys etc can also have an effect)
In ours and many cases Im aware of doing such has really limited or almost eliminated severe tantrums & anger issues.
Ofcourse every child is different so I recommend you get in touch with a professional that deals with this area of expersise.

627,How do I discipline an autistic pre-schooler?,"
I have a 4 year old autistic little boy named Wyatt. He has a few odd behaviors that I hoped I can get some advice on.   
Starting about 6 months ago or so, he has begun to spit. My husband dips and spits in a cup so I know that is where he picked up the horrid habit. My husband tried not to dip in the house around the kids but he is so addicted that he caved. Whenever we give my son a drink, he will take a swig and hold it in his mouth. He will then go over to the tv stand, table top, or window sill and spit out the drink and play in the puddle! We tell him ""No!"" and warn him that if he does it again, we will take the drink away. He NEVER obeys! He always continues the spitting. When we take the cup away, he gets really angry and starts destroying things in the house. Sometimes it is so bad that we have to put him in a timeout in his room until he calms down. Afterwards, when he is calm, we give him back the drink and he just does it again! Aaagh!
Also, he is not potty trained.   I have a 2 1/2 year old daughter who IS potty trained and we were hoping he would pick it up to be like his sister. Nope! LOL. He has no interest in the potty whatsoever. Once in a blue moon we will succeed in getting him to sit on the potty without his clothes. He happily sits there for a good 5 or 10 minutes but then he stands up and pees on the carpet! He'll spread his legs a little and sing ""Peee!"" while waving his hand in it and then when he's done, he'll sit back down on the potty!
Any thoughts or experience with these types of behavior will help immensely!!

628,risperdone medication,"
Hi all,
Im new to the forum I have an 11 year old severe autistic son, learning 
difficulties.  
My son has been taking risperdone medication for anxiety and rages.  It
has been really great for him as i just couldnt cope any longer with the
rages and anxiety.  He has been on a very low dose of 0.5mg originally 
started out on this after 4 weeks doing great so pschiatrist
decided to lower it to 0.4mg the day i reduced this and my son 
went to school, teacher noted their was a change in his behaviour
and the old 'traits' were coming back before he started this med.
So im just wondering would a 1mg change make a difference to
behaviours and anxiety.  
Does anyone have experience with their child taking risperdone,
i would appreciate any replies.
Thanks

Risperdone dosage depends upon age and weight, so I imagine that a slight change in the dose (even .1 mg) can alter the treatment results.  
In a study about personalized dosing, a team from the Univeristy of Kentucky found that the tolerance of Risperdone and the need for higher dosing is not totally understood ---  other brain receptors, such as other dopamine, serotonin, and adrenergic receptors may explain the need for higher doses.
I hope this helps!

632,risperdone medication,"
I have never heard of Risperdone. Risperdal is actually the trade name for the drug Risperidone, so they are one and the same. My son takes Risperdal - only 1ml twice a day, and it has been an absolute godsend. Without it he can become impossible to live with. Unfortunately it has been responsible for a major gain in weight, but I guess nothing is perfect. Fat is better than violence!
",http://ehealthforum.com/health/risperdone-medication-t155887.html,188083,627
633,risperdone medication,"
I am of the opinion that respiradal is good for anxiety and violence.  However, you also need to work out what is causing the jealousies that makes someone anxious/violent in the first place.  For example, when I was younger (and even still happens now) whenever I used to invite my best friend to my house my younger sister used to take over and eventually my best friend used to hang around with me at school but hang around with my younger sister when I invited her back.  Now this provoked all sorts of questions in my head that I never discussed with anyone - I had feelings of unfairness, jealousy and feeling scared of going to school as it was difficult to make other friends because my best friend was always there.  Gradually the situation became a little better as my younger sister moved away from home and made seperate friends there, however she has no local friends so as soon as shes visiting my parents house, whether my parents are home or not, she's visiting my best friend (haha! can hardly call her that the trouble/aggrevation she's caused me hanging round with my younger sister.  As well as the obvious feelings of inadequacy, jealousy and feeling of anxiety going to school.  When I was 20, I fell very ill with schizophrenia where i was even extremely scared of going outside my bedroom to the bathroom, downstairs to eat or even out the house, I had troubles completing my degree I was doing then because I could not concerntrate and had memory problems.  
So my advice to you is, please please if you have more than one sibling, even if they/re in the same year group or 1,2 3 years apart they must have seperate friends for there not to be any jealous feelings or anxiety caused by the friend situation.  Other factors that create jealousy and therefore violence may be one behaving like they are being treated superior to the other sibling even though all your attention is shared evenly amongsth them.  There may be more going on between the siblings than you are aware of, for example your child on respiradal may be not sleeping properly or may not be able to relax in your environment.  His brother/sister may constantly be asking him questions and not leaving him alone to get on with his own activities and making his own fun.  The child may need one-to-one help for studying to get good marks and make good development.  I would tackle these issues soon and ask for help from a psciatrist to try and deal with everything surrounding it.

634,designing for the autistic children,"
Hi everybody, I am currently a final year industrial design student working on my final year project and I am really interested in designing something for the autistic children. However, to be able to design something useful for these children, I would like to have your valuable inputs on any problems that you encountered whilst taking care of your children. 
Also, i thought of an idea but i'm not sure if its feasible enough, hence i would appreciate if you could give me your views on this. I understand that going through puberty is one of the greatest problem parents feared because the child may have a difficult time trying to cope with the changes that they experience.
Hence, I thought of designing a menstrual tracking device that allows parents to know when their child would be having their next period (without the use of a device like the digital clock which is often not accurate) so that they would be more aware if the child suddenly started throwing tantrums cause of pms. 
This awareness would allow the parents to better prepare their child for their menstruation, as i understand that some parents would give their child supplements during this period. I understand from a gynae that most parents would actually give their girls a jab so that the period will not come for months, or maybe even opt to take out the uterus. 
However, i was wondering if this option could lessen the frustrations and make growing up a less painful process for both the child and the parents? Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you guys and i welcome any suggestions! 
Do feel free to write me if you have any suggestions!

636,Early signs of autism ?,"
Hi. I'm a mother of an 11 month,2 week baby girl. I have some concerns regarding her development. 
I have recently discovered that she alway's resist's cuddles, I have never been able to give her a cuddle without her fighting to get out of my hands or cries to be released from the hold. When she was about 10 months old she started to say dada, but now has completely stopped saying it. I also believe that she's not babbling as much as she used to, she used to have chats with me. She does interact a little bit with playtime but I think she prefers to be on her own, as she takes a toy off me and then goes away with it. She does seem interested in people giving her attention but does'nt maintain eye contact with anyone. She also flaps/twirls her hands and feet. She will put an object (especially the corner of her wrap) very close to her face and make loud ohh ohh ohh sounds. 
Please advise me if I need to be concerned with autism.
Thank you and kind regards

You shouldn't dismiss any symptoms of autism.  You need to get your daughter evaluated, either by your pediatrician or a specialist.  Even if you are worrying over nothing, it is serious enough a possibility to take it seriously.  
If it is autism, don't lose hope.  Early intervention is key to better outcomes.  There are therapies that can make a difference.  I hope sincerely that you turn out to be wrong, but you need to make sure.  It might even turn out to be something else that can be treated.

Hi, Julina.  I am the mother of an Autistic son; my first grandchild was also diagnosed w/Autism at 18 months as well.  From what you described, if it were me I would have my little girl at least tested for the syndrome, it's best to safe than sorry.  My son was also diagnosed at 18 months.  He is now in H.S. and is taking the Regents exams.  He was one of the first children to receive ABA in the State of New York.  My granddaughter had no language, hand flapped and tantrumed, just to name a few of the symptoms.  Today at age six she has developed language, can recognize all 26b letters in the alphabet, can count rote numbers to 40 and can also recognize 20 sounds of the alphabet.  It is better to test and catch the syndrome early.

Thank you MirahU and firebabe1 for your wonderful support and advise. I have had my daughter assessed today by a Behavioural Ped Doc and he has informed me that we are looking at PDD-NOS, s disorder of the Autism Spectrum. He has advised to keep monitoring her until she is 18 months till we can do the official testing and Early Intevention. I have also been advised by my Family Doc not to do her triple vaccine as it may trigger a regression but the Behavioural Ped Doc has advised it isn't directly linked to regression in Autism. I'm so confused to whether I should do her vaccine or not. I have heard so many stories from experienced parent's that when their children had the vaccine that they regressed. I think I should at least postpone it for a little while to see what happens.
Is it common for the children to regress after the triple vaccine.

now he is being assessed for autism. im just frustrated because i feel that im a failure...an incompetent mother who cant train a child to be a smart one. he knows nothing. cant even count. doest know his abc and colors too. 
even if i sing to him everyday, repeating the songs over and over again, he cant remember them. 
well, i taught him action songs and he does it sometimes...very seldom, i should say.

Hi,
I am telling you the symptoms of autism for babies.
Children with autism often appear to be in their own little world. They have trouble engaging in back-and-forth play, sharing emotions, making friends, and understanding what others are thinking and feeling.
It involves problems with verbal and nonverbal communication
Autistic children often show signs of repetitive or ""stereotyped"" behaviors and narrow, constrained interests
If this signs are relating to your child check it  
Don,t worry this is not a big problem but as soon as you take step it will help you

He has not been around alot of children untill now and is showing very aggessive behaviors- hitting and kicking and I want to know how to help him to not be so aggressive. I have started whispering in his ear at night after he goes to sleep and it has helped him to sleep most nights, but if he see something scarey during the day it affects his sleep. He hates loud noises and masks or people with painted faces. And often screams when he is frustrated. But his parents faught constantly when he was a baby so he witnessed alot a hitting and screaming. He has showed these behaviors since I took custody. And he can be the most loving at times. I find the more gentle I am with him the more I can get him to cooperate.

Has he been diagnosed with Autism?  
It could be that he has something else going on.  It's not unusual for children to act out when their family life is disrupted.  Have you taken him to a child psychologist and had him evaluated?  The fact that you say he's very loving makes me think he probably isn't autistic or has a pretty mild form.  
Whether he is autistic or has some emotional problem, he's going to need extra help, attention, and maybe therapy.  The earlier it starts, the better off he'll be.  To find out how to get more help, contact your local department of children's service or some other organization that would be able to point you in the right direction.  In many places, a diagnosis like Autism can get him a special education aid in his classroom that can help him and his teacher.  
I wish you all the best.  You are doing a wonderful thing raising your grandson.  He is very lucky to have a grandmother like you.

653,Aggressive behavior and autism,"
Hi Grandma,
Witnessing physical abuse by anyone is difficult but when you witness it by your parents and at such a young age it is devastating.  Perhaps your grandson isn't suffering from autism but from the same form of behavior soldiers suffer from after coming out of a war...PTSS Post traumatic Stress Syndrome. One does not have to be in a war to experience the effect of it by seeing first hand the violence of it.  Please don't allow him to be medicated just yet unless he is in danger of hurting himself or anyone else via using a dangerous object etc.
In the meantime until you hear from the doctor, continue to be patient with him.  Shower him with the kind of love only a good grandma like yourself can give.  Alhough, you may not notice a difference now, you will.  He need assurance that he will not have to return to that enviroment ever again.  Time, love, safety and patience are the resources he needs immediately.
God Bless you, you are a true Angel.
Faded Rose

His Mother now hates me for taking him but, I could not stand by and let him go through the abuseive atmosphere he was experianceing. He is so precious and is very loving, He deserves a chance to know that he can live in a happy loving enviroment and be safe. I will do what ever it takes to make sure of that.

Meet regularly with the special education teacher 6-8 weeks. Also, ask for the special education case manager at school to keep in contact with you regarding his progress. Make sure that there is an assessment being done so that data can be used to create a plan of action for your grandson's success.

658,Slow development,"
He knows a lot of words, but has only limited ability to put them together to express his ideas. He can say ""eat bread"", ""let's go home"",and most other basic needs, but he never says something like ""mom, don't go there, play with me"". Some pronunciations are clear, some are not, and some are not understandable. He doesn't play with peers, although he often shows great interests to familiar adults (neighbors, friends), and makes eye contacts. He is very intimate to family members. He was born one month earlier, and has weak motor skills. He can jump, but never jumps down from a small step, and we have brought him to a motor training program now. He shows no interests in playing most toys, and is only interested in music toys and interactive toys (we bought him a toy phone that can randomly ask players to recognize the numbers, colors, and figures on it, he loves it and play very well, almost makes no mistakes!). He can follow most orders, but sometimes it is hard to manage him -- once he needs something he must get it almost without waiting. Please help me!

661,Autism and Possible Post Traumatic Stress,"
I have recently been diagnosed as an adult with Aspergers and have been verbally abused for it through out most of life. Sometimes when I go to do things I become very anxious and discouraged if they are related to minor mistakes I've made because of my condition. I was also yelled at for not behaving properly in social situations, and I grew up in isolation without understanding why. Before my DX I had clinical depression and suicidal thoughts related to the abuse and my DX. I'm off meds right now and I'm no longer depressed but I think I may have Post traumatic stress from my family's poor understanding and ill treatment towards me before the DX. My mother would never admit that she was abusive but my close friends and co-workers have told me to move out and stay away from her. I live with my parents because I'm technically saving for College but the reality is that I have too much difficulty looking after myself and I need help and reminders from other people to do things that need to be done to maintain certain aspects of daily life. I'm getting some form of help with this from my doctor but she told me only 10 percent of people like me can successfully live on they're own. With the stress around my parents it's hard to live at home and I would like to move out, but right now my doctor and I think it's not a good idea. Should I be seeking help for possible Post traumatic stress? Has anyone else been in this kind of situation before?

662,schizoaffective disorder,"
I am autistic and was also diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I want to make a difference in the world. When I was 5, a panel of doctors told my parents that I would never make friends, never go to school, never make anything of myself, and when I would be an adult that I would have to be put away for the rest of my life. It was a devastating thing for a parent to hear. I am living proof that anything could happen and I want to spread that message. I have been through rough times, people in middle and high school attacked me physically, verbally, and emotionally on a daily basis. I am now a famous artist and am going to be in at least 3 magazines next year, probably more. I want to speak at autism and mental health conferences. I want to tell people with disabilities or parents of those with disabilities that everyone has a gift, they just have to find it. I didn't start drawing until I was 12 and am 25 now. My fine art cards are in over 20 stores in Washington State including zoos, casinos, pet stores, flower shops, galleries, and other stores. Just because you have a terrible label on your head, doesn't mean it will be there forever. I started coming out of autism when I got a dog named Lady. I was fixating on the movie Lady and the Tramp. Then at 12 i discovered my art talent at school when we were doing a project. I believe that disabled people are more capable than you think. When I was severely autistic, I would scream if something was off or different, not make eye contact, I wouldn't be talking or socializing with people at all. It was truly a miracle. I am a success story and I will give other people hope and inspiration that anything that they put their mind to can happen. When my business gets huge, I also am planning of donating some of the profit to different organizations. I want to help people. I also want to speak at NAMI conferences. That is the one for mental disorders. I have many friends with schizophrenia and I think they are much more capable than others think. They are friendly and intelligent. I think they can hold a decent job and make money, not just be on Social Security and be poor for the rest of their lives. One of those magazines that I am going to be in is Dog Fancy. It is coming out next year. I am a pet portrait artist, a marine life artist, and a wildlife artist. I love animals and that is how I connect to the world. I also plan if children's hospitals order my cards (my scenes are perfect for kids- they have bright colors and animals) I will spend a day with the children drawing with them. I am also planning to write a book about my story and also illustrate a children's book which we wrote a long time ago but it isn't illustrated yet or sent to a publisher. It is an educational book about the rainforest. I want to travel the world with all the information and inspiration that I have.

Hi, my name is Tina and I have a 10 year old brother who was diagnosed with Autism.  He has Autism because he got mercury poisoning on his brain from the themerisol in his vaccines.  He also inheirited a mutate MTHFR gene from both his parents (my mom and step dad).  He is non verbal, can not have a communication device because he was ""Steaming?"" off of it more than he was using it, he knows a little sign language (mainly uses signs for yes, and more) and we have always been able to know when he is upset or doesn't want something to be happening.  He started getting really aggressive and trying to hit people and it just has been getting worse and worse.  He doesn't want anyone to talk at all, not at all.  He covers his ears a lot now and has a lot of melt downs (several a day) and hasn't been able to sleep at all really (maybe a few hours a night,at best) and when he does get to sleep it isn't really deep sleep and he's up several times a night headed to my mom and step dads room trying to hit them (he has been hitting very hard, not holding back or stopping at all).  He's been diagnosed with everything under the sun in addition to his Autism (Bi Polar, Manic, Epilepsy, depression)  and recently he completed a carbohydrate specific diet that completly clean out his intestines.  He was taking mostly vitamin or natural supplements, with the exception of Zoloft liquid.  He doesn't eat dairy, wheat, gluten, or dyes .  We get special flour and recipes to maintain this diet.  He drinks mostly carbonated mineral water (with flavor, but no sugars or dye)His exceptional quality is that he is a wiz at using anything electronic, computers being his specialty!!  He can run a computer fowards and backwards, he always knows what steps produce what results and he can troubleshoot them really well.  He remembers everything, he only has to see someone (just see, not be shown) how to do something, anything, ONE maybe TWO times before he knows how.  He is wonderful and we all love him with all our hearts!!  Recently he was also diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder.  They have him taking Seraquil now and after he gets better sleep for a while they are going to put him on a mood stablizer.  I would appriciate any thoughts on this topic, but more than anything, I would like any support you can offer my mother and step father who are under a huge amount of stress right now.  Please help put hope and support back into their lives!!!

I am doing research for myself and a phsychologist on the subject of treatment strategies and copping mechanisms for people on the autism spectrum and exhibiting psychosis as part of Schizophrenia, Brief Reactive Psychosis or Shizoaffective. In originates from my psychology firend's practice in Canada. I hope you don't have something against Canada.
In specific can I get a hold of ""writer75"", ""SisER"", and ""PsychoPsychic"".
your testimony is unique Psychopsychic and I would like to get in contact with you. I think all of you are doing really good in holding your life together. Mine is not so together. But when do we have it all together anyhow...?
I read a lot to ""writer75"". Well autism and schizophrenia is starting to be considered at opposite ends of continuum of paternal-maternal genetic influence and come from the same genome. So it is possible to have traits of both and if you have dimensions of both disorder, things can get confusing. I would suggest finding a psychologist or psychiatrist that diagnosis Aspergers in your area.

Hi all!
I just wanted to share with you a product that I found and loved! USA Skypanels is a light diffuser and replaces those horrible florescent panel lights. Skypanels is known to help children with Autism as well. We were in a doctor’s office that had them and they were great, we got them for our house as well. They are easy to install, quick, fast and they are inexpensive. They also relieve headaches and seem to work for seasonal depression. Here's part of an article I found --
Children effected by autism and other disabilities have shown improvement when placed in environments with Skypanels™ light diffusers. Skypanels are a unique product that have been linked to helping people who suffer from seasonal depression, promoting communication in children with autism, and reducing tension headaches caused by traditional overhead light diffusers. It also has a calming effect, elevates moods, brightens up a room, and brings the outdoors inside.

Please talk to a registered nutritionist, one who works with autistic folks especially, if there's one near you. The intestinal tract has an incredible ability to heal itself so don't despair! And READ Enzymes for Autism and other Neurological Conditions by Karen DeFelice. Buy the book now. Order it from Amazon. I believe the right digestive enzyme supplement will help heal your child more quickly.Specific nutrients are essential and healing to the gut, and although finding your child's specific nutritional needs is important, a digestive enzyme product such as Zyme Prime or Peptizyde can start helping him right now. These products have been described by some people as ""miraculous"". My son is not autistic, but had many conditions sometimes associated with autism, including malabsorption. I don't normally go around plugging products, but I have learned a lot since my son got sick, and I believe in the healing power of digestive enzymes (also slippery elm, but that's another story).

My thoughts are with you. I know how difficult it is having Asperger's and going to school -- especially with Bipolar. (I am 16; have Asperger's, and I am currently diagnosed with a Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Depression. I was in the 11th grade, but now I will have to repeat because of my medical issues, and I will be doing it through the home-schooling/TAFE option in Australia.)
If he really doesn't want to go to school, chances are even if he goes to school, he will not get a good mark. Kids with Asperger's really do not thrive in an environment they do not want to be in.
Maybe if you have a home-schooling option in your area or country, where he can be educated in a better environment, might help him. Or if they have special schools for kids with Autism Specturum Disorders in your area, that might help -- being with like minded kids helps immensely.
I really hope you find a good solution to this problem.

If your son is doing well in the school he is in I would do everything you could to make sure he can stay there, especially if he's just two years from graduation and it's not too far away. I don't know where you are from but my son is 7 and he also has Aspergers and GAD and we called together a School Intervention Team meeting and discussed his case when we first got the diagnosis, and we put together a plan to help him succeed and monitor his progress. Like I said, it really all depends on where you are from if your from the US you can look up your district office you should have something like an ""Exceptional Student"" Education type office, they do evaluations and so on and you can explain his special needs and plead a case for keeping him in the school he's in. Ask the school principal where your son goes to school, there are more programs and options then you think if you can go digging. Good Luck!

When he was 8 mths old he said kitty cat although it sounded like kih kah. then aruond 12-14 mths he said byebye, but other then that i havent noticed a real word, sometimes he says stop it, but he says it over and over a few times. he has said puppy before a few times but thats it, and i read by age 2 there vocabulary should consist of like 50 words and he really doesnt even use one . sometimes he says dada, but again most of the time its repetetive. He also throws tantrums alot. when he doesnt get his way he will lay on the floor and bash his head on the floor or hit it on a table or stick his fingers in his mouth to gag himself, i ignore it in hopes he will stop but so far no luck there. He understands things, like i ask for a kiss he gives me one, i ask if foods yummy and he smacks his lips , i ask him if he wants to take a bath and he goes right upstairs to the bathroom. But he doesnt talk, he has his own language that he bables in sometimes though. He goes for his 2 year checkup next week, im wondering should i bring this up with the dr and what should i ask to help him out?

I would bring it up. he could just be slow. or he could have a mild form of cerebral palsy. 
tempertantrums are usually a sign of frustration. not being able to tell you what he wants etc. ( do you notice when his tantrums occure? is it when he wants something? or just when you say no to something?)  
if he is doing it because he wants somtheing and you said no extinct it(ignore it) i will warn you that ignoring a behavior will cause an increase in that behavior but it will go down in frequency when he realizes that you arent going to give in.  let us know how it goes. ill be praying for you.

hey sortof sounds like me. when i was a baby and a kid i never talk but then again i couldnt talk.it took me almost 10 years to talk. iam speach impaired. i dont know what kind of speach imparement i have. i was a little kid and i remember going to a speech therapist at age 2. from hard work i began to speak around 10 of age. 8 years of working hard. and now i just stop going to her when i was 16 and now iam 17 and a half. but i still have trouble talking but mostly its pronoucnig and rarly people dont understand me and when i was a little kid the doctors i went to said i will never speak in my life. so maybe this is the same situration like i have. plus you should tell your doctor about this also like dyanmatteson said. good luck i hope this helps you a little.

There are programs that your doctor can tell you about that may be helpful in returning or developing speech in your son.  Think about it carefully, but did he have any vaccines around the time he lost his ability to speak?  Are you still giving him vaccines?  Perhaps he has had some immune damage and needs more time to recover before you continue with more vaccines, if you decide to.  Please think about it.  My best friend has a beautiful daughter who is now 9 who cannot speak due to vaccine damage.  She also has mild retardation.  She was able to speak a few words up to about age 1-1/2.  She is not autistic nor does she have asperger's.  She just cannot speak and the only cause that anyone has ever been able to link to it is the vaccines she had.  I wish you both the best.

Autism has never been scientifically charged with causing autism.  I haven't read anything in depth about the vaccines, just know that there are ones that must be taken to prevent death or severe retardation.
I have all my children vaccinated because I do believe in what they represent.  I do not believe in government conspiracy theories either.....these sicknesses are only continued because of idiots who think they know better and do not vaccinate.  I am only speaking of those vaccines that are necessary and which prevent illnesses that cannot be otherwise prevented.  I will not have my children vaccinated with the HPV vaccine....they are not going to be sexually active until they are married, so why expose them to the risks associated with the vaccine?  I will also not have them vaccinated for the flu....it only prevents one strand of a viral infection, and does not prevent bacterial infections and other viruses.  Besides, most people who get the flu aren't going to be retarded or die from it.
It's just something that people need to have as a scapegoat for their drama.  I would say there are tons of reasons why there are things like autism, like marrying  a second cousin or closer (incest), genetics, drug and alcohol abuse, smoking......
The only vaccine left with questionable substances is the flu vaccine (which I think is pointless, but anyways) but you can request for it without those substances.

Maybe immunizations are the cause, maybe they are not.  It isn't going to stop me from protecting my baby from Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Polio, and all of the other terrible illnesses that he could die from or end up physically disabled from if he got it.  My father had polio when he was a child and he has suffered his entire life because of it.  If I can prevent my son a lifetime of suffering I'll do it.  
I have given this subject a lot of thought and I've done my fair share of research.  Having a child that has Autism has it's challenges I'm sure of that, but having a child die when I know I could have prevented it is more than I could live with.
If you compare other countries that do not use our immunizations I'm sure you will find that many of them do not immunize their kids at all.

There is no definite evidence, but I say why even chance it?  It's not even necessary to the products?

The so called link between the termosol vaccines and autism was that it contained mercury, which would stay in the brain and cause a child to become autistic. However, the type of mercury found in the vaccines wasn't elemental mercury, but actually a compound with mercury in it, called ethylmercury. Ethylmercury, unlike elemental mercury and methylmercury doesn't bio-accumulate in the body, it breaks down and is excreted.
In addition, Balldez, when you look at developed countries that banned these vaccines years ago, like Great Britain and Japan, they have autism rates that are actually higher then those found in America.

You also have to look at the fact that most kids who get vaccines don't get autism. I mean, autism is still pretty rare, and vaccination surely is not. 
And in most families of kids who have autism, it's only one family member. If there was an environmental factor, every child exposed to that factor would develop it.
I'm not saying it doesn't have anything to do with the environment, certainly there might be triggers, but that can't be all of it, or probably even the majority.

I was reading more about it because even though I don't think the vaccines cause autism, I had a sort of an idea about it........  the vaccines associated with autism was the MMR vaccine.
Maybe it's because of the variation of the sickness that they inject.  It's a dead form of the virus, but it's still the virus.  Those people who got the measles mumps or rubella and died......maybe, just what if, they hadn't died, do you think that maybe they would have some sort of autism from that?  Like it's one of the symptoms of measles mumps or rubella.  And that is the only part of it that comes out in the vaccine.
I don't know if I'm stating my thought clearly enough or not....but it was just my thought.  I'm still getting my kids vaccinated, even though it still scared the heck out of me, autism or no autism.

Just an FYI - mercury in any form is a known neurotoxin. The blood brain barrier is not formed in children. Nobody really knows when this chemical barrier in the brain is fully formed but it is not present in babies. There are indications that the bbb may not be fully developed until teen years. This being said, some children may be sensitive to thimerisol in vaccines or perhaps to the vaccine itself. More studies need to be done. Autism is not the result of incest, drug use or alcoholism.

716,Autism And Vaccines,"
Yes, toxins trigger symptoms. Vaccines, and many other things that get into our bodies can cause damage to our brains, intestinal tract, liver, etc. Vaccines are toxic, in varying degrees, and how well the body they are injected into handles the toxin depends on many factors. We are all individual,one-of-a-kind biochemical packages. Some of us have a mild fever after a vaccine, because our immune systems react to the virus, create antibodies, maybe some inflammation results, the virus is killed, we excrete the viral matter, recover and go on our merry way.
Others, due to a less developed, weak or damaged immune system have different reactions to the toxins they come in contact with - ingested, inhaled, injected or however.
Infants have immunity from their moms, until their own immune systems take over. No one can be sure, without blood tests, how well a child's immune system is working at any given time. One of the reasons doctors skip a vaccination temporarily when a child shows symptoms of having a cold, is because the child's system is already dealing with a virus or bacteria, and they can't know, without tests, if that child's immune complexes can handle the added burden without complications. We are all individual. 
Many studies have proven that infants and very young children do NOT have fully functional, correctly working intestinal tracts. Now, imagine that you're 2 days old, your intestines aren't functioning right yet, and a virus is injected into your body? (Most babies get their first shot before they leave the hospital, unless you object).
Are you going to be able to excrete all the toxic elements? Are you going to absorb the toxins into your bloodstream because of intestinal permeability? Are the toxins going to get into your brain because the blood-brain barrier isn't formed yet? Can your liver filter out the toxins? Or your kidneys? Have you been tested to make sure they are working correctly? 
I've read that in Japan they advise children be vaccinated only after the age of two or three-- because they know and understand now that a child's intestines can't deal with the vaccines until after it is fully developed. This makes sense to me.
Also, giving multiple vaccines at one visit is for the convenience of everyone involved, and does create a health burden for the child, whether symptoms develop or not.
True, most of us recover, or did we? Some studies that have been completed on the long term effects of vaccines strongly suggest they may be the cause of many disease conditions that develop years later, or whenever our immune system becomes weakened. (I apologize for citing studies without the proper info, I wish I had bookmarked them). Some scientists claim cellular immunity (which is what you would have after a disease, such as chicken pox) is a hundred times better (not specifically 100 times, just a figure of speech) than humoral immunity (which is what you have after a vaccine). Vaccines often fail.
Most elderly people today probably survived having measles, mumps, scarlet fever, rubella, chicken pox etc. because at the time they had them, their immune systems were not overburdened with toxins from various sources (environment etc). I HAD all of these diseases when I was young. I'm 54 and in very good health. (My mom and dad are both 86 and going strong, mentally and physically).
A cousin of mine caught whooping cough (pertussis) when he was two, and has brain damage (mental) he will have the rest of his life. Perhaps if he could have been vaccinated, he wouldn't be mentally disabled. Perhaps if he WAS vaccinated with a pertussis vaccine, he would have developed autism. Who can say for sure?
(He's 60 years old, by the way).
My son has health problems vaccines may have contributed to. He is not autistic, but had a few behaviors generally considered to be on the spectrum. 
If I could go back in time, knowing what I know now (how many of us have said that?), I would have waited until my son was 3 or 4 to get vaccinated. Or maybe no vaccines, just build up his immune system and get blood tests done to see how well it's working. 
I was sick as a child with those diseases, but I'm glad I had them and recovered. I'm sure my mom would have had me vaccinated with everything, if they had been available then. Would I be as healthy now as I am, if she had? I don't know. I guess it all depends on your total toxic burden. Kids these days have an earlier toxic burden, and pushing more and more vaccines into their bodies, just at the time brain development is so crucial seems evil to me now.
I will never tell anyone not to take vaccines, but people need to be less trusting of established medical practices and do their own research. (Give a baby a vaccine for a disease usually only seen in drug addicts)? Hep.B.
I would urge people not to be so fearful of common diseases IF you know you or your child has a strong immune system. You CAN test for immunity before vaccination. Vets are doing this for our pets more often now (if you request it), because of the question of vaccinosis. Because pets live shorter lives than humans,the effects of vaccine accumulation can be seen sooner, and some vets are changing their vaccine protocols, ""just to be on the safe side"", because they are concerned. Maybe we should demand as much from our doctors, for our precious children.

Honeycomb, your reply is wonderfully written and I agree wholeheartedly.  
mominashoe, actually the government did recently concede that autism was caused by vaccines in the case of Hannah Poling.  Look it up.  She is the daughter of a lawyer and a doctor who were able to put together a case that the government's best minds could not defeat, unfortunately for the rest of us, we are not all doctors and lawyers and vaccine court is not like other courts, but instead is biased against the public, but that is another whole long discussion...  By the way, what I'm referring to is that any damage as a result of any vaccine cannot be litigated in a regular court, you have to go to special ""vaccine court"". 
Also, pharmaceutical companies were supposed to voluntarily remove mercury from vaccines due to a government request and the possible link to autism and autism like disorders, however to date (August 2009) most vaccines continue to be made with mercury or forms of mercury which are marketed under other names such as thermiasol.  No matter the name or form of mercury it is a deadly neurotoxin and once it gets in the body it is nearly impossible to remove because of the way it binds to cells.   
I worked for a pharmaceutical company for many years, I know how they work.  I'm not saying that they are out to get anyone, but I will say that the objective of the company is profit profit profit, not necessarily the health of every patient.  Loss of or damage to some patients is viewed as acceptable and expected, the goal is high profits and low liability. Of course death or damage is acceptable as long as it's not a someone you care about. It's just a part of doing business. 
There are also some FACTS you need to understand about vaccines. I could write volumes as I have spent many years studying vaccines and the damage they can cause because I was injured by a vaccine, but that's another whole long story too. I'll limit myself to 7 important facts. Please, DON'T take my word for it, do the research yourself.  Google is a great resource. So is Dr Mercola's site. Go to a medical library at a med school.  You can read anything you like there and it's a fantastic resource.    
1.  The immunity gained from a vaccine is different than the immunity gained from the illness itself.  Illness provides lifetime immunity, vaccines only provide immunity for about 12 years or so.  (This is why I had the mumps and measles in my mid 20s although I had all the vaccines as a child.)  This has to do with the way the virus enters the body and the immune system reaction, as well as the way the vaccine was made and possible adjuncts added to the vaccine as well as the overall immune status of the patient at the time of the vaccine.  
2.  The reason certain illnessses are still around and show up is not because of nonvaccination, but instead BECAUSE of vaccination.  Most illnesses begin in populations of vaccinated individuals who have a poor immune response to the vaccine due to a poor immune status at the time of the vaccine.  In some cases, illnesses are brought back by the vaccinated from other countries.  (This is exactly how I got the mumps and measles.) These are just some examples but the numbers are well documented by the CDC. 
3.  Vaccine related reactions are believed (by the government and pharmaceutical companies) to be reported only about 10% of the time.  In reality it's much less. Students in med schools are told over and over they must vaccinate as much as possible and that injuries, including death, are most likely due to other causes.  By the way, it's often pharmacuetical companies telling students this as they hand out their complimentary textbooks and stethocopes in the new biology lab they just bought and paid for and ""donated"" to the school.  Young minds are the easiest and best to mold into the kind of thinking we want, yes, pharma people talk like that.  (FYI - I no longer work in pharma, my conscience would not allow me to continue working in pharma after I realized what we were doing, despite the huge sums of money they tried to give me.) 
4.  The flu shot does not and has never worked.  It's a pure money maker.  It's made a year in advance and they ""guess"" at what the strain will be.  In all the years that the flu shot has been out they've NEVER guessed right, not even once.  Maybe if they guessed right it would work, but to make the quantities needed they must work a year in advance.  The newest science suggests that the flu is caused, at least in part, by a seasonal vitamin D deficiency.  Studies are being done now which is looking at this.  Flu shots also contain mercury in some form. 
5.  Vaccine viruses are grown in various mediums such as human liver cells, chicken eggs, the cells of aborted fetuses, etc...  Very very few physicians have any idea of the originating medium of the vaccine they are administering - deliberately so by pharma companies.  Nobody knows the long term ramifications of injecting a toddler with say, aborted fetus cells (aka foreign DNA). (By the way this is how my husband and I both developed an egg allergy.)  Also many vaccines contain adjuvants which are added substances that are intended to turbo charge the immune response.  Some, like Squalene are quite dangerous and in Europe scientists believe it is a cause of MS and rhumatoid arthritis later in life, so they have been banned. The swine flu vaccine is a vaccine that has this particular adjuvant by the way.  
6.  A new possibility that is now starting to emerge is the possibility that vaccines, (something in the vaccines or something in the way the immune system responds to them) can actually cause cross generational harm.  In other words, as an example, a vaccine injury occurs in a generation which is too minor to be diagnosed, the next generation is born with an immune defect or disability of some kind which is not diagnosed and then more vaccines are given on top of that.  Then the next generation is born with more severe, more easily diagnosed condition.  This is an example to explain the concept but you see what the problem is.  
7.  Vaccines are a MAJOR source of income for pediatricians which is one reason why you will rarely find a doctor who will not promote them.  They are the most heavily promoted product to peds, particularly while they are still students.  
All of that said, there are some vaccines where the benefit outweighs the risk, however it is my opinion, (and the opinion of many other forward thinking physicians) that children should not be given vaccines until their bodies (immune system) are able to handle them and that they should be given vaccines on a more drawn out schedule vs the current government schedule.  I do not believe in giving children every single vaccine available or recommended by the government.  
Most important of all, I believe that all parents and patients should have a choice of what they put into their bodies.  Vaccines should not be mandated by the government nor should physicians bully parents or patients into having them. Every parents choice should be respected.   
It is a little known fact but every state allows for vaccine exemptions which any parent can obtain.  It's just a form to fill out and can be found on the web.

Hi,
My youngest of five just turned 2 and was observed by EI team (dev teacher &speech).  They observed him for an hour and said he qualifies for speech and special- ed (speech, social and cognitive deficiencies).  He came into the room with us, made eye contact, but really was in and out of the room.  He pushed his toy, went in the play room, came back, played with his trains but never really interested in interacting with the teachers.  He played the ""pick the toy"" game but got 2/3 wrong.  She said it looked inconsistent because he looked at the correct object but appeared to want the other.  For instance the bannana instead of juice cup. He stacked 4 blocks and then put them back in the bucket and dumped but got up and left again.
My question is that i told them he lined up toys and then ran along side them.  They didn't seem concerned.  I asked if they thought he was autistic and they said No, he made good eye contact and answered his name.  They said he didn't exhibit in the hour they watched him any typical autistic signs. I assume that means, toe-walking, flapping, twirling or any noticeable behaviors.
I think he is.  For instance, i have seen him walk by the stove handle and he turns his eyes to follow the handle or get really close to the cabinets.  I can call him and he immediately looks at me but its quirky.  You have to spend time with him to see him do it because its not like it happens all the time.  He also gets down to eye level to play with his cars and trains.
He has like 5 words but they are more sounds, Ugh oh, ank you (thank you), wow, rib-it, and he will make a ROAR sound for a lion.  He is constantly trying to talk to his brothers and sisters but its more like humming with inflection like his tongue isn't moving.  The speech path said physically their isn't anything wrong.  
He does play with his brother pushing a ball back and forth (great arm), he does follow the kids so he appears to enjoy them and he smiles and laughs alot.  He is an awesome sleeper and eater.  He know what to do with a phone and a comb when he gets his hands on them.
Should i call the developmental teacher back and stress my concerns or should i just go to a pediatric neurologist?  I want to get him help but the ""right"" help.  Also, do you think he will eventually speak even if he is autistic.

This is a tough one. My son saw paediatricians and neurologists from the age of two and they did not have a diagnosis for him. He too lined up toys but displayed no obvious traits of autism. It was however obvious that there was some kind of problem. It took his second grade teacher to insist on testing for autism as his doctor did not think he had it. Lo and behold, he was then diagnosed as autistic. Unfortunately he is intellectually delayed as well. You son may or may not be autistic. The fact that you are concerned about it is enough for me to suggest that you should consult a specialist doctor about it. Either he won't have it and you can set your mind at rest or he will and you can then get him the kind of help he needs. I think that would be a win-win situation. You know this child better than anyone so you need to have your concerns addressed. I never thought my son would speak, but he eventually started and now at eighteen years of age has an excellent vocabulary and he is hard to shut up. The autism spectrum is so wide that each child on it is so different. I advise you to follow your instincts and you won't go too far wrong. After all, you just want the best for your child.

Hi again and thanks.
If you were to look back and ask yourself, ""What were the thing(s) that you just knew made him autistic even when the dr's said no?"" 
I called the special ed teacher and she is telling me to wait on the specialist and give my son a chance to respond since there were many things that pointed no autism.
A new area for me which appears to be highly subjective.  Maybe with your experience and being able to look back maybe you can help me.
thanks again.

Hello, 
I am a Mental Health Nurse. Both my brother and sister have autism. Considering you are still questioning the evaluation of your sons' behaviour, I think it would be wise to seek further advice about your son. You are aware that this is not typical behaviour and it is wise of you to question their response. It certainly appears that your son has common characteristics of Autism. My brother also lines up cars, positioning each toy with precision with a great deal of time and focus. Swaying is also another common characteristic and speech and communication are the two most common traits of Autism.
However, at two years old, all children are developing at different rates, therefore it is impossible to be sure and could just be a delay in social development. I hope everything goes well for you and your son on your next meeting with the specialist.

Thanks bumblebeebounce.  Just today we met again and we went through goals and intervention services for speech and special ed.  I explained again that over the past month he doesn't line things up anymore but he is still running with a side gaze and dropping his head if he passes something in his path.  No percision or focus. Not sure why he stopped lining them up but he never cared about being exact, what type or how many.  He is pointing,waving,good eye contact.  He is approachable and will play for periods of time when engaged.  They agreed his running thing did appear to be a visual stim but that he isn't doing it alot and can be easily distracted and so many other things other than speech that saids no to autism.
I am skeptical.  I have an appointment with a neurologist next month but i think the special ed and early intervention team and my mom and husband will think i am nuts.  They seem confident he is not autistic.  They don't know that i made the appointment.  Should i go to relieve my worries or give the services time to work?  What would you do?

You made an appointment with the neurologist for next month out of instinct. To cancell this appointment may lead to being unsatisfied with the answers you have got from the specialist, and maybe regretting not having the last and final opinion, to put your mind at rest. 
If it is going to cause disagreement with the family, then i think it is something you just need to seek yourself, rather than telling your mum and husband (..unless of course you dont want to keep anything from them,).
I think (personally) the fact that he has stopped so many typical traits of autism is a big thumbs up. I hope the outcome confirms the best! Its looking good so far though. See what the services can achieve!

It took 3 mths for that appointment so like you said i may regret missing it and i need to do it for myself.  I will have 3 weeks of services by the time of his appointment so more input may be helpful.

729,could my little brother have aspergers syndrome?,"
I am 24 and i have a 6 year old brother that i see very rarely because we live in different states. While visiting for the past week i began to notice strange behavior that reminds me and one of my other relatives of a cousin i have with aspergers. he was never socialized around other children till he was almost five and it caused some issues with making friends and aggressive behavior. however it has been almost two years later and he still seems to have a very difficult time interacting with others, he has issues with aggression with other children at school and just appears to be awkward and out of place. he seems to me to be very introverted, he plays with his toys and often hums to himself and stays in his own world. he has interests in certain topics and on the rare occasions that he actually does carry on conversation with me he only seems interested in asking me random questions. he is having problems with reading in school, his teachers describe it as though he can read the words, but is unable to communicate them and understand them completely. i have noticed his coordination is not fantastic, although he is 6 so im not really sure how good that is supposed to be, but he tends to sway alot, like hes dancing almost. the aggression issue is still there as well, especially with animals and my 12 year old sister and my 2 year old daughter. my father has a 12 week old german shepard puppy that he constantly bothers and provokes, however when reprimanded for his behavior he justifies it by asking questions and saying he was doing the right thing and makes excuses for hurting the dog. it is as if he doesn't understand at all that what he is doing is wrong, so he will be reprimanded, and immeadiately go right back to what he was doing. he has violent outbursts towards my 12 year old sister. he is an extremely defiant and manipulative child from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed. i know that sounds terrible to say about a relative but that is literally what he is. he is a master manipultor. it is the odd behaviors that concern me though. i have read some symptoms of aspergers, i would just really like to have an outside opinion before i bring it up to my father who seems to be in denial of any issues.

Hi Mohito,
I am a teacher and I have had many students diagnosed with Autism and from what you wrote it sure does sound like it is possible.  My advice to you would be to take him to a child psychologist and have him evaluated.  Since you are out of state you might want to discuss this with your mom or dad.  If he is in a large school district where they deal with many different disabilities they will eventually take notice but it's better for him if he is diagnosed early.

I am a Mental Health Nurse, my brother has autism and my sister has Asperger syndrome. The characteristics of your brother do sound more like Autism. But to be sure, an evaluation i.e. questions relating to his behaviour on daily activities, will confirm your concerns. The questions are usually in point form and the number will signify whether there is a learning disibility. My dad was the same, always in denial, although i think it was more about coming to terms and accepting that his children had Autism and feeling a sense of guilt. However, today there is much help out there for children with Autism and Aspergers. Statistically, around 1 in 100 has Autism and it is most common in boys, the onset is more noticible around the age of 2-5 years old.

I don't think that these two things are enough to label a child as autistic. You need to look at other facets of his behaviour as well. Does he have obsessions, play beside other children rather than with them, make little or no eye contact with people, line up toys, get upset when habits are not adhered to or when the unexpected happens? There are lots of different signs of autism, I am only listing the ones my own exhibited as a young child. Do the neurologists have any other diagnosis or don't they know what the problem is? Google autism and study all the symptoms and then if your gut instinct still thinks it is relevant to your son, go with it and fight for a proper diagnosis. Best of luck to you and your son!

Hi there
I know it is very hard when you feel something is wrong with your child. I believe go with your gut instinct, if you feel something's wrong then most probably something is. Even though what you have described doesn't necessarily indicate Autism, it may indicate something else.
I'm having my daughter evaluated as she is demonstrating a few Autistic behaviours.
Some signs are as follows:
Flapping of hands.
Speech delays.
Resists cuddles/affection.
No or limited eye contact.
Doesn't interact in playtime (prefer to play alone).
Sensory Issues (dislikes some forms of touch).
Obsesses with unusual objects(may put the object very close to the face and seem to study it quiet intensly).
These are signs that my daughter is displaying. I know there are many more indications.
I absolutely believe you need to keep investigating the issue, one thing that my ped told me to is to record all of the unusual behaviour and take the recording to your next visit.
I hope this helps as I know exactly what it feels like to know something is wrong with your child. It's very distressing and a very emotional time.
Take care and I hope you get concrete results so that you can work to a wonderful future.

my 2 and a half year old son is not talking yet! 
he can only say mama but not all the time. he babbles but doesnt imitate to words you want him to say. what its frustrating is that, his not showing any interest of anything i m teaching him. he doesnt pay attention to what i say most of the time..his hearing was already tested.no problem was seen. 
now he is being assessed for autism. im just frustrated because i feel that im a failure...an incompetent mother who cant train a child to be a smart one. he knows nothing. cant even count. doest know his abc and colors too. 
even if i sing to him everyday, repeating the songs over and over again, he cant remember them. 
well, i taught him action songs and he does it sometimes...very seldom, i should say. 
but my son's so sweet. he kisses me and his dad and his baby brother always. he always gives me a hug. 
lately...he is potty trained but still with plenty of accidents.but his doing really great. 
my problem thats been bothering me is speech delay and a slight autism.

Your speech therapist is lying to you if he/she hasn't made the suggestion that it is perfectly normal for your child to be late in developing speech skills. Sure, it could be autism, but then it could also be a sign of a high IQ. Many highly intelligent people started life ""slow."" Some have even been misdiagnosed with autism before they proved that they were really just the opposite. And three times a week? That is ridiculous. There is absolutely no reason to go in more than once or twice a week for any kind of therapy, except maybe chemo. It's all about the money with most therapists, that's why a lot of them claim that therapy takes years when in reality they could potentially help you solve your problem in a matter of weeks or months. I know that from experience. I have never been able to understand more than a word or two from a 2-year-old's mouth. There are kids more than twice that age who are still very hard to understand, but they all get over it on their own.

Has anyone read The Horse Boy? It was a New York Times best-seller from a few years back-- it tells the story of a couple who go on a journey to Mongolia to visit several shamans in order to find a cure for their son's autism. Well, they videotaped the journey and now a documentary is being released in September that charts their experience. I'm not going to give anything away, but some pretty miraculous things happen. 
Considering what a big and current issue autism is in our society do you think that more people will turn to shamanism as a way of coping? This is a really interesting documentary and I'm very excited to see the reception it gets from both religious communities and medical communities alike. I saw the film at a film festival (it was at this year's Sundance Film Festival) and the audience seemed to love it.

Autism, which affects thought, perception and attention, is not just one disorder with a well defined set of symptoms; autism is a broad spectrum of disorders that ranges from mild to severe. In addition, the behavior usually occurs across many different situations and is consistently inappropriate for their age. 
In the diagnostic manual used to classify disabilities, the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), âautistic disorderâ is listed as a category under the heading of âPervasive Developmental Disorders.â A diagnosis of autistic disorder is made when an individual displays 6 or more of 12 symptoms listed across three major areas: social interaction, communication, and behavior. When children display similar behaviors but do not meet the criteria for autistic disorder, they may receive a diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorder-NOS (PDD not otherwise specified). 
Problems in social relatedness and communication. 
(Difficulty in mixing with other children; prefers to be alone; aloof manner; difficulty in expressing needs; uses gestures or pointing instead of words ). 
Abnormal responses to one or a 
combination of senses; such as sight, hearing, touch, balance, smell, taste, reaction to pain.
 
 Sustained odd play.
Uneven gross/ fine motor skills. 
Not responsive to verbal cues
acts as deaf. 
Little or no eye contact. 
Insistence on sameness; resist changes in routine.
Noticeable physical over activity or extreme under activity.
Tantrums; displays extreme distress for no apparent reason. 
Autism Resources 
Speech and language absence or delays. Inappropriate laughing and giggling. Echolalia (repeating words or phrases in place of normal language).
 Abnormal ways of relating to people, 
objects and events. (Inappropriate 
attachment to objects; don't seek cuddling ) 
Spins objects.
 
An aspect of language that tends to be disturbed in autistic people has to do with knowing how to use language appropriately and in context. That includes knowing how to hold a conversation, thinking about what the other person in a conversation understands and believes, and tuning in to the meta - linguistic signals of the other person, such as facial expression, tone of voice and body language. It is important to remember that communication is as much nonverbal as it is verbal, and autistic people have great difficulty understanding nonverbal language. 
The following is from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM IV): 
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR 299.00 AUTISTIC DISORDER
    A. A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), with at 
least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3) 
(1) qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: 
a) marked impairments in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body posture, and gestures to regulate social interaction 
b) failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to 
developmental level 
c) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people, (e.g., by a lack of showing, 
bringing, or pointing out objects of interest to other people) 
d) lack of social or emotional reciprocity ( note: in the 
description, it gives the following as examples: not actively 
participating in simple social play or games, preferring solitary 
activities, or involving others in activities only as tools or 
""mechanical"" aids ) 
(2) qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: 
a) delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language 
(not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) 
b) in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others 
c) stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic 
language 
d) lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social 
imitative play appropriate to developmental level 
(3) restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, 
interests and activities, as manifested by at least two of the 
following: 
a) encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in 
intensity or focus 
b) apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional 
routines or rituals 
c) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole body movements) 
d) persistent preoccupation with parts of objects 
B. Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: 
(1) social interaction 
(2) language as used in social communication 
(3) symbolic or imaginative play 
C. The disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett's Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder 
Diagnostic Criteria For 299.80 Asperger's Disorder 
Diagnosing and Evaluating Autism 
Autism and related disabilities, such as PDD-NOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified), and Asperger's Syndrome are difficult to diagnose, especially in young children where speech and reasoning skills are still developing. 
It is essential that the process of diagnosing Autism & related disabilities include the assessment and evaluation of a child's development, communication, and social skills. 
Evaluation and assessment are ongoing processes. Once a diagnosis has been reached, this process should be repeated periodically. 
We included brief descriptions of some medical tests and evaluations that may be ordered for children suspected of having autism or a related disability.

There are certain difference. Many people erroneously think that if you get better or are high functioning, you must be Aspergers. Individuals who have autsim, are delayed in their early language skills. Some do improve significantly. They usually perform significantly better on the nonverbal portions of IQ test, although in high functioning Autistic individuals the difference may not be as apparent.
Individuals with Aspergers usually do not have a delay in speech early on. Also, when you give them IQ tests, their verbal abilities are usually significantly higher than nonverbal abilities. 
In HFA, usually you will see more motor behaviors that involve self stemming. In Aspergers, motor clumsiness is more apparent.

There is no known single cause for autism, but it is generally accepted by the medical community that it is caused by abnormalities in brain structure or function. Brain scans show differences in the shape and structure of the brain in autistic versus non-autistic children. Researchers are investigating a number of theories, including the link between heredity, genetics and medical problems. While no one gene has been identified as causing autism, in many families there appears to be a pattern of autism or related disabilities, further supporting a genetic basis to the disorder.

It took about nine years before my son was diagnosed with autism. What threw even the doctors off was the fact that he was an extremely loving, friendly child who loved hugs and loved everybody, even strangers! He did have some pretty bad tantrums, but when he was good he was a real angel. He is a teenager today and hasn't changed much, but it took a schoolteacher to recognise the autism and push for proper testing. The autism spectrum is so wide that it can be very difficult to see where a child fits on it.

760,Autism Myths,"
A diagnosis of autism is not the end of love and hope. But media stories thrive on the most overwhelming and horrifying circumstances. Here are just a few of the myths perpetuated by TV, magazines and movies -- myths that, at least in my opinion, deserve to be blown away!
1. Autistic People Are All Alike
Myth: If Iâve met an autistic person (or seen the movie Rain Man), I have a good idea of what all autistic people are like.
Fact: Autistic people are as different from one another as they could be. The only elements that ALL autistic people seem to have in common are unusual difficulty with social communication. 
2. Autistic People Don't Have Feelings 
Myth: Autistic people cannot feel or express love or empathy.
Fact: Many -- in fact, most -- autistic people are extremely capable of feeling and expressing love, though sometimes in idiosyncratic ways! What's more, many autistic people are far more empathetic than the average person, though they may express their empathy in unusual ways. 
3. Autistic People Don't Build Relationships
Myth: Autistic people cannot build solid relationships with others.
Fact: While itâs unlikely that an autistic child will be a cheerleader, it is very likely that they will have solid relationships with, at the very least, their closest family members. And many autistic people do build strong friendships through shared passionate interests. There are also plenty of autistic people who marry and have satisfying romantic relationships. 
4. Autistic People Are a Danger to Society
Myth: Autistic people are dangerous.
Fact: Recent news reports of an individual with Asperger Syndrome committing violent acts have led to fears about violence and autism. While there are many autistic individuals who exhibit violent behaviors, those behaviors are almost always caused by frustration, physical and/or sensory overload, and similar issues. Itâs very rare for an autistic person to act violently out of malice. 
5. All Autistic People Are Savants
Myth: Autistic people have amazing âsavantâ abilities, such as extraordinary math skills or musical skills.
Fact: It is true that a relatively few autistic people are âsavants.â These individuals have what are called âsplinter skillsâ which relate only to one or two areas of extraordinary ability. By far the majority of autistic people, though, have ordinary or even less-than-ordinary skill sets. 
6. Autistic People Have No Language Skills
Myth: Most autistic people are non-verbal or close to non-verbal.
Fact: Individuals with a classic autism diagnosis are sometimes non-verbal or nearly non-verbal. But the autism spectrum also includes extremely verbal individuals with very high reading skills. Diagnoses at the higher end of the spectrum are increasing much faster than diagnoses at the lower end of the spectrum. 
7. Autistic People Can't Do Much of Anything
Myth: I shouldnât expect much of an autistic person.
Fact: This is one myth that, in my opinion, truly injures our children. Autistic individuals can achieve great things -- but only if they're supported by people who believe in their potential. Autistic people are often the creative innovators in our midst. They see the world through a different lens -- and when their perspective is respected, they can change the world.

We are talking about a REMOTE possibility here. If every parent did that, the human race would die out. And it isn't up to society at large to decide: it's up to the parents who in this case are so loving and so generous, and they want a child so badly, they would love him no matter what happened and provide for him all their days. It's more than I can say for many who have perfectly healthy children who leach from and are a burden on society because they are too lazy to do the right thing.
I want to thank the OP for the original post. I have another set of vaccinations coming up, and because of the supposed relation that they have with autism, I always freak out.

The product goes from freezer to oven, and Iâve found it a huge help to have this option in the kitchen.  Hope the info/ brief review helps.  Happy New Year!

779,Possible autism ?,"
I have an 11 year old son that was born with complications due to CMV (Cytomegalovirus). Because of this he has Deafness, Slight CP on left side, Grey matter brain damage and we suspect possibly some sort of autism.
He prefers to play by himself when with other kids. He will interact at times. When he plays with block he will sort them all by shape and color. Also line them all up in a straight line smallest to biggest. Playing cars means lining them up side by side so the front ends make a perfect line. When younger, while shopping, if he sees a display set up wrong he would lign it up and put the same items together. He still does that some times. His schedule has to be the same every day. If you tell him something will happen at a certain time he becomes a clock watcher and will annoy you when time come close. If the time passes and what ever was motioned does not happen he will through a fit. Everything he does has to be in a neat ordered fashion. His homework is always laid out the exact same way when he does it. Changing his routine brings on the risk of fit throwing. That is just some of it. 
For the most part he is very friendly to strangers and there are not many people he dislikes. He will initiate interaction with strangers. When he decides he does not like someone he will through a fit when he knows he will have to be around that person. If things really get out of place or just dont go his way he will become violent. Throwing things, yelling and hitting. The communication barrier of ASL and english does present a problem when this happens. Thankfully technology has presented a way for us to communicate with him in those times. Once things do calm down it will be to him like nothing happened. 
We do intend to seek medical if this is indeed not normal behavior for his age. I talk with his school to see if similar things happen there. I am told they do but not often. Mainly because school has structure and certain things happen at certain times. there is rarely deviation. At home with 3 siblings there will almost always be deviation from any structure we try to impose. All of his routine stuff is created and maintained by him. Sometimes he will try to get the siblings involved in what he is doing or pretending. Mostly he is doing his own thing. 
I could keep going but dont want to make post to long. From what I have described what do you guys think. Does it sound like I may be dealing with some sort of autism?
Thanks

My psychiatrist said my son could not be autistic if he is social at all.  If your son makes friends and eye contact, then he is not autistic.  
However, I would get your son evaluated.  There could be a learning disability.  My son was diagnosed at age 2 with Receptive Language Disorder.  He also had hearing problems.

My son who is 4 yrs old can be very social and loves to cuddle and hug people. He has Autism, ADHD and possible Bi Polar. He can make friends and he will play with them at times. I don't think that they can base Autism on being Social. My son was always a lover and he has been seen by alot of different Docs and Specialist who all agree he has Autism. I myself questioned the Social issue and they told me that every child is different just because some are not social and some are does not change the fact that they have Autism. I think if your at all having concerns I would ask for a Evaluation. We were lucky enough that a Hospital 1 1/2 hours from us did a 3 day Arena Assessment where 6 to 9 different doctors, therapist and professionals examine and interact with your child and the 3rd day they sit you down and everyone in the room explains their findings and give you a diagnosis or suggest further testing. It was the best way for me to understand what the findings were and I would do it again even though we had to drive 3 hours a day for the testing. I would try a Developmental Pediatrician or a Neurologist with Autism experience as a place to start.
My son never sorted objects by color or shape, he never had a meltdown if I changed his schedule. I think some of the things you are questioning are classic signs of Autism and I would get it checked. I am not a Doc so I can not say but somethings you listed are listed as signs of Autism. It will not hurt to get him Evaluated.

783,Possible autism ?,"
No, I doubt your son has autism. An autistic child wouldn't care about extreme neatness and wouldn't interact with society. And ASL is naturally very communicative in and of itself.
Your son has OCD, which explain his inability to deal with change and his extreme desire to make everything perfect. He has a extreme desire for control, which is why he throws fits so easily when things don't go his way.
When he does his homework, does he erase his work if it isn't handwritten perfectly? Does he double-check his answers many times? Does he care about what grade he gets to a huge degree?
OCD patients interact with people fine, but his desire for control may be the causation of his throwing a fit with people he doesn't like (which, in turn, would make this person go away).
This is not normal behavior for a child, and you should definitely NOT give in when he throws fits. That just gives your child control and this sort of behavior will set in stone soon. Obviously, an adult throwing fits isn't acceptable in society.
I'm not a doctor though, and I'm just a college freshman who only recently passed Intro to Psychology. Ask a real psychologist about it, and research treatment for OCD.
Also, good news is that OCD is much milder disorder than Autism. However, I do think that his brain/deafness/CMV has ALOT to do with it, but to which extent I'm not sure.

784,Possible autism ?,"
It is possible.  My son has PDD-NOS.  It is also considered to be high-functioning autism.  He interacts with people, but has a low threshold for things that deviate from what he expects.  He can have very violent tantrums at times, and his play has always involved things being in a certain order with a very fixed fascination with animals and dinosaurs.  A child psychologist/psychiatrist, or a developmental pediatrician, or even a developmental neurologist can be very helpful.  There are many types of autism that have varying symptoms/characteristics, as well as other disorders that have similar characteristics.  Good luck in your search for answers.

793,risperdone and blood work,"
Hi,
My 11 year old son is severely autistic and has been taking risperdone medication for 10 wks now.  He needs to have some bloods taken.  Ive been really stressed out about it as ive prepared him with a social story of what will happen when we go the hospital but as soon as he seen the pictures he started getting anxious and shouting ""no hospital"" and i could definitely see him raging about this before we even get out the door.  Ive shown him and told him after the hospital he can have a choose.... well that just makes things worse and i really cant see him complying at all.  He has never had to have any injections for anything so i dont know what to do but we have not gone today.  
Psychiatrist appointment is tomorrow for check up and see how he is doing on the med.  He takes 0.5mg daily.
Just to ask could the injections been done at a later time if his check up- weight, heart rate and blood pressure are fine?
Any advice appreciated.

As a mother of 3, it sounds like his daytime crying is mostly frustration and developmentally normal.
About the nightime...not one of my 3 kids slept through the night until they were 22 mos. or older.  And even after that they still woke sometimes, even a few times at night here or there until they were around 4 years old.  My solution was the family bed.  If they woke crying I would pat them back to sleep or nurse them if they were still nursing.  A lot better than getting up to go to a child's room 1/2 awake.  It used to make me insane too...and exhausted.  But anyone who tells you that's not normal has probably put their little ones through ""crying it out"" or some form of sleep training.  I don't personally agree with that, I'd rather just ride out this rough time.  My 12, 8 and 4 year old sleep great and are very secure and loved because I sacrificed for them when they were younger and more demanding.
You will survive and this difficult time will be a distant memory.  My advice is to find a mom's group/playgroup/playdates with other moms who share your viewpoint.  This is a time when you need support.  Nobody tells you this when they are younger but the under 2 age is hard as all.  It is probably the hardest time of your life.  But the older they get the easier it gets.  
Great books on tantrums and sleeping through the night are by William Sears, the baby book etc.  He is a Christian Pediatrician whose wife is a lactation specialist and they have over 7 kids.  Hang in there...you can do it.

Deb

I hear you loud and clear!  First I want to ask you, is crying the only symptom he has? My son cried insessantly from about the age of 6mos or so to 4 years old. (I went on antidepressant medication because I went into major depression). But there were other symptoms, holding him wouldn't soothe him (like a normal baby crying), when he would look at you he would just seem to be looking ""through"" you or ""past"" you, His language development was late. 
My doctor told me all was normal, but it was not...at the age of 12 he was diagnosed with PDD-nos (not Aspergers or Autism but on the Autistic Spectrum) He had and still has semantic pragmatic disorder (also on the spectrum) These children find it more difficult to extract the central meaning or the saliency of an event. They tend to focus on detail instead; for example the sort of child who finds the duck hidden in the picture but fails to grasp the situation or story in the picture or the child who points out the spot on your face before saying 'hello'. 
Don't leave it too long, however the sleep habits should improve (though I always found my son to be the lightest sleeper and seem to require alot less sleep than our other son.

Here is another thought - My oldest son cried and cried. Nothing would comfort him. I finally figured out it was his tummy. He was breast fed exclusively so it wasn't an allergy to a formula. His belly just hurt him. He had gas and was in pain. Gas drops helped tremendously. You could give it a try as simethicone (gas drops) are benign and won't hurt your baby.
Is there any possibility that your little guy is in pain? 
3 of my 4 boys had colic. I know how you feel. Car rides and putting the car seat on top of the dryer with the baby in it and turning  on the dryer can soothe a little one. 
Georgia59 is right. You need a break from this. See if anyone would watch him for you so you can take a walk, run to the store, just get away for a bit.
If you are not satisfied with the answers the doctor is giving you then find another doctor. Crying like this is not the norm. You know your baby so don't doubt yourself. Keep looking - the answers are out there.

I'm sorry to hear you haven't slept for sooo long. I had a lot of problems with my son from about 2 - 6 months. We took him to the doctor literally every week, and we kept hearing that he was a little colliky. We ended up giving him lactose free milk, which helped tremendously. But what I found to be the most helpful thing was a sound machine, which he still uses. The brand is Homedics. I turn that on when goes to sleep at night and when he takes naps. Without that he doesn't sleep as long or as good. There are different sounds and all. Since he's been sleeping better, he is very well rested and rarely cries. I'm not sure this will help, but it's just an idea. Sometimes the vacuum cleaner is great too. Have you tried that?
Good luck and try to find a way to get some rest.

Hi...
Does your son show any other Autistic signs, my son screamed, cried like he was in agony from teething and i used to medicate panadole from the age 16monthes.... however it was the frustration of not being able to communicate... we had him fully diagnosed by the age of 2.5years.. however we were told from the age of 18monthes it was leaning towards Austism...
Maybe you should get your son assessed...my advice is if your gut feeling is telling somthing is not right than its probely not...and the most important thing is to take care of yourself....

812,Synaesthesia or high-functioning autism ?,"
I don't have an extensive appointment with my family doctor until the 15th so this is mainly out of personal concern/curiosity. 
This paragraph I posted in the General Q&A section but I feel I have to elaborate on it a bit more and perhaps by doing so, I think it fits here as well.
I'm a twenty-one year old Male living in Ontario Canada and have been the odd ball my whole life but in the last month and a half my elevated mood (Got a lot sorted out in my life) has made my Synaesthesia -far- more pronounced.
Counting, memory, math skills...they're all changing for me dramatically at an increasing rate.
At first it was making me do Two-digit x Two-digit multiplication just to calm myself down to get to sleep. Now I can 'sleep inside' any of the numbers I want and I can basically pass out as my head hits the pillow Smile
It's been doing -only- good for my life so far. My memory has improved dramatically to the point where I can go through my entire day..or my entire day three days ago. You get the point.
Is this common with synaesthesia to progress with maturity?
So why do I think this has a relation to autism? I was very isolated when I was a child and especially into my teens. As much as I could connect with people when I wanted to I just wanted my own little room and all the books I could get my hands on. I ended up getting pushed along the road of life by my fantastic mom as well as my friends to put me in what most would consider a 'Normal life' for myself.
I had plenty of emotional baggage to keep me occupied when I was young. My father beat my mom and not only did I remember that vividly my entire life (I was two) my brother had no recollection of it since he was very young and we are two very different people.
I always wanted to succeed at everything so I poured myself into everything that wasn't my emotional baggage. I was the star student at presentations, computers..art..you name it. I always suffered in school though because I passed all my courses on pure comprehension alone and near 0% of my assignments were completed. I'd just pour what I knew into tests or presentations instead.
I'd drown boredom out sometimes by playing my favorite songs over and over in my head...note by note. But I figured everyone was capable of doing it on that level. As I got older I noticed this was definitely not the case.
Most of my friends are what a lot of people would consider ""Nerds"" and most (as well as I) am proud of it. However I'm not interested in any one particular subject. I enjoy physics as much I love movies/games/science/history/art/culture/l
anguage/geography/astronomy and I just grew to accept that was my nature as I got older.
Recently the situation in the household put me in a really revealing conversation with my mom that sort of confirmed everything I was thinking about her boyfriend and his step-son..which I thought was all in my head for the past few years. 
The weeks that followed I noticed my concentration was shifting to a more 'happy' focus. All the things that bothered me in my life seemed to all fit into place. I'd always lived in numbers but couldn't keep my eyes open in a math class after doing the problem the first time. Now I walk by buildings and know instantly how many windows there are..how many rivets. I feel like drawing them all recently but I've always managed to keep my sketchpads pretty full.
I've been able to grasp more of the Japanese I'd been studying the last few months as well. Obviously these things have all been for the better and I feel a lot more confident in myself as a result. I just want this appointment to be over so I can just get on with it 
For just a small example of how much better my life has been on a daily basis, words and letters all have defined colors now as well as being able to memorize virtually anything. Just looking for some guidance or re assurance because it's been some what overwhelming emotionally.

personally i wouldnt worry untill you get an official diagnosis. I also personally think that you are a very smart young man with a lot on your mind. i think that is normal---just try to relax and erase your mind a little--then you will be able to sleep.
as for knowing how many rivets etc. it could be something or it could be very good attention to detail. id check with your doctor when you get to see him and not give it another thought till then. no use worrying

My son is 7 years old and sometimes I think he is 2. He has an attatchment to me. Not every day but a lot of days he has a hard time going to school. He will be heading to the bus and all the sudden turn around with a look of panic and refuse to get on the bus. I end up taking him to school and when we get there I will have to drag him out of the car and hand him over to the teacher while I drive away. The whole time he is screaming for me. He was held back from Kindergarten from his severe shyness, so counting preschool this is his 4th year in school. He has days that he is fine. But he has days that end up being miserable for both of us. He does it other places also like the gym. But only to me. He also still has problems pooping in his pants. I don't know if this is related to whatever is wrong with him or not but he knows how to go to the bathroom. No matter where he is (at home, a friends house, school...). He will go a few months with no accidents and then he will start doing it again everyday. I don't know what to do with him anymore. We have tried every angle of stopping this behavior but nothing is working. Any suggestions?

He only does this with you, right?? 
I have seen this a lot in the school setting. Does he have psychosomatic (physical symptoms) when it's a school day??? There are so many questions I want to ask but so much I still wouldn't know.
 I would ask for a meeting with the school and include the school psychologist, school counselor, teacher, principal. If they have an intervention team, request to have a meeting with all of them. This is certainly not new to them and they may have some ideas of what is going on. Please try not to go about this alone. The school team would love to work with you in trying to help your son.
If this is true school phobia, there is hope but it may just take some time.   
I have some ideas I will write more later.  
I am back:
At least for school, try to have the mornings as consistent as possible. Kids with anxiety often feel  out of control internally and if you have a consistent routine in the morning, it helps them to know exactly what to expect and they often feel more in control. It may not be the cure at all but it may help to alleviate some anxiety that she may be having. That routine should be taken on the school level as well. When she first arrives at school, there should be someone that sees her off before she starts school. For example, right when she gets to school she can check in with the school counselor. Also the teacher should consider developing  a ""special task"" for her to do every morning. That way, she will have something to look forward to and it is consistent. She will get the one on one time with the teacher and may feel more connected at school. It most likely will help her get her mind off of leaving you and the ""what will happen today"" feeling. Even though school is on a specific routine, there are many things that our beyond control. This may help her feel more in control. 
Oh, when she leaves you in the morning - try so hard not to have any reaction. It is so hard, I know. If she senses your anxiety about her anxiety or her leaving, it will cause her anxiety to be worse. It is best to leave ASAP. In the gym, the same thing. Don't stick around. Just leave. Find out how she responded a few minutes after you left. She may be just fine. Although, there is a possibility she still could have the internal anxiety that is so very real.
Is her anxiety affecting her academic performance. If so, please please initiate a meeting with the school personal ASAP to develop an action plan similar to the possibilities I mentioned above. 
Honestly, I think what you are going through is one of the toughest things a parent can go through. I think it's great you are trying to do something. Please let us know what happens.

My son does only do this with me. He never has a hard time with his father or grandparents. We are requesting a meeting with his teacher. He is extremely shy in school. In fact they school forced us to hold him back from kindergarten because of it. This year he is in first grade. His 4th year in school and his teacher called me about 2 months into the year for advice on how to get him to talk. First quarter of school he brought home 2 a's and 1 c on his report card. 2nd quarter he brought home 1 c and 2 d's. He knows that if he fails he will be in 1st grade with his sister next year but he doesn't seem to care. At home he won't sit still. He stands while he eats so he can move around. He won't focus on his studies. He is having troubles learning to read because he is too busy worrying about wanting a glass of milk or what his sister is doing... I don't know if it is some sort of anxiety or ADHD or a mixture of both. Anxiety runs in his father's side of the family. I took him to a psychologist a few years ago and he talked to him for about 10 minutes, of course my son wouldn't talk to him, and he decided that he needed to be on zoloft. We had him take it for a few days but saw a reverse affect so stopped it.  We also stopped letting him have caffeine. It seems after he has soda he gets very angry and violent. I hate seeing my little boy so sad and angry all of the time. We are trying to figure it out.

I would request a meeting with the school team not only the teacher, if you feel comfortable. The school psychologist and team have most likely dealt with this before and have ideas. 
The more people, the more insight you all will get! 
It seems that a lot of kids with severe anxiety and/or school phobia do that primarily with mom. Mom is safety, she is comfort. Everything else is stressful and full of anxiety. This doesn't surprise me at all. 
 
While you are trying to figure it out, I would definitely try some of the ideas mentioned above. Especially try having a person to check in with  him every morning. Perhaps after a while, he could have that one special person with whom he has developed some rapport with. 
I would personally request a full psychoeducational evaluation. Get in touch with your school psychologist. At least, it could provide you with a little more information to go on. Even if you don't want to go down the whole special education route, it would provide some information to a doctor or therapist who may work with him in the future.I would want to rule out any possible learning disabilities as well. Even if you don't suspect it, it's always good to rule out. 
Good luck to you, You are definitely headed in the right direction. Your little boy will get the help he needs as long as everyone is working together as a team. You are doing great there mom. 
I also would find a clinical child psychologist. Not necessarily a counselor until you pinpoint what is going on.

Well I took him to the doctor today and discussed the issues with her. At first she wanted to say it was normal behavior but she watched him the whole time and quickly decided that he needs to be tested by a psychologist. We aren't going to diagnose anything yet but she thinks he probably has ADHD, with  the AD stronger than the hyperactivity. He is very fidgety and wiggles and bites his nails. Anything to be moving. I talked with his teacher and the other lady that works with him and they said the same thing.

Im glad you went to see a doctor, dont let them label him ADHD right away. Especially if they want to medicate! Rarely works out well and the adults I know that were given drugs as children for adhd are not so happy about it now. 
I was very ""shy"" also and would panick at any kind of performance I had to give or group activity. I realized in my twenties that this started after a move 6 states away at age 7. I lost my confidence I didnt fit in right away like at home, from north to the south. But I had no idea I was having these feelings at the time I was to young to understand. Well I also finally realized the ""shyness"" had been social anxiety all along and I still suffer from it today at 32 only I finally know what it is and just make myself get through it. He needs to learn techniques to talk himself down from panicking. Just to cover all the bases maybe you could look into anxiety as a cause. Before you cancel everything out aside from adhd which is suspicously diagnosed a lot. You can treat that without meds.

This sounds identical to my neighbour's son who was also held back a year because he refused to comply with anything he was asked to do in class (at age 5!) and often just went to sleep under a desk!  He also screamed the place down every time his mother left him at school and his parents could not go out and leave him with a babysitter as he would try to escape from the house to go and find them.  He was diagnosed with separation anxiety, ADHD, dyslexia (!) , autism and finally asperger's syndrome.  He was given a classroom assistant to help him with the little tasks he could not do alone (the ones that everyone had assumed he was deliberately doing badly eg toileting, reading etc) and the transformation was unbelievable.  We now see a happy little boy playing in the garden - sometimes alone, for he is still rather 'shy' - but always smiling.  He is apparently very happy at school, now he knows it is not a threatening place.
I am not suggesting that your child has Asperger's but he may have a specific need which needs to be addressed by the school.

I am not going to let the doctor automatically diagnose him with ADHD. The doctor wants to send him to the psychologist to have all the test done. I do believe that there is a lot of anxiety in him also. It seems as though he has more AD then hyperactivity. But I talked to his teacher today and she said that in class he wiggles, bites his nails, sits on his feet, anything to be moving. And at home he is the same way. It took him over an hour to read a 6 page story tonight. Just because he can't focus. He is laying down and kicking his feet, and wiggling around, fidgeting with everything he can find. I am not going to jump to conclusion but it is tearing me down. I don't know how much longer I can deal with it, plus the stress of working ( I am a portrait photographer so I deal with other peoples children all day). I am trying to get through it but it has been going on for too long. So anyway, we are hoping we can get through this without medication but we will have to see.

Von Willebrand's disease is a coagulation disorder caused by genetic defect. Genetic defect causes lack of the Von Willebrand's factor which is important for the blood coagulation. This condition is treated with crioprecipitate (blood derivate) that contains the missing coagulation factor. Easier forms of this disease are treated with desmopresin or epsilon-aminocaprone acid which stimulate production of Von Willebrand's factor.

Hi there,
I was actually looking around to see what information was out there on people with ITP using Transfer Factor and stumbled upon this website.
ITP is an auto-immune definiciency disorder which makes your body destroy your own platelets. In other words, a bleeding disorder. I was diagnosed with ITP at the age of 16. I had taken Prednisone, done different blood fusion treatments, and was even at the risk of having my spleen removed until I found Transfer Factor. I currently take Transfer Factor and have been in remission since I started taking it two years ago. It has been great. I have been able to stop doing anything like Prednisone and blood fusions. 
I actually have lots of information on Transfer Factor, so if you would like some more, feel free to write me.

857,frequent vocal and body ticks,"
Hey I'm almost 19 years old (Male) and in the past year some things have not been quite right.
I'm sorta having tourette like symptoms however I am no expert so i'll just list the symptoms that are currently occuring.
Random ticks happening very frequently (Once a minute or even more).
They're either just a vocal whelp or a full body tick.
They happen spontaneously and it's as though I feel I have to do them basically for relief, I feel calm after they've happened until the next minute (usually less actually).
When I hear a stupid immature word that agitates me or an annoying habit I dislike, these ticks start happening once every couple of seconds for 15 seconds or so, the vocal and body ticks at this point are usually combined.
It also happens a lot when I'm just lying in bed and it's stuffing up my sleep pattern. I can control it rather well around friends and people in general but I feel not at ease in this situation. It's as though I just wanna let it all out. (When I do let it all out it just comes back a minute later).
Any ideas what's wrong with me? 
This never happened until I was 17 and there's no family history regarding anything like this.

Oh btw forgot to mention  (Can't edit previous post).
At 15 I was sorta diagnosed with Aspergus syndrome.
The phyciatrist I was seeing said I had certain symptoms that were evident but not really enough to call it a diagnosis.
I think my dads the same, he seems to get angry a lot and most of his arguments end up turning into nonsensical self pity drivel (However he does have a lot of stress).
My symptoms were strange eye activity, shyness and mild social issues.
Given my past a lot of people put it as a misdiagnosis which made me relieved.
However these current symptoms I am experiencing clearly display that there is something wrong.

No- developmental disorders are present from birth and though there may be a definitive point where a parent thinks ""something is wrong,"" it was always there.
If a child is different one day like you described, that sounds more like some kind of psychological trauma, not a developmental disorder.
",http://ehealthforum.com/health/topic129538.html,91919,870
876,questions about autism,"
Like Tmddyan said, it is not autism, it may be something else.  My brother is autistic and although it does affect everyone differently, it is unheard of for a kid to be fine one day and wake up the next morning with a loss of all of his skills.  It is my younger brother who is autistic, and I remember him never acting like a regular kid when he was a baby.  First of all, he never played, ever.  Secondly, if you have a younger brother then you know that kids really like toys when they are young.  Instead of toys, my younger brother, Jack, liked to play with pieces of other things.  He carried around a piece of a wooden duck, and that was what he liked and wanted.  Anyway though, in answer to your question, my brother is autistic, and so I know a lot of parents of autistic people.  No story has ever been mentioned about a kid waking up one day and being autistic.  That is unheard if, and, I would say impossible, but I am not a neurologist so I don't know.  But what I do know is that like Georgia59 said, most developmental disorders are there from birth.

879,Update on my son,"
It sounds like you will have a lot of information next friday. Basically, when you do see  the psychiatrist, s/he will review the information and agree or disagree with the psychologist's findings.  Most of the time they agree with the psychologist because the evaluation is very comprehensive. 
I think it's great you are doing this when he is so young. It will make it a lot easier to meet his educational needs with this information. Whatever his dx ends up being (if any), I can mail you a great deal of information related to that dx and the educational system in general. 
We have talked about this before regarding my son. If your son ends up having Aspergers then I have some great information for you provided by the speech pathologist at my school. She is the ""asperger and autism"" guru of the school district and I highly respect her. 
When the psychologist goes over the information, it may be a little daunting. S/he may discuss all these different tests and subtests and may go over standard scores. If it becomes confusing, just pm me and I will go over it more with you. 
Even if you are expecting a specific dx, if that dx is confirmed for you don't be surprised if you still feel a flood of emotions. The emotions could occur for a variety of reasons such as confirmation, worry, confusion, relief, etc. I experienced that personally and I had no doubt in my mind what the clinical psychologist was going to tell me. Honestly, I wasn't expecting to have so many emotions when we met with the clinical psych. I already knew the information but it was still so very hard. 
The one thing I can tell you about children with Aspergers - they are my FAVORITE to work with!! Most are so funny and have great senses of humor. I am current reading a book called, ""Freaks, Geeks and Aspergers Disorder,"" written by a boy when he was just 13 years old. It is  such a great book.

893,Stress overload and pounding heart,"
Hello. I am seeking help because I do not know where else to go. I am 18 years old right now, and I am a full time college student majoring in nursing. I also work 2 jobs (about 28 hours per week) as a nurse's assistant for mentally challenged and autistic children.
When I was 16 my mother moved away and I had nowhere to live so since then I have been living with my boyfriend (who is now 21.) He lives about an hour and a half away from my college, so each day I drive an hour and a half to school, go to class all day, then drive to work and work till about 9:30 at night and then go home and do homework for an hour and go to bed.
I am so busy all the time, that I have lost alot of friends and the only person I ever really socialize with is my boyfriend.
The problem is, that I am so stressed out everyday. From the moment I wake up till the moment I fall asleep my heart is pounding, and I am constantly stressing out about everything.
Especially in my car, since I do so much driving and I am thinking thinking the whole time- I get so stressed out that I often throw up and I cry everyday, at least once or twice.  After a long day of feeling stressed out, I turn to feeling just drained, and sad and just cry and cry until I fall asleep.
I am trying so hard to get somewhere and make myself something, but I feel so alone and so stressed out all the time that it is really staggering me.
Help me please.

Wow that's a pretty heavy work load.  What you are feeling is normal under your circumstances.  If you were in a better situation, you would probably not have any anxiety-related symptoms, so this is a good thing.  Good meaning that you do not have medically related anxiety.
Just read what you put up there.  Who can do that much and still be sanely human?  Two jobs, full time college, and living with a boyfriend that is over an hour away.  So that's like having three or four jobs at the same time.  You probably need the jobs for college and you can't give up college because that is your future.
Is there any way that you could convince your boyfriend to move closer or get a place of your own that is closer?  That's three hours every day that you are missing....time that could be used for sleep or for study.
If you don't want to change this lifestyle, which I'm guessing you don't because you would have if you really wanted to, then what I suggest is using that long drive to your benefit.  Use it as your relaxation time.  Your time for YOU.  Get some fun music, buy some inspirational tapes.  Drive with the windows down and sing at the top of your lungs.
I'm sorry no one got to this post sooner, but I do hope that this helps you out a little.  You are so young and have so much of a load for your age.  The best of luck to you!

Katrina, I think you're absolutely right about the antibiotics.  It's not a good idea to take them unless absolutely necessary.  Doctors sometimes prescribe them 'just in case' so it's little wonder we have such a problem with bacteria becoming resistant.  My son has never had antibiotics yet and he's nearly three.  He was prescribed them once as the doctor wasn't sure if he was going to get an infection or not and the surgery was going to be shut for a couple of days.

I have never been one to go to the doctors either.  Unless absolutely necessary.  I firmly believe that doctor's and hospitals are too quick to give meds when all a person really needs is some good old fashioned R & R to get feeling well again.  
Obviously I would bring my kids to the doc if they appeared to be ill.  
I think there are conflicting stories in regards to immunizations being linked to Autism.  I know when I researched it it was found to possibly be the mercury in the vaccines that was the culprit.  I honestly don't know.  
I do know that as much of a struggle it would be to raise a child with Autism, I would hate to see my child suffer with polio, measles, mumps, rubella.  If people stop immunizing their children we may end up with another outbreak.  
Mumps has been seen recently.  It just isn't a risk I would want to take, when those diseases are preventable.

I hope you homeschool your children if you don't vaccinate them.  It's your choice but it's also a public health issue and can affect what's known as ""herd immunity"".  Booster shots are required as we grow older to re-strengthen the resistance to diseases.  Those who are not vaccinated have a higher risk of contracting diseases and thus giving them bodies to reproduce and mutate in, which in turn puts the rest of the community at risk through exposure.
Vaccinated children can contract viruses from unvaccinated children without actually contracting the resulting illness, but they go home to their parents and older family members whose resistance isn't as strong and expose them to it as well.  Pregnant women and cancer patients are especially vulnerable to illnesses.  The same flu that could put your child on bedrest could also put other people in the hospital or kill them.
You can research which ones are suspected to cause autism and be selective but it's important to avoid an epidemic by reducing the number of viruses your children could contract, mutate and spread through the population.
I think that if humankind doesn't kill each other off first, a disease epidemic spread through carelessness will.

It sounds like autism but i cant be sure. Have they given her any kind of diagnosis at all? I think that the jerking in her sleep is the seizures.
I think that what you need to do is to relax.  
 Do you know why she throws the tempertantrums? If its just because  you can just ignore them. and they will eventually stop.Ill have to warn you that the temper tantrums may get worse before they lessen. dont give in or else you reinforce a stronger tantrum.   Do you have anything that she really likes that you can reward her for being good with? LIke something to look forward to. for instance plan an activity that she really likes to occur after school so she has something to look forward to.

My son was diagnosed with ""receptive Language disorder"" when he was 2 years old.  He was not yet speaking at this time and our pediatrician noticed it during a routine checkup.  Anyway he underwent a series of testing and he received quite a bit of therapy during his first 2 grades of school.  By the time he was in Grade 3 they stopped all therapy.  He seems to be doing well, but my concern now is that he is 18 and about to graduate high school.  He is having trouble finding a job and I really don't think he can handle being out on his own.

What were his grades like in school? Did the teachers have concerns with his academics? What about social skills? Have they mentioned that he doesn't seem to understand what they are saying or asking? Have you noticed that he has difficulty understanding directions, instructions or what people are talking about in conversations?

It would be a good idea to get him reassessed. There are work training centers that help a person get in to the ""real"" world. often they find people with autism or a disability a place to work in the community

I would start by finding the work force training center for your area. they would have an idea of a place for a job and would also help him with the things that are deviant(nail biting etc) People need to realize that we are all the same ---people with different needs wether it be help in one realm or another.

I think if you look into a vocational rehabilitation center in your area (sometimes you can find one at the unemployment office) and get him in for an assessment.  They will help him get a job based on his likes/dislikes and abilities.  They may also provide job coaching for him while he adjusts to his new job.  
I work with a girl with Autism and she bites her hand so bad it bleeds sometimes.  It's self stimulation and very normal.

Yes I have had to take him to the doctor for infections in his fingers.  The doctor had to drain them with a needle.  He was surprised at how calm Kyle was while he was doing it.  He kept asking him are you sure this doesn't hurt.  Kyle just grunted at him.  Kyle has very limited facial expressions.  He can lie to you with a very straight face.  Unfortunately I think he is replacing this behaviour with smoking.  With his problems, I think it is going to be very hard to get him to quit.  He has no income so I don't even know where he is getting them from.

You reinforce a behavior that is incompatible with finger biting. That is a behavior  that is the opposite of finger biting. for instance if it is biting fingers we would reinforce clapping hands if they are upset, or perhaps coloring(depending on the age) anything that they can do that they would be unable to bite their fingers while doing. you start slowly. sit down and have a five minute session. if at the end of 5 min. their is no finger biting--give them their favorite treat( a little not a lot--you dont want to satiate their desire for it(basically get tired of it) )----- then set how many sessions you want to do this for before you increase the time--you may want to require 5 sessions of no finger biting before adding another minute. pretty soon you could go all day with out finger biting. You should also record your results so that you can see the progress. basially you can write down the time and give a + for no biting and a - if he bites fingers. if at any time during the session fingers are bitten do not give the reinforcer. Make sure that when you reinforce this you say his name and something like--""good job you didnt bite your fingers at all and kept your hands busy."" or any variation as long as you name what it was that he did that was good
if finger biting occures redirect to whatever it is that you are having the person do and start over. it helps if you have a atimer there so that you can see it--it just helps keep track of the time better.
I finished a course on behavior management just recently and have tried this myself--it really does work. just dont expect immediate results or you will get frustrated--behavior modification takes time.

That is very interesting.  Actually it makes a lot of sense too.  Keep yourself busy, and you won't get into bad habits.  That's my problem with Kyle.  He needs to keep busy.  I have tried putting him in sports, (skating, curling), I tried dance classes, scouts, cadets.  He had a paper route for a few years, but doesn't want to do it now.  We live in a small town, so there are not too many options. We keep trying though.

you could also use differential reinforcement. this is wehre there is more than one behavior present and you ignore one and reinforce the other---the first one that i gave you though would work better because it teaches him something appropriate to replace the innapropriate behaviors with .  Is there something that he really likes to do? if you can find that you will have a good start---just dont push it. If he wants to do it. Ive seen so many things that a guy likes get turned into a program that they have to do that they dont want to do it any more.

You know, the more I read, the more I am convinced that Kyle could have this diagnosis. A lot of these behaviours match his. He was diagnosed with receptive language disorder in 1992. This does not explain his social skills. He is 18 now and can't drive a car. He took driver's ed but he failed. He doesn't want to try again. He can't find a job. He has few friends. When he was first diagnosed, he received extensive therapy (speech, OT, physio). He also has a history of ear infections. He had ear tubes in both ears, twice. There are a lot of little things that I could go on about. My point is how do I go about getting a diagnosis of Aspergers or ruling it out. Our family Dr. has referred us to the psychiatrist. I have also contacted our local coordinator of school services at Kyle's high school. Is there any specific tests or questions I should ask? Is it possible he could have aspergers as well as RLD?

Nathan's Asperger's symptoms are becoming more apparent. At preschool, he  has pulled other kids hair for no reason and  holds his hands over his ears when overstimulated - usually when auditorily overstimulated (if he perceives it as too loud) but it also can be his response if he doesn't get his own way. He is so rigid in his play that no one wants to play with him. It goes on and on....
I took him to school on Monday (MLK holiday) and a few people were there whom I work with. They know about him but have never met him. They asked him how he was and he didn't respond. With one of them, he just started talking about puzzles. He has a lot of difficulty with reciprocal communication. All three people told me later that they feel he is definitely Aspergers. One of them is a special education teacher who has worked in preschool special ed for years. 
Yes, I am a school psych and can see it in other children but when it's your own, it's just different. You can't dx your own child. This hurts. I can't even began to explain what this is like. 
For those that don't know, Nathan was dx with Autism and then undx a few months later by a clinical psychologist. The developmental pediatrician strongly disagreed with the undx, so she still felt he had autism when we left Ohio. 
I am getting him tested by a specialist here in Idaho, so we can have everything in place for kindergarten. Maybe I am completely wrong and he doesn't have Aspergers. Perhaps I am just overanalyzing my own son??? I will find out. I do believe I am correct. I have already filled out a couple of the rating scales that help dx for that with my husband and he came out high (as having Aspergers). 
I know he will struggle. I just know it. He is sensitive in his own way. It's painful to watch. Since he is extremely high functioning, it makes it that much more difficult. He has a high IQ and as he gets older, he will know how different he is and it is up to us to make sure that he has a good self esteem. 
I am struggling emotionally so much this week. My son's behavior in preschool seems to be just a sample of what it will most likely be like during his school years. I work with these kids and see how they struggle (but also see some major successes as well). I am struggling with the loss of a ""normal"" child, especially how I see that Brian is just so ""into me."" He laughs with me, smiles, and has been engaging in this reciprocal nonverbal communication that Nathan never did. When other people mention to me or confirm with me that they agree he is Aspergers, it's good to have that confirmation, but each time the loss is that much more powerful. I have to say, nathan is one funny kid. The other day he took some Rolos (candies) and said, ""Is it Thursday?"" I said, ""No it's Monday."" He said, ""It's Monday and we can only eat these Rolos on Mondays, so we need to eat them today and we need to eat them before daddy gets home because on Mondays daddys can't eat Rolos."" I started cracking up. He really didn't seem to think he was funny. He doesn't realize that he says the funniest things. I love him. 
My husband  most likely on the spectrum, too. Life is extremely lonely sometimes. I PRAY that Brian can remain the way he is. It's nice to get noticed.

When I started to read the first part of your post, it made me think of my niece.  She has been having a hard time in her Kindergarden class.  Her teacher has suggested that she get tested and assessed for ADD.  She has had a problem listening and following directions in class and has hit other students.  She also covers her ears when there is a loud noise...like a toilet flushing, a coffee grinder grinding, on our boat when the motor starts.  I didn't think it was anything, but now you have me wondering.  Its a shame, because my brother ans sil don't think there is anything wrong with her and are not going to get her tested as of now.

In Cub Scouts, I have several special needs kids. Most of them are ADHD. Both of my boys have special needs (different types--one's emotional; one's developmental). Anyway, there's also a kid with Asperger's and a kid with Autism, so I have the unique perspective of seeing them side by side--plus, they're the same age. However, there are two things that make this difficult. Number one, the autistic child is very high functioning and the Asperger's child is a severe case. The second thing is that, even though you are a psychologist, you really are too close to the situation to properly diagnose (possibly). My sister-in-law is a child psychologist. She said she couldn't properly diagnose my son because she was too bias. It turns out that her analysis was pretty-much correct, but some things were skewed by the fact that she's the aunt.
My analysis, with what I've experienced and seen, is that your son's case does sound more like autism--with the very high IQ, but such problems with social interaction and communication. The Asperger child that I know so well also has ADHD, so that throws my analysis off a bit, too. My parent's have an ""adopted"" (kinda) granddaughter that has Asperger's. She is just really quiet, can't hold a conversation, and carries little stuffed animals with her everywhere (although she's in her late teens). She asked my parents if they would be her adopted grandparents (really sweet gesture). They are more like Godparents to her, though. She has some emotional difficulties and has always been seen as ""weird"" to her classmates. Her case seems very different from your son, but there is so much of an age gap, too.
My initial observation and opinion is that it looks like autism. That's probably not what you wanted to hear. Not sure... But, honestly, our autistic kid in Scouts is much less of a problem than the other.
Hope this helps; or at least gives you another point of view.
Take care.

Just let us know how the diagnosis process is going. I'm interested to see what they say. 
With our son, his first diagnosis was incorrect, so don't hesitate to get a 2nd (or 3rd opinion) if you feel you need to for your son. I think with our case, my motherly instincts just kicked in and told me something wasn't right about the first psychologist's assessment. Too bad--she was extremely expensive; even though insurance covered some of the cost. We're now with a new psychologist and a specialist (childhood psychiatrist) at the best children's hospital in our state. Even though it's an hour and a half drive about once a month, it's worth it for proper care and appropriate medication. We are very fortunate that the teachers and administrators at his school are so supportive and understanding, too. 
Good luck and I will pray for wisdom for you and your son's doctor(s).

Thanks!! We need the prayers. I am praying, too. We may have to pay for this out of our pocket (Yikes, the expense) but hopefully it will be worth it. I am going to  ""the specialists"" here in Boise.
I really need prayer in patience for him. I hate to say this, but he is driving me completely nuts. The continuous counting at times, his extremely loud voice (he practically yells although his hearing is normal), his need for order. A few days ago he freaked out because someone messed up his organization of the nutrigrain bars. He ordered them by color and they were ordered in two separate containers. I didn't take the right color and I took one from the bottom instead of the top. He just flipped out and tried to tell me but I couldn't understand what he was trying to say. After I let him calm down he told me, ""Someone took the wrong one,; they were supposed to take one from the top and take green."" He was so upset at this. His anxiety levels are through the roof from his need to order things and his difficulty expressing himself...although his vocabulary is through the roof he doesn't always really know what he is saying. I was not blessed with patience, which is probably why I never became a teacher. Teachers are amazing people! I am a horrible mother for my son right now. I feel just awful that I don't have more patience. Even playing a game with him is so frustrating because his need for control is so high. It far surpasses that of other preschoolers. I seriously need a support group.
If he is actually dx., I will probably set up a support group where I live. It's not in the same school district and I can be a mom and not a psych. I know there are plenty of people who would join.

You could possibly ask the person that prescribed it wether you can start at a lower dosage.  I think they would understand your fear and will help you to get over it/start more progressively.  
Anti-depressants act very differently from one person to the next and therefor it is very difficult to tell someone else what it is like.  I can tell you from my own experiences that :
1.  It takes a while to adjust to the medication 
2.  The first dosage will invariably be changed by the person prescribing it, a couple of times before it works the ""right way"".
3.  The person that prescribed it would no doubt have told you that you should feel comfortable to contact them any time of the day/night if you feel adverse effects from the medication.
4.  The medication takes a while to kick in and it is therefor very important not to miss a dosage or just ""take them when you feel bad"".  In fact, once you start, you should not stop without consulting the person that prescribed it.
5.  Return for a re-evaluation often so the dosage can be adjusted if needs be.
I'm on chronic medication for depression and am forced to be re-evaluated every time the prescription gets re-filled.  I must admit that at the beginning you might feel strange and not truely your self, but that is more than likely because of the fact that you are not used to feeling ""normal"" if that makes sense.
I hope this helps and I wish you all of the best.  The medication does help...not necissarily 100% @ 100% of the time but it definately softens the blow when you need it the most.
I wish you all of the best with the treatment!

I can understand your fear.
Most Anti-Depressants, as any other medication has light, mild and severe side-effects as well as an addictive quality.  The severe side affects only occur in very rare ""special"" cases or in cases of abuse.  Given the right dosage and proper monitoring, a professional will more than likely catch any signs of problems before they become a problem.  Where things turn ugly, is when people don't go back for periodic re-evaluation and or not taking the dosage as prescribed.  Anti-depressants don't do well at all in a scenario of on/off.
If the medication were to be prescribed chronically, I wouldn't worry too much about the addiction side of it, as a chronic prescription's usually means that it is more of a physiological (i.e. brain-chemical) rather than a situational occurance which would require life long medication.  
However, if it was only a situational/environmental occurance, I wouldn't want to take such a drug my self either.
If you don't mind me asking, what led you to seek help with your anxiety?  Were you given a choice in taking the medication, i.e. ""If you really feel like you need something I can prescribe..."" or was it a case of ""I really think you would benifit from medication so I'm going to subscribe...""

Not at all...you weren't rambling 
Very sorry to hear about your daughter.  I hope all is well with her.
Not to second guess a doctor, but it does seem like a bit of an overkill.  Maybe because the Fluoxetine didn't work for the anxiety, he wants to try something stronger.  I would aks about alternatives...
I would rather go with trying to deal with the physical rather than the mental.  At least that way you don't have to worry about any mental side affects or addictions.  But I can understand why the doc wants to try and sedate the anxiety as high bp is quite bad. 
I did at one stage take meds for anxiety and didn't like it one bit.

yeah i though it was overkill like cracking a nut with a sledge hammer! i guess im going to go back and see if i can try some thing else! i would try antidepresants but this particular one has had some serious bad press in america and here in england people are committing  suicide and having serious trouble getting off the thing to the point were they have to come off it by chipping a tiny bit off the tablet each month over a period of up to a year and most get bad anxiety and depression and have to go back on it. really sounds bad ive looked into most other tabs and they have there problems but not this bad it tops the list of drugs that are the hardest to wthdraw from with 3x as many complaints as the number 2 drug im just not that bad to risk my health on this! its probably great for some people and saved many lives! but if your really bad you would easy consider it to help you but for me its to much of a risk i am going to feel stupid telling the doctor all this and he will probs say its my anxiety making me look into all the negative things of the drug but i know im not stupid i have looked at similar drugs in its class and nothing comes close to the down sides of this  paroxetine also known as paxil in america. jesus i love a rant today sorry i just type as my 100mph mind thinks.

That is really well done. 
There are not enough trained professionals out there to conduct the intensive behavior therapy that is extremely needed for individuals with Autism. Some cities, however, do offer special schools/centers for children dx before the age of three. My son got into one immediately after dx but I had to work full time and couldn't stomach him getting on an actual school bus everyday from daycare and going to the place. We tried it a few times. I was right there to see him get off the bus at the school and I have never seen a child so lost in my life. It was such a horrible feeling. He was on the bus for one hour going to the school and one hour going back to daycare. That is for  2 1/2 hours of therapy. It still wasn't the one on one IBI (intensive Behavior Intervention) that is needed for most of these youngsters, but better than nothing. 
There are options out there but some places have more options than others. I lived in Columbus Oh at the time. That placement was state run(very well run apart from the whole bus situation) and anyone could go there, regardless of income. My son was considered more severe at the time so he got in. My little baby has come such a long way! 
If you are dx after 3 years old, then you can get preschool services (1/2 day) at the local school districts - if you qualify. Some preschool teachers are more trained than others. It still isn't as good as the intensive behavior support where those individuals are trained specifically to work with kids with Autism. In Idaho, some kids with Autism can get the one on one IBI in the classroom. I just got a child IBI and the worker will be starting in a few days! Very excited! Students get it for free as the school district is paying the organization. Idaho is WONDERFUL when it comes to getting kids what they need in the school setting regardless of how much money it will cost them! My job is so much easier here:)
I didn't mention that my insurance wouldn't pay for IBI services either.They paid for speech therapy BUT we just received a bill from Columbus Childrens Hospital requesting some of that $$ back. Two years later, the insurance co (UHC) took back the $ from the hospital.  Don't ask. I am ready to find a lawyer.

So, as some of you know, Jordan has developmental delays. He had a follow-up appt.(which was way over due) with the pediatrician at the Children's centre, and they want him to be re-assessed for autism. He was first assessed back 2- 2 1/2 years ago... he was very young, and sometimes is harder to conclude at that age.

Hi Dana;
I know of many individuals who noticed behavior changes in their children after the GF diet was introduced.  The president of our local support group chapter noticed a tremendous change in her daughters right away, and she only had them tested because she, herself was positive.  they did not have any big outward symptoms.  Another lady I know has her autistic son on the GF diet., and he gets out of control when he has gluten.  I know there is a strong body of research that suggests GF diets for ADD and Autism/Aspergers sufferers.

Hi... thanks for checking on our results.  The biopsy didn't confirm celiac.  There was no villi damage noted.  It did note inflammation, erosion, and ulceration.

Not all children with Autism like music. It could be with how the music is presented. I work with a few kids who really do not like music at all due to auditory hypersensitivity. The greatest difficulty is music class and they seem to have sensory overload; some of the reason may be due to auditory hypersenstivity. Two children in particular are unable to attend music at all, and we have had to develop other options for them during music time. 
 On a personal level, my son is on the spectrum and couldn't even listen to music (with words) in preschool, on the radio with me and hated when someone would sing him a song. He is better now. He did, however, seem not not mind classical music. 
A structured, well studied music therapy program does seem like it would be good. All of my experiences have to do with more unstructured or semi structured situations (pertaining to music). 
I would look up ""Electronic auditory stimulation."" I don't know a lot about it but it's something I do want to learn more about.
 If you do hear any additional information about the music therapy please let me know. This is quite interesting.  I will ask my colleagues at work tomorrow for additional information and get back to you. Too bad there isn't more empirical research data.

I am not autistic, but I do have celiac desease and live on the gluten free diet, I also worked in the multiple handicap unit while in high school.  From what I have learned, with children who have autism, the gluten free diet some what serves a similar purpase as retilin, or caffene does for a child with ADHD.  It calms their brain more, usually making it easier for them to communicate with others and comprehend information better. Its a suttle change, and works more for some people than others, but its worth a try.  I also noticed with one fourteen year old child in particular, that he proformed better in school and had fewer outbursts in anger on days when he ate foods lower in sugar, but of corse that describes most kids.

It is not uncommon for a child with autism to have ADHD. attention span is an issue with autism. I know several children with autism that have a very short attention span. for instance one child i know cant sit still at anything for more than a minute. You may have to slowly introduce the hearing aides. just have him wear them for short periods of time--start with 5 min and slowly work your way up to all day and then all the time. it helps if you have a timer that beeps.( this proceedure is called shaping)
It is possible that your 5 year old is ""copying"" children learn by immitation. It may be just what he is doing.

Let's consider the multitude of school vaccinations, alone, containing highly toxic mercury as a preservative and goes right for the brain. Dental amalgams lose 50% of their mercury content throughout one's life as a gas and goes from lungs directly to the brain. And this is just one element.

There is another child that works with him and he may have language goals in addition to speech (articulation) goals. They were working on prepositions (i.e., up, under, over...). Nathan knows those as indicated by several tests. The other kid did not - he is younger. She misunderstood what Nate said and quickly answered him. Another time he was correct. She then put the game away and told the other parent that the exercise was too advanced for ""them"" and went on to the most basic of sorting, which Nate was able to do two years ago. When she said it was too advanced, I stated that Nathan does know his prepositions. I have worked with him on those since he was 18 months old. I am a school psychologist for goodness sakes...I am hyperanal about that stuff.   I have a degree in speech and hearing sciences (speech pathology and audiology) as well. So, when she looked at me and shook her head as if I didn't know what I was talking about I basically almost flipped. It was everything I could do to just stay quite.. I am not one to say my kid knows stuff that he doesn't. I am little more analytical then that. I really tried to let it go. I don't think this woman likes me. She really seems nice and I really just let her go about her job and usually sit there quietly although I don't agree with how she conducts her speech therapy.
Preschool is another issue. The stuff they do in there is a repetition of what he has been doing for at least a year. He knows his shapes, colors, alphabet, sounds, and can almost count to a hundred. His difficulty is social norms (autistic spectrum). So, here I am. He will be going into kindergarten next year as one of the youngest kids and he is not ready socially. Holding him back may not make a difference for him because it's more of a ""disability"" problem and not necessarily maturity. If I hold him back, he will be that much more ahead. He is starting to read a little. 
I found out today, I have some pride issues with my sons intellectual level and if anyone insinuates that my son doesn't know what I feel is a basic concept (that is average or above average for his age level), then I just start steaming. I honestly never knew I was this bad until today.  
I fear I am going to be every teachers worst nightmare. If I find out they are working on letters of the alphabet or alphabet sounds, I will not be happy. I just need to let it go knowing that it is just part of the kindergarten curriculum and Nathan may be more advanced in academics then the average child. He is just so weak in the social norms and attention. He is on the lower end of the Autism Spectrum - most likely Aspergers but it remains to be seen. 
So...how do I let it go?? How do I just deal with the fact that school may be working on concepts that are just too easy for him and let it be? I am not a gifted person so I don't understand.  I just feel so bad for the future teacher unless I can ""get a grip and chill!""

In kindergarten we work on letter naming and initial sound fluency.  We breifly go over shapes and colors for about a week.  After the first 2-3 weeks we're going into measurement, tally marks, number lines, counting by 5s, etc.  We read small books divided by reading level.  We work on handwriting, writing sentences, sounding out words, ending sounds, etc.  I have a few parents that thought their children would be bored.  There's no doubt that they're smart, but there are a lot of things we're learning that they have trouble with or don't catch onto right away.  Holding him back won't do anything for him.  If she's a good teacher, she'll challenge him more than the other kids.  Teachers have to teach the curriculum, but it's up to the teacher if she'll accomodate for individual difference.  There's a lot of kids in my class that range from very low to very bright and you just do what you have to do to reach all kids.
Holding him back would do nothing for him.  His high academic level will be an asset to the class.  RELAX!!!

Thank Goodness! You have helped me tremendously. I love forums. I wouldn't talk about this stuff to any of the people I work with for fear they would think of me as a freak or something - boundaries. 
Nate does know his letters and some initial sound fluency but from the sounds of it, there will be a lot he will learn as well. He may be right where the other kids are at in their knowledge base. He definitely is ""splintered"" in his skills. Give him any spatial reasoning task such as puzzles and he will blow people away. Give him a classroom activity that involves following simple directions, he will have some difficulty. I just need to stop analyzing him and let him be. How in the heck do I do that? I really need to learn to relax. 
I just needed someone to tell me to relax, especially a kindergarten teacher (thanks!!). I am just freaking out about so many things. Luckily I have yet to meet a horrible kindergarten teacher:)

Well, I have been much less than satisfied with geneva's Kindergarten experience thus far.  She brings homework home every week, and here we are just after Thanksgiving and her homwork consistyed of ""Color the circles red, the trinlges orange etc etc.  Seriously!  She has been able to do these things since she was three.  I almost told her to just forget about it-it was past her bedtime and she needed to get it finished for today and it was JUST COLORING!  Her school has a very diversified popuation and demographic of students, many of whom cannot speak english and several of whom are from the homeless shelter, so I understand that not all of the kids are on the same level-I realy do get that. I have been even less impressed with the socialization that I see occurring at her school.  If i had a child with mild Aspergers, I would not send them to the school that Geneva attends.  There is absolutely no time for individualized attention there, and I see her losing her interest in learning every day.  It's very frustrating because I have spent thousands of dollars sending her to a very good preschool tht I really believed in and they did an excellent job with her there.  I fear she is losing her enthusiasm for learning for the sake of learning and is starting to do the bare minimum just to get by.  I guess in short she is not being challenged.  Unfortunately, her report card seemed to state the opposite.  I was dismayed at the grades she received, although I don't believe that grades are by any means a very good reflection of a student's aptitude.  She received no ""Excellent"" marks, and again although grades aren't everything, I find it very difficult to believ ethat my child excells at nothing.  It broke my heart.  Furthermore, under the category ""Recognizes first and last name"" she received a ""Improving"" score.  Hello???  She has been WRITING her first and last name since she was three and a half.  How could she not recognize it.  I don't mean to bash any teachers on these boards.  I really want to believe that her experience is not indicative of every chjild's experience in public school, but I am so disappointed, I could almost cry.  When you ask how to keep your cool and let go of these things, I am sorry to say that i am in your same boat and I don't know how to.  I don't even think I want to.  I want to ensure that she has a proper education and the gift of learning enthusiasm stays with her her whole life.  I don't see it happening right now.

This is going to sound so horrible. I feel more connected to my lil' one than I did with Nathan at this age. Nathan really didn't make a lot of eye contact with me. He really didn't seem to care who was holding him. He was interested in the world around him more than people. He was dx with Autism at age two by three different professionals. He even had symptoms at age 3 months due to the lack of eye contact. He really didn't want anything to do with people until he was around three. He has since been undx because all of his symptoms miraculously went away. He is very social now. 
Brian makes so much eye contact it's so precious (and completely normal). I see what I didn't have with Nathan and feel guilty that I feel more connected with Brian. It is very hard for me to be away from Brian when I am at work for just two days a week. With Nathan, I didn't really have that hard of time. I just can't explain it. It must be the eye contact. Brian smiles at me a lot and coos at me. Nathan never did. He rarely babbled when he got older. 
So, that's that. I feel like such a bad mommy for feeling this way.

I felt completely differently with Geneva as an infant than I did with hannah.  I was kind of indifferent with Hannah because she, too did not want to be close and held all the time, and when she did, we didn;t have those long ""love ins"" that Geneva and I had when she was an infant.  Now, Hannah has worked her way into my heart and I do feel much more ""bonded"" to her than I did at first.  She's almost 16 months old and I am just now starting to feel toward her what i tyhink I should have felt when she was a newborn.  Each child is different, I guess.  You know that you love Nathan as much as you love Brian, and you know deep in your heart that you are a great mom.

It's harder with my daughter to get a hug, but sometimes it just comes out of the blue. It's an effort and it's worth it.

I am having problems with my 10 year old. She gets very upset if you get on to her. If you ask her why she has done something she breaks into tears apologizing. She doesn't however give explanations. The next time she says because she wants or doesn't want to. She will then cop with ""I hate it here!"" She has many other strange behaviors such as constantly organizing different types of playing cards. This goes on all day long. She flat refuses to do any type of physical activity. She will sit and stare at you for long periods of time bulging her eyes or just squinting and blinking them over and over and over again. She has speech problems. The speech teacher says she is about to test out of speech because she does great in class but the second she leaves she starts all over again with poor speech. She refuses to do homework. She simply writes down answers unless you go through each problem individually with her. Instead of reading books she ""reads"" the pictures. I am just at such a loss. No matter what you ask of her she flat refuses. She only plays with younger kids for the most part (4 and 5 year olds) and bullies all that she plays with. She only likes playing games such as house, or school, or even cops but only if she is in charge. I am at such a loss. She has been in group counseling for almost 4 months and nothing is changing. If anything else it is getting worse. She is getting worse by the day. We are getting back results from a psychological assessment on Thursday but I am not sure it is all behavioral.

They want to switch him to Trileptal from Dilantin?  Overall, I would say to do your research and if you don't see any big issues, to give it a try. 
Trileptal is a newer med with fewer side-effects, althogh it can make you very very tired. It can also help with moodiness, which can effect a lot of Auties (I have an Autie son).
I have been on both medications. I had to come off of both. I would have stayed on Trileptal, but I got the very rare blood sodium problem.
Dilantin however, gave me joint pain and liver damage.  It is a very old med and can have some pretty horrible side effects.
They may have himon both for awhile while they titrate one up and he other one down (neither med shoudl be started or stopped abruptly). This is nomal. Just keep a close eye on your son during the transition and if he is verbal, tell him to let you know if he feels pain, sick or faint. 
I hope this helps and good luck.

Have you asked your doctor to do any genetics testing? There is a specific type of autism that is related to tubular sclerosis. These genetic tests can tell if this is the type your child has.  If it is then the autism is caused by benign tumors in the brain and it requires an entire different type of treatment.  If I were you I would look up autism.org websites and read about the symptoms and tell your doctor about any family that may have had these symptoms.  Its important to find out what is causing the problem so it is dealt with correctly.

Yes. Almost all vaccinations cause more GOOD than harm. We have erradicated Polio in America, and nearly driven out Measles, Mumps, and Rubella. The HPV vaccine promises to help prevent cervical cancer in sexually active women. Many child-hood fatalities are prevented with vaccines. Meningococcal disease (Menegitis) is also preventable with a vaccine; and it is heavily deadly without it. I'm thoroully happy to have a poke in my arm every 10 years to prevent Tetanus. 
The only vaccine I remember there being ""controversy"" over was the Anthrax vaccine. It had some nasty side effects, and it was all because of post 9/11 fears.

In March 2003, 4-month-old Devin was given a Diphtheria tetanus acellular pertussis vaccination. Hours later, his mother, Melinda Simon, said he suffered seizures.
Those seizures continued over the next year and a half and led to financial devastation, 10TV News reported.
""One shot that my son would get in order to stop a seizure is $264 a dose, that's just one dose,"" Simon said. ""We can use three in one day.""
Devin died on New Year's Eve 2004. Simon said she then had to prove that the vaccine led to her son's death.

Of course, when Junior smacks the cat in the head and Mommy laughs about it because she doesn't want to damage his self-esteem by punishing him, the kid will think it's okay to hurt others and will move on to hurting humans. I agree that kids can be taught not to hit - kids will all, at some point, pick up hitting. It's just up to the parents to get off their duffs and make the kid understand that what they're doing is wrong.
How would I handle an aggressive kid? Easy - introduce the back of my hand to his face. He wants to hit, he's gonna see how crappy it feels to be on the receiving end.

so there is no such thing as psychological problems?    
autism, add, adhd are all made up things?   
i actually agree with you that children now a days do not have enough discipline but to say these other problems do not exist is irresponsible  and untrue.

Both my parents didn't have a clue what it was like to raise children.
Both of them were workaholics. but...
One was an alcoholic and one was totally self centered and all about themself.
I am very thankful that I ended up as stable as I am today!  I could have had many troubles by my 17th year!
We all try to do better than our parents.  Yes, probably too, we are all a product of our environment.

I agree that there are kids out there that 'supposedely' have adhd, that some discipline would cure amazingly enough.  Kids need to learn that hitting the cat or throwing rocks at the dog next door is not ok behavior.  Imo, children that abuse animals are vicitms of abuse themselves in one form or another.   
 
As for the kids with autism, aspergers, or other illnesses, there is no faking that.  There is no amount of time outs that is going to make autism or it's symptoms go away.  A lot of those kids are non verbal and probably have a host of other issues that will come out later.  Hitting is a way that they express themselves.  Sure they can be taught more appropriate ways of dealing, but it takes time and patience.

I used to think children who were ill-behaved were caused directly by poor parenting.  Now I believe it's about 50% nature and 50% nurture.  I think children are born with their own personalities and mennerisms.  We, as parents can try to ameliorate some of the negative aspects of our children's personalities.  My oldest daughter, the ""daisy picker"" is very pokey.  She is also very messy.  So we try to help her overcome some of these things.  My younger child is ver short-tempered (even as a 1 year old) and moody, so we are trying to help her learn to use words or signs to indicate her needs and are trying to help her understand how to express herself.  One thing that I will not tolerate from my children is aggression.  If they act in this way, they are removed from the situation until they can calm themselves.

I have a friend who has genuine add as well, and believe me, he is a very different person off ritalin. He can focus and do school work on ritalin, he' an honors student with all a's in college.
When he was a little kid, he literally could not sit still. He didn't even have a seat at his desk because he could not stay down. His teachers thought he was mentally disabled because they couldn't get him to retain anything. Well, an iq test finally ruled out that, as he was actually incredibly intelligent. He got put on ritalin, and has been a model student ever since.
I've seen the change in his attention span myself. He can be quite annoying off his meds because you'll tell him to stop doing something annoying, like tapping on the table, and he'll go ""okay!"" and two minutes later he's doing it again. he's not a bad dude, he just needs ritalin to help his brain work right.

Although I would admit that perhaps autism and add/adhd are over-diagnosed, they are very real problems.  Autism is indeed on the rise in our country, and they are having a hard time figuring out exactly why.  It was an interesting finding several years ago that cases of autism were highest in silicon valley, although, medical personnel are still not sure why.  there is no medication for autism, unless it is combined with a certain degree of psychotic illness as well. So whether all children diagnosed with autism are truly autistic is up for debate, but the fact that the incidence is rising is a fact.  Maybe we are better at diagnosing the problem.  
Parents who have their children tested for autism are not necessarily lazy parents.  In fact, parents have usually tried everything they can think of to help their child before getting them tested, as no parent really wants that as a diagnosis for their child.  
I think that a lot of times rambunctious children with behavior issues are, indeed diagnosed with add/adhd when, in fact, the problem lies in parenting, behavior issues, and a myriad of other problems.  I do not, however believe that all kids (or adults) diagnosed with add.adhd need to be medicated if they can be taught how to self-regulate.  My dh has adhd, and he was on meds as a kid but they made him freak out like that clock in Alice In Wonderland at the mad tea party or something.  He does not take anything, and he does fine.  He does do the incessant tapping sometimes, and is distracted by things, but I would rather have himlike this than freaked out or doped up.  
anyway that's my 2 cents worth

I said it's a requirement for health.  It is terrible to see them in pain and cry because of a needle, but .I would rather have them be in pain for a minute than be close to death or sick for months/years from an illness .I could prevent.  I do think it should be a personal choice and nobody should be shunned for choosing to not immunize their children.

Sometimes it's for religious reasons, sometimes the family are vegans and they want no animal products in their kids, some are worried about the mmr and the link to autism (if there really is one) and some don't want to cause of bad reactions on family members. 
I got Trey all his vaccines including the chicken pox and flu, because of his asthma I need to be vigilant about him getting sick.  I never had problems with any of the vaccines and there's nothing in my religion against shots, so trey has them all and my future child(ren??) will get them too

Hello, all.  My son is 7 and has a mild form of autism.  We have been to hell and back (pardon my language!) with ent issues, which seems to be common among autistics.  I say ""back,"" because we now rely mostly on homeopathy and our health is worlds better than it was when we used to rely on conventional medicine.
He has just been through a period with lots of yellow/green nasal discharge (now cleared) and a high fever (about 38.5 c for several days; now normal to low grade).  During all this he's had transient ear pain, and this morning an ent doc said his ear canals are red, but his eardrums are perfectly normal.  (two days ago a pediatrician said his ear canals were so red and swollen that she couldn't even see his eardrums.) so far, he has not had any visible discharge from either ear.
Question: why would a head cold cause an *outer* ear infection?  This has happened before, and the ent doc can't seem to explain it, nor does he seem curious.  (we need a new doc, I know, but in the meantime  .  .  .) could this be caused by something simple like scratching the ear with a dirty finger (he actually doesn't do this much), or even resting on a pillow where a dirty tissue had been placed?  Or could we be looking at some sort of atypical immune response (also common among autistics)?

Firstly, i'm sorry to hear of you, your family's and your son's plight in this matter.
Secondly, I am not a medical expert, by any means, but I have an interest in many sciences, etc., including biology and related fields
in most cases I would tend to think that contact with most 'household' sources of bacteria (including things like dirty tissues) would not lead to infections of this nature, much less using a pillow that has come into contact with such, unless the source was particularly virile.   I.E.  The difference between a normal dirty tissue and a dirty tissue that was used by, say, a contagious flu sufferer.
From what you described, I personally do not think this sounds like an outer ear infection, strictly speaking.   I would be more inclined to think it was a middle ear infection that may have penetrated further than the ear drum, how or where into I could not say.   I'm not sure as to how a middle ear infection would be able to cause the ear canal to swell like you have described, however, I would propose that what has occurred is that an outer ear infection has possibly arisen from a nasal infection that has spread into the outer ear via the middle ear.
Your description of a yellow/green nasal discharge and fever would seem to indicate a nasal or middle ear infection and this would be my suspicion in locating a source of infection.
If the problem persists, my advice would be to push the point with the your family doctor and/or ent doctor.   I'm in australia, so I can only speak from a relatively small realm of experience, however I would advocate finding a doctor that is willing to take more of an interest in this: a doctor that cannot explain a condition and then is not curious about it's occurrence does not sound like a doctor that is taking you seriously.
I also find that a number of doctors I have been to seem to think that if they cannot see anything wrong, then there is nothing wrong (and therefore the it's in the patient's head).
Regardless of whether you stay with your current doctors or find better ones, be sure to labour the point and push to get what you want.   Do not stop until you are satisfied that nothing more can be done.   Of course expense will be a factor, and here again I sympathise if this is not a meetable requirement, as I am currently a poor man myself undergoing expensive and continual ent consultation as well as university study.

Thanks for your reply.  It turned out that, just as you say, he does have a double middle ear infection that spread to the ear canals.  Again just as you say, the first doctor was not taking us seriously and was giving us the bum's rush.  (i guess the chronic, regular patients are just more lucrative and worth more of his time.  So much for professionalism.) fortunately, friends on my neighborhood mom's grapevine *do* take me seriously and helped me locate a better doctor.  
And i'm pleased to report that we have not had to give him antibiotics.  We gave the new doctor's information to our homeopath, she had another think, and her new remedy suggestion hit the mark.  My son is now clearly on the mend.  The new ent doc was very understanding about our wish to avoid medication and is perfectly willing to give us follow-up checks until his eardrums are completely back to normal.  
Fwiw, this doctor's opinion is that, theoretically, a child with a headcold could definitely give himself or herself an outer ear infection by sticking a finger partway into the canal to scratch.

Yes, I did miss the obvious  :wink: ...  I forgot cross-contamination from site-to-site, this is completely understandable considering many nasal and middle/outer ear infections are similar, and the locations are so closely associated and located.
Your resolution makes me more seriously consider an alternative therapeutic approach for my own ent problems, something i've been considering for a while but haven't actually looked into.
