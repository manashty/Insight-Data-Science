1,Sulfur and sulfates question.,I have been subbing in a special education classroom for the last week and today a child with autism had a severe behavior outburst. Afterward the school systems autism specialist came and met with the teachers present and he told me that people with autism do not have sulfates in their body and this is believed to related to behavioral issues. I thought this was interesting but didn't want to use up the specialist's time with my curiosity. I was hoping someone on this subreddit could explain this further or refer me to a good article on the subject. ,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1xuenq/sulfur_and_sulfates_question/,0

4,Siblings of adults with ASD,"Hello!

My name is Laura Nordone, and I am a graduate student at the Smith College School for Social Work. I am writing to ask for your help in completing my Master's thesis by promoting my brief (10 minute) anonymous electronic survey on growing up with a sibling with an Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis, and how this may impact perception on family cohesion and current life satisfaction. By promoting this research to siblings of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, you are helping to determine what the impact of growing up with a sibling with ASD can have on the rest of the family. Their responses could give insight as to how professionals and agencies like you can effectively support and empower families when there is a sibling with an ASD diagnosis in the family.

Siblings are eligible to participate in my study if they are over 18 years of age, and have a sibling that is diagnosed with ASD, whether that be Autism Disorder, Asperger’s Disorder, or PDD—NOS. Participation is anonymous, so I will have no way of knowing who participated. Please share this survey link with your clients by posting the link where siblings can easily see the link, share the link with other siblings, and/ or allow siblings access to computers to take this short survey.

Below is a link to the website containing my thesis questionnaire.

https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/F2BP3RH

If you have any questions about my research or the nature of participation, please feel free to reply to this email (lnordone@smith.edu).

Thank you for your time and interest in sibling interactions and family cohesion when there is a sibling with ASD in the family!

5,Affordable Care Act and Autism,"Today my company informed me that we are switching insurance to some very small network I have never heard of in a self insured program.

No problem there, but I am worried about my sons autism coverage.

I am in Illinois, so my small group coverage had a $36,000 annual autism benefit. I never understood however, what that meant.

I am trying to figure out now if I would be better of going to the health exchange to get coverage for my son under Obamacare. Does anyone know that, if any, impact the ACA had on autism benefits on health insurance in the state of Illinois?

I wrote an article discussing how the practice has a disparate impact on certain groups, and, thus, probably runs afoul of the law. I want to do follow ups focusing on how different groups are protected from this kind of discrimination.  Obviously, some are more protected than others.


Have any of you felt that you lost out on a position because you couldn't ""connect"" with the people at the interview stage, despite the fact that you were clearly qualified for the job?  I'd like to hear some stories from the Autistic community to get a sense of how large a problem this is.

15,What is the opposite of Autism?,"I was discussing this with a friend and we were searching for an answer. We felt that someone could be exhibiting reactions that are the same as autistic people would react, but for the opposite reasons. For example, an autistic person may choose to be alone rather than to socialize, because they have trouble connecting with others and would prefer to be alone. But what about someone who chooses to be alone because they are OVERLY affected by their interactions with others? They are hyper-aware of the emotions and feelings of others and it's too much for them, so they'd prefer to be alone. Overly emotional, empathetic, etc.


I've been googling for answers and came across someone's random theory on this (http://muneraven.livejournal.com/143228.html), basically saying that whatever condition is the opposite of autism, it would look almost exactly like autism to everyone else:


&gt;For example let's take that first behavior: an autistic child may not make eye contact because they don't get a sense of positive human connection through eye contact like most people do.  But if your experience was in fact the opposite of that, if the sense of connection you got through eye contact was very intense?  You might well avoid protracted eye contact just like an autistic child.   Different reason, same behavior. 

Also this:

&gt;An autistic person may miss social cues like tone of voice or facial expression and therefore struggle socially with her peers.  An anti-autistic person, however, might struggle with her peers for an entirely different reason:  She is TOO aware of unspoken social cues.  Human beings often behave as if they want one thing, say they want another thing, and actually, inside, want something else entirely.  What if anti-autistic people can read much of this all at once?  How confusing is that?   Such sensitivity might well make for social awkwardness.

Just wondering what r/autism's take on this would be.

17,Dealing with family members/ loved ones with autism,"Greetings everyone on reddit! I hope you are all doing well. It’s me scmc698. Im not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this. If it is not mods let me know and please tell me where to re post this.  Just a little back story, I am the youngest (22 years of age) of three boys. My older brother (the middle 24 years old) is suffering from autism. It was really hard on my parents, especially when we were young, because as I am sure you all know, there was not much available information about autism 20+ years ago.  I don’t think people even knew what that was back then. I was a young child so I did not understand the severity of the situation but I was able to pick up that my brother was not “normal,” but loved him nonetheless.  I remember my mother crying and always being worried because no Doctor from tons of countries could tell us what was wrong with my brother. My parents did their best to raise him, teach him, and provide special education. Even with my brothers disability he was and is my best friend. Although the youngest, I had to step up to the plate and help raise him, teaching him about life, and getting him out of trouble, etc. When I turned 18 I left for college and I think these years did a number on my brother. He is a lot more introvert and overall socially awkward. I recently moved back home because I am in a nursing school near my home and it is expensive. It has been tough re-interacting with my brother. Especially when we are in public.  He OFTEN says or  does things that comes across as rude/offensive even if he meant no harm. And people are cruel , heartless and don’t understand. No matter how much I talk or yell or scream to him he just doesn’t seem to listen or apply what I tell him too and it is really burning me out. It’s gotten so bad that I don’t look forward going out into public with him. But I love him. I am posting this because recently there was an incident at a store. My brother said something to customer at an ice-cream shop we were at and it turned into a bit of scene. It seems like things of this sort always happen. At the very least once per week.  You would think that after 22 years of dealing with someone with autism I would be more of an expert but im not. Please guys I need help. I a 22 year old man am literally in tears right now. It’s so hard dealing with an autistic person let alone your older brother. Any helpful tips, resources or any inspirational stories.


**tl;dr me being away at college has changed both me (22/m) and my older brother with autism (24/m) He is alot harder to deal with. I love him so much but i am at my limit.

24,"As an adult sibling of Autistic brother, how do I start preparing for the future?","
A bit of background:

	* I'm 30, and my brother is 26. He is low functioning, and has the mind of a 4yr old child. My parents have shouldered the responsibility of caring for him, and I haven't been too involved yet. Sometimes I wonder if I'm an Aspie, but probably not...
	* We came from a poor immigrant family, and while I've been lucky enough to have accomplished a lot (got a BS and MS in engineering), the thought of my potential future responsibilities is overwhelming. My parents don't have much money, engineers don't make alot of money, and I won't have the finances to be able to support everyone.
	* He's on the medicaid/medicare/SSA disability program, I'm not sure which one (all?) or how that works exactly, but who knows what will happen when laws change. The aid the government provides now doesn't seem like it covers much in terms of living or care costs.
	* I have depression issues, and can barely take care of myself now, let alone entertain the thought of having a family or children of my own, in addition to taking care of him. I am also very short tempered and don't like who I become when I'm around my brother too long - so it would be best if he didn't live with me.
	* Ideally, I don't plan on living in the US when I get old, at least for most of the year. My retirement plan is to leave the country and live somewhere remote and cheap. Maybe it's not realistic, but are there any ways for him to get a good living environment where he is taken care of without bankrupting me?

Questions:

	* Is there a book or roadmap of what programs and things I can do to plan for his future?
	* What if he somehow ends up having kids? I can't take care of them.
	* Are there programs out there to provide care for him when my parents can't care for him?



	* From all of the above, I sound like an asshole, and even I think I'm an asshole. But the reality is that with my personality, I can't handle taking care of him personally and I can't afford to pay for his care, but I do want him to be able to live decently and not be hurt or abused or end up on the street. I don't know what to do. Please, if you guys have advice or resources, let me know where to start.

The following questions pertain to children with autism and their transitions into a school environment, and your experiences with the process. Feel free to leave questions blank, and to ask for clarification about any specific questions. No confidential information pertaining to students is needed for this interview. 

1. What is your position in the school system? (EA, principal, teacher, etc)

2. Think about children who may be at risk and children who have had successful transitions into school. When this transition goes smoothly, what factors are in place to make the process go well?
	• What characteristics of the child and family help the process go well?
	• What characteristics of the child’s previous program/environment help foster the transition into school?
	• What characteristics of the school help the process?
	• Are there other contributing factors?

3. Are children’s transitions into school a problem at your school? If so, in what ways?

4. What are the challenges in helping children make the transition in your school? Are there any particular barriers?

5. Are there other things that schools could do to help children become familiar with their new environment?

6. Now I’d like to ask about your impressions of the transition process and your experiences. In what aspects of the process did you participate? For example, did you participate in transition activities for preschoolers entering kindergarten or other activities to enhance relationships for children and families as they entered kindergarten?
	• What went well?
	• What changes might you make?

7. Is there anything more you wish to share about children’s transitions into school?

What hormones directly associate with the development of the corpus callosum and can in utero infection, most notably Toxoplasma gondii, (which I know attacks neurons and axion) inhibit the growth of the corpus callosum. Toxoplasma gondii infects the brain, but what correlation does it have with in utero brain development? Does a child who gets the infection from the mother have difficulties with corpus collosum development. Kind of like while the brain is trying to fight off the infection it inhibits or retards the development of other brain structures which could cause autism in an otherwise healthy fetus. If I’ve read correctly children with ASD also have underdeveloped Corpus Callosum. I know correlation does not equal causation, but what is the data telling us?? Hey research doctors!!!

36,Autism Films - The Black Balloon,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Balloon_(film)

Has anyone seen this? Set in 1970's Australia, it's about a teenage boy and his family living with his autistic brother, Charlie.





Having seen a few films about autism, this is the one I felt captured the condition best - at least in terms of what I've experienced with my younger brother (non-verbal, PDD). All the scenes were so relatable to me - the funny times, the loving and the stressful.

I think something that's often overlooked with autistic people (esp. children), is the effect on parents and siblings, and their struggles of coping with daily life living with an autistic person.

Anyway, this film really spoke to me. In terms of the autistic character Charlie, his role has been captured to an absolute tee. As difficult as certain times may be with an autistic child or sibling, sometimes it helps a little to watch or listen to people going through similar things - the good and the bad.

 Definitely recommend to all :) give it a watch if you haven't yet!",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1wvb6d/autism_films_the_black_balloon/,33

I've been with a guy with autism for 5 months, I'm his first serious girlfriend. Now I thought everything was going really well, but last week he left me because he can't handle being in a relationship. He still likes me, and we're still ""seeing each other"" but he doesn't deal with the label of a relationship very well. I don't fully understand, because nothing has changed since we split up, we've both agreed we won't be intermate with other people etc and to me this feels like a relationship but without the label. 

I'm fine with this for now, I've told him at some point I do want to be his official girlfriend again though but I don't want to rush him. All my friends however are trying to convince me he's just using me for physical things. I really don't think he is, he isn't like that at all but they are putting doubt in my head.

Ahem, where was I...

Well... Do you?!

For a lot of parents and caregivers, the topic of where to begin in exercise and fitness can be a difficult to figure out. This can often be the case because there is so much going on in the life of a parent/caregiver that it is hard to understand how exercise can benefit the individual and what the expectation from exercise can be.
I posit this to you, fellow redditors: Exercise increases overall physiological, neurological, and psychological well being.
If one were to look at exercise in the way an occupational therapist looks at a patient, the expectation would be that specific training can increase the ability for a few specific behaviors, habits, movements, etc.

BUT, since exercise offers so many systemic benefits to an individual, exercise has the potential to not only increase specific performance in a given ability, it also has the potential to increase overall baseline functioning of an individual.

So on top of everything a parent/caregiver is already doing (which I know is A LOT), exercise has the potential to make EVERYTHING better (better sleep, mood, cognitive performance, sensory perception, balance, etc.).
So don't look at exercise as a secondary or tertiary task that is ""just a good thing to do""; understand it has the capacity to make EVERY LEVEL OF FUNCTIONING BETTER.

Don't agree? COME AT ME! I love supporting my claims!

49,Best way to broach the subject with my parents?,"TL;DR: I think I might be autistic. Wondering how to ask my parents to take me to a doctor so I can be sure (or if this is even needed)
-----------------------------
Here's the deal. For a long time, I have though I had OCD. I've been to several doctors and have been able to repress the compulsions, but never remove them. This is because all the therapy that exists for OCD is based on removing the obsessions (and rightly so). Unfortunately when my obsessions are removed/lessened by therapy, my compulsions (hair-winding,walking a certain way,and other things) do not.

I was discussing some mutual interests with an friend of mine who is high-functioning Asperger's. We are both very into computers, and I was joking about how I almost always have either a humanHardDrive tutorial or DefCon talk playing while I'm working, even if I'm working on English or whatever or even playing video games! She said,""Oh wow,I do that too... but my doctor says it's an aspie thing.""
We went on tho compare notes,so to speak, and we came up with a big list of Aspergers-like things I did. I've added more after looking at various websites too:know the word and have a clear idea of what i want to say

*Hair-winding/touching

*""Infoglutton"" tendancies (needing to always be recieving information even if I'mnot really processing it, about my specific interests)

*Being often unable to articulate a word even when I know the word and have a clear idea of what i want to say

*Shaking/waving my hands when unable to think of a word or phrase

*Constantly talking about my ideas to others,and going off on huge tangents that spawn other tangents, etc

*Extreme aversion to social interaction because I have a tendancy to fuck it up

So, if you're willing,could you help me out,/r/autism? Basically I'm wondering four things (if any one is false the following are invalid anyway):

1) Do you think I'm autistic?
2) Do you think I should ask a doctor?

56,Trying to settle the dispute of Autism being caused by vaccines with my parents?,"Hi, my brother is diagnosed with Autism, and all these years my parents believe the cause of it was because of the vaccines he has had as a baby. They explained that when he got his vaccines, he broke out into a rash, and was rushed to the hospital, and before then he was communicating easily and normally with the family, but after this trip to the hospital he shut down. Now I understand why this would make them undoubtedly believe that the vaccines were the cause, but it is my understanding that this theory was disproven years ago. I have read A LOT on it, the studies, the articles, etc etc. over the years, while they are still quoting the episode of Oprah that came some time ago. My dad is usually the one to NEVER admit when he's wrong and ALWAYS argues the opposing side even if he's wrong (we just got into a disscussion right before this one about how Medicinal Marijuana, unlike recreational, is ""boiled with water and then drunk,"" or ""snorted like cocaine,"" in which he swears up and down this is true but even as I showed him articles about pre-rolled joints at a medicinal dispensary he refuses to admit being wrong). They are constantly quoting Autism Speaks, which as I understand is generally looked down upon by the Autistic community.

I am currently in the process of being diagnosed with ASD.

My parents always knew something was different about me since I was a small child, the classic symptoms of Autism have always been there. After struggling for years with school and teachers which have often dismissed me or when I was younger suspended me from school for things which I didn't know were wrong, it is nice to finally have closure.

One example of an event which led to me being suspended was when we were having our photographs taken. The flash on the camera used to overstimulate me and cause me to have a meltdown. All the kids would laugh at me. One day I asked the teacher if I could have my photograph taken outdoors to avoid the flash and I was shouted at and suspended and lost my breaktimes for a week. I still had to have the photograph taken with the flash, which, of course, caused me to meltdown. I was about 10 years old. The same teacher was fired for slapping me around the face a few weeks later.

It is nice to know that my behaviour wasn't just me being difficult or unsociable but the consequence of uncommon neural mapping. I wish the teachers and dinner ladies and bullies would know what they put me through and how they ruined my life for 4+ years and delayed my education enormously.

67,My Senior Seminar paper is on under/misdiagnosis of females on spectrum. Please share your story with me!,"Ladies, I am looking for testimonials about under/misdiagnosis of your ASD. You don't have to have an official diagnosis to help me with this. What I want are stories of your symptoms being overlooked, being given incorrect diagnoses (often conduct disorder, ADHD, personality disorders, even schizophrenia), or otherwise living without knowing what was ""wrong"" with you. There's a lot of evidence that females are pressured socially to perform in different ways, and these expectations or our interests lead to different coping mechanisms. I go into the gender/historical issues in my paper as well. I could info-dump on this all day. :)

You should pick a pseudonym or I will--your username will look funny in my paper! Feel free to PM me about it. 

A little background about my paper for those interested:

I focus on Simon Baron-Cohen's ""Extreme Male Brain"" (EMB) theory of autism, which makes several claims: that the male brain is better at systemizing, the female brain is better at empathizing, and that autism involves hyper-systemizing. However, given the serious differences in the rate of diagnosis for males versus females on the spectrum, there are a lot of problems with this theory and assumptions that go along with it. Hans Asperger noted the preponderance of males in the 1940's, and the diagnostic criteria are still tailored to the presentation of symptoms more common in males. EMB theory and the prejudice of medical professionals therefore perpetuate this problem: since females don't fit the criteria in the same way, we continue to slip through without the proper diagnosis, and the male bias continues.

Additionally, the correlation between gender dysphoria and ASD should be caution enough against terms like EMB. Divisive terminology for gender serves to perpetuate the discomfort of people who have difficulty with the male/female dichotomy. 

I will be graduating with English writing/Neuroscience majors and a gender studies minor. I've been working on this for several months now, and read hundreds of pages of research. I would like to bolster it with personal stories, because this happens to real people. If you are interested you can see what I have so far, but I don't want teh Interwebs to have it.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1vydxb/my_senior_seminar_paper_is_on_undermisdiagnosis/,63

Recent research has revealed many adverse effects caused by maternal autoantibodies on the developing fetal brain. I hope to elucidate this connection by surveying mothers who have children on the spectrum. My research is very non-invasive, it involves a series of questions in a survey format. If interested in participating, please click on, or copy paste the survey link below in your browser.

69,SNEAK PEEK at the Stages Language Builder app!,"http://www.languagebuilderapp.com/

Stages Learning Materials is soon to release the Language Builder app for iPad. The app uses 500+ photographic images to teach 6 different activities, which are common foundational exercises utilized in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy with young children with autism. 

The educational needs of children with Autism are diverse and often very specific to each individual child. Therapists, educators, and parents need to be able to customize and control the activities, and often make adjustments on the fly. Designing for this type of flexibility, the app gives the educator control over a variety of settings ranging from choosing types of prompts and feedback to choosing specific words to individualize instruction for each child.

70,Does anyone find as they get older some traits go away and others spring up?,"Greetings all, new to this sub, just found it.

Bit of backstory:

I was diagnosed around 7 years old which has helped me a lot as I've come to understand myself growing up, I had a reason why I was how I was and I could read up about it.

At 24 years of age I've found that, as I've grown up, some traits have gone away and others have appeared which weren't there before.

I've gotten a lot better at socialising and understanding certain things, my girlfriend of the last 3 years has helped a lot with that (I love her very dearly for it though, sadly, I'm terrible at showing it as I'm not very good at relationships, as I've learnt from this one) and as I've gotten older some of the traits have gone away, perhaps because I learned better how to deal with them but I've also found that lately I struggle in crowds, I absolutely hate going out in public because crowded areas are just..........scary.

I've always felt that way about parties too, I hate being at a party where I hardly know anyone as it's very scary, I don't know what to say to introduce myself, I worry I might upset someone etc.

I've never struggled in public places before until now, it's odd and annoys me as it makes me feel rather childlike.

That's.....about it I think.

Nice to meet you all!

73,"Question on reading, recognizing sight words, et. al.","Hiya folks.  

I ask questions from time to time, my son is 2.5 and has autism.  

Like many on the spectrum, he's had a long standing fascination with letters and numbers.  Has always loved movie credits.  We watch everything with closed captioning on.  Loves license plates, magnetic letters and numbers.  He can identify upper and lowercase letters and can make the appropriate letter sounds.

He's really verbal now, which we're stoked about.  Lots of functional words, both manding for things and observational stuff too, which is cool.  

I have noticed on a few separate occasions now that he appears to be reading, or at least recognizing words that he knows and repeating them verbally.  When he spoke in pure jargon, he would ""read"" his books quite frequently as well.  

I'm hoping to get some insights from some other parents or educators on what we can do to point him in the right direction with reading.  Seems like he's doing well himself, but I'm always looking for another good idea from someone who has been there, done that.

I have laminated some simple sentences into flash cards and we work on pointing a word to identify it and then repeating it.  That's going okay so far.

Thanks so much, you guys are the best.

75,need help!,Hi my girlfriend has autism/Aspergers and she is really struggling to cope with it. She has had no help in the past and struggles to accept help because of this. I need a way of being able to calm her down when she gets upset as to be honest I am struggling to cope when she blows up. She need a coping mechanism of some sort a way of distracting herself when she gets really upset. I've tired giving her the ones I know of like listening to music playing video games etc but she won't do them. She gets very emotional and just starts screaming and punching and sometimes trying to hurt herself. She is going to see someone soon but we are waiting on a referral which could take up to 8 weeks. So do you guys have any advice on how she could cope in the mean time to control her emotions. We had an argument tonight because we had to take a rat back as she couldn't cope with it looking the same as one if our others and she is really upset by it. I am too and the whole situation has made her a lot worse as she is struggling with accepting it.

While she still gets therapy at school, they gave her a 'break' from regular therapy with OT/PT/Speech. She was completely unwilling to do anything for them. While she can say alot more, her social and life skills are suffering. I hope to get some answers today. Maybe so medicine that can keep her calm and focused. Her OCD is way out of hand. EVERYTHING is turning into an argument or a battle. Such as she just woke up, came to find me, and since I made the mistake of telling her 'good morning' first, and.....she explodes.

78,Curious as to whether my 2 year old son has the beginning signs of autism,"My son is 2 years and 4 months old and I'm starting to suspect he has autism. He isn't saying any words at all, he said 'hiya' for about 2 weeks and then just stopped saying it. He now gets frustrated if I try and get him to say it again, along with any other words I try to get him to say. He doesn't point at things, he still puts objects in his mouth as opposed to playing with them properly (for example a jigsaw puzzle, he'd just put the pieces in his mouth instead of trying to fit them into place). He runs on his tiptoes when he's 'excited' and flaps his arms about. He makes shapes with his hand infront of his eyes sometimes and he doesn't eat finger foods or feed himself from a bowl, I still have to spoon-feed him. He is sometimes unresponsive when we talk to him, however he's nowhere  near as ignorant as he used to be, he at least responds to his name now whereas a good 6 months ago if there was something else occupying him he wouldn't even look at you if you yelled his name. He gets agitated and frustrated if his daily routine is changed in any way, for example I took him to his first mother &amp; baby group today and he started playing up about half an hour before the session was due to end, I'm guessing he doesn't like overly crowded places much.
Despite all this though, he still loves cuddles and gives me eye contact all the time. He's really affectionate and sociable, he just won't talk and is behind on his fine motor skills.
The health visitor came to do his 2 year checkup the other day and she was concerned about his speech too, so she said she would refer him to a speech therapist and look into getting him assessed for autism for me. She's coming back in 2 weeks to let me know what's going on and to take things further if necessary. I guess I've always known he was a bit different...he had a traumatic birth; his heartbeat kept dipping on the monitor when I was in labour and they took the monitor off for a while so I could bounce on the exercise ball for a bit and walk around, but when they put it back on they'd lost him completely and I had to be rushed in for an emergency c-section and got put to sleep for the process. There's no history of mental...illness? What would you call it? I'm not sure what autism is classed as...but yeah, there's no history of it in my family and I'm pretty sure there's none of it in his father's family, so I don't know where it could've come from. Can these things just occur randomly and not be hereditary? I dunno. All I know is I love him to bits and it doesn't change anything really. I'm hoping he's gonna be one of those super smart autistic kids who gets a super awesome job and buys me a mansion somewhere ;) (jokes)

79,"Can anyone send me in the right direction to find someone who or an agency which; understands and can teach us, skills for including someone with autism in our group?","We are a small progressive church which tries to practice the radical welcoming taught by Jesus. He ate and otherwise hung out with marginalized people of all sorts, including Samaritans if you can believe that! (joke, but in those days Samaritans were looked down upon. It gives deeper meaning to the story of ""The Good Samaritan"") Anyway, we have had a young man (25yoa) for over a year now, who is a high functioning autistic, who has aged out of the system of support he grew up within. He does not exhibit what one might assume is a common characteristic of autistics, not  tolerating much social stimulation. We are struggling with ways to help him interact with congregants in a way that respects everyones boundaries and limits.
He has a natural interest in young women but his approaches are off-putting and can be ""scary"". He wants to hug, touch hair, face and untie shoes (?) He is quite strong and can be overwhelming for some. His hand shakes and hugs can be painful and he needs constant reminders to ""be gentle"". He is quite adept at texting and can be demanding of time and attention if he gets your phone number. Also, out in the city if he sees someone he knows, he will really push the limits to the point of almost stalking, wanting to go to lunch or dinner, ""why not?"", not taking no for an answer, etc. 
We have a volunteer group of ""shepherds"" who accompany him through the service and then ""coffee hour"" afterwards, intervening when necessary but mostly reminding him of the rules and helping congregants set their own boundaries. 

Recently we had a bit of a blow up (shouting, swearing, name calling) and we asked him to leave and wait an extra week before he came back. The group of shepherds is currently assessing the situation. Are we capable of meeting his needs and the needs of others in the community. There is a full spectrum of feelings from ""no, he is too disruptive"" to ""he is a blessing and an inspiration."" Some are just burned out, not seeing any progress or knowing whether there can even be any expectation of ""progress"". Also, some of us have the feeling that he comes primarily, even solely, because of the young women and does not experience or value the ""spiritual"" aspects of our assembly. 

One idea fielded is ""can we engage someone to help us shepherd him while teaching us skills to carry on after their engagement?"" Some of us are feeling that we are at some kind of limit, wether it is a skill limit, a patience limit, a grace limit ... 

Does anyone know of a resource in the Philadelphia PA region that would be in a position to assist or train us? 

Thanks, and sorry for the long read.

84,Proud of my school,"I work as a special education teacher's aide in a state school. One of the students I work with one-on-one for about half the school day is autistic (and far enough along on the spectrum that she needs one-on-one support at all times during the school day).

In a lot of schools I've worked at or seen, students like this are mostly ignored by the rest of the student body as outcasts or ""weird,"" but I've been really excited to find that this isn't the case here, either with the students or the faculty.

The faculty are all aware that she's got different needs, and every day, I see them making an effort to include her in the same activities with the rest of the students, in a way that challenges her but also allows her a good opportunity to succeed. They don't react to her in frustration or try to get rid of her, and this behaviour rubs off on the other students as well. 

She has easily half a dozen good friends - many of whom are gen ed students and not other special ed students, and nearly every student in the whole school interacts with her in a way that allows her to feel included but not overwhelmed. They are aware of the extent to which she is different than them, and they take that into consideration in order to help her fit in. When she does get upset and react in ways that are far different from how her peers would react, they don't look at her differently. They reach out and try to learn what's wrong and to comfort and reassure her, even when she, in her frustration, lashes out at them.

I've been involved with special education for most of my life, and I've rarely, if ever, seen a school which so universally works to respect and include all of its students and show them that they're loved in a way that they can understand.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1vgnot/proud_of_my_school/,77
85,Questions from a child care provider of an autistic girl,"This is my first time in this subreddit so I hope this is ok to post here. I am a stay at home dad with two girls and I also watch the daughter of a friend of ours who will be 3 in a couple of months. I have been watching their daughter for 2 years now and she has always seemed to be somewhat delayed in her development but I just chalked it up to kids developing at different rates. The last few months, however, I have really noticed how far behind she is compared to other kids her age. I often have them playing together with other kids their ages and it is very apparent that she is not at the same level as kids even younger than she is. Her parents are usually very open about talking about her (both good and bad) but have never brought up anything about her development.

She can speak but rarely puts a whole sentence together. If she does it's something very simple. Most of the time she talks to herself and repeats things often. For example, if she's looking out the car window, she'll say things like ""Tree! Yeah tree, good job"" and give herself a ""five"". She does this all day with lots of different objects. She has also never told me she was hungry, wanted a drink, etc. She rarely shows any range of emotion. She'll cry every once in a while but it's rare. Most of the time she is just stone-faced with the occasional smile. She never reacts to getting hurt, like if she falls while running at the zoo, she'll just get up and keep going even if she cut her knee or hands.

We are trying to work on potting training at the moment and she has no reaction to it at all. Even if she goes while sitting on the potty, she doesn't recognize it or say anything. Physically she seems to be ok except lacks some coordination. She gets frustrated playing with my almost 4 year old daughter and doesn't really understand how to play pretend (kitchen, babies, etc).

These are just some of the issues I have noticed and while trying to do some searching into what I can do to help her along, I came across numerous autism sites. I've taken many of their quizzes and every one came back that she is high risk for autism. I know little to nothing about this subject so I'm hoping you all can help. 

My main struggle right now is if/how I should bring it up with her parents. I will only be watching her for a few more months and then we will be moving. I don't want to cause any issues with our friends or offend them by bringing it up but I really just want to see her get whatever help she needs. I have casually brought up different issues or delays I've noticed but they have always just agreed and then not mentioned it again. I don't for a second think they are unfit as parents, they are fantastic with her. I'm just not sure if they don't see any issues or are just not willing to acknowledge it.

86,Missing a connection with my older PDDNOS brother,"Hey r/autism --


I'm reaching out to other siblings here. I'm 22 (female) and my brother is 24. Growing up with him was difficult, but very special -- he was extremely fixated on me, which for many years was really hard to deal with (constant attention from someone who doesn't ""get"" socializing can be trying, to say the least). That said, we were also close in our own way, and I was both fiercely protective of him and always proud. I still can't stop kvelling about him; he is like no one I've ever met and is simply a beautiful soul. 


Like I said, my brother used to pick on me as his main form of interaction. Now, however, he's matured a great deal and he understands that picking on me is inappropriate -- but hasn't replaced it with a different form of interaction, because while he knows how to converse, he seems to find it very taxing. He likes to make jokes and he LOVES when our dad starts to tease him, but he really likes these particular inside jokes he has with my parents, and I'm not in on them, since I live a few states away now. I do come home with some frequency, and I know he looks forwards to my visits -- but I feel like we barely interact anymore. He gets uncomfortable if I ask him too many questions and basically just wants to talk about our dog, which I'm not always in the mood to entertain, and it still gives me no window into how he's feeling. I feel guilty about not always being up for the few topics he is comfortable with and want to interact more with him -- he's my only sibling and I'm so close with my parents; it feels wrong to not have him have a strong presence in my life.


I'm wondering if this is a common feeling for other siblings and if you have any recommendations. When I ask him how school is, he'll say ""it's good, now be quiet"" or maybe answer a few questions before he'll say ""ok, that's enough."" He really likes to play games from our childhood, like bothering our parents in the car or getting into poking wars, but it's hard for me to sustain interest in that long-term. 


tl;dr: Looking for advice on how to interact with PDDNOS brother, hopefully in a way that doesn't revert to childhood behaviors or nonsense conversations.

88,New 'Autism Alert Card' for those on the spectrum.,"Hey everyone :)

(Sorry if I should have asked the mods first before posting a link. I read the things on the right hand side and couldn't see anything about it - I have also posted this on the Aspergers subreddit, but I thought it would be useful here too!)

I've just put up a pre-order for a new 'Autism Alert Card' that I designed and I wanted to share it with you. I'd been planning to do this project at the start of this year, for some time, but my idea was reinforced when someone posted about it on my forum, asking if anyone knew where they could get a hard wearing/weather proof one, as opposed to their card or laminated ones.

So, after much messing around contacting various companies who specialize in printing credit card quality plastic cards, I have ordered some, and have put the pre-order up on my site as it seemed to be something a lot of people wanted. I wanted the design to be bright and colourful and written a bit differently to how they normally are - and as I know all too well what it's like to panic whilst out in public, I thought I could do it justice.

The idea is that you can carry it with you easily in your purse or wallet, or in a lanyard card holder, and you will be able to use it in public if you are struggling to articulate something and need help etc, and it would be useful in airports, train stations or if you need to speak to the police or other officials etc. Just something which goes some way to explaining why you are panicking or not speaking etc, and gives the person a bit of info on how to handle it and stuffs.

So here it is: http://www.willowhope.com/collections/resources/products/autistic-spectrum-alert-card-pre-order

I hope you guys like it!

I'm contacting local police departments about it as well, and my most local department got back to me (the Equality and Diversity Officer) and would like to meet with me to find out more about the work I do to raise awareness and to look at the card. 

Just to point out, I had to order these in bulk as you can't order small quantities, so that cost me quite a lot of money to do, and the price has to reflect that, but whenever it starts been profit, the money will go back into my other projects which are all aimed at helping people on the spectrum and raising awareness (I write books, run a forum, run a website, write a blog and make videos, amongst other little random things - which mostly, tend to cost money to maintain).

96,Controlling Stims As An Adult,"I am 29, PDDNOS and I experience both ""hidden"" and more obvious stimming. My ""hidden"" stims are things like picking at my lips in a very specific pattern or tugging on my earlobes. My more stereotypical stims include jumping, swinging my arms around by twisting my torso (this feels more relaxing than anything in the world!), and mildly flapping my hands while counting to the number 73 in my head. I also move my feet around almost constantly and love to stomp, dance, tap, crunch snow (the best!) etc. Thankfully I'm lucky enough to be surround by friends who accept me the way I am, so if I feel the need to ""act goofy"", as people say (haha), people don't really mind. However on a day to day basis I still have to control these urges to jump around and count on my hands. Even though my partner accepts me the way I am, I don't feel comfortable jumping around them! (They are NT.) Tonight I'm thinking about it and I almost feel surprised at how good I've become at waiting for ""appropriate times"" to ""let it all hang out."" I really wish that it wasn't considered weird to do things like jump or swing you're arms often. I'm curious how other adults in the spectrum relate to this.

97,Question for parents of children under 5,"My 4-year old son has just been accepted into a preschool for children with disabilities (PPCD) due to the following: communication, social, cognitive (problem solving and play skills), sensori-motor, speech, and self-help.

We've been going crazy trying to get *any* professional to explain exactly what condition our son has other than a generic ""autism spectrum"".  We've been to neuro-psychologists, geneticists, pediatricians.

He was born with torticollis (tighter neck muscle on one side), and low muscle tone.  He started walking around 18 months, but didn't run until 2.5, and even now at 4 he has a goofy skippy-type run that doesn't engage the quads.  He does a fair bit of stimming (*jumping up and down, hand flapping, constantly licking lips, picking at fingernails until they split*).  Rocks back and forth when observing something.  Moves very awkwardly and hesitantly.  Quads very poorly developed regardless of exercises and physical therapy -- going down the stairs, squatting is an issue.  Although lanky, very strong upper body -- can do several pull-ups with minimal to moderate help.  Fully potty trained except an night.

Electronics and falling/rolling objects excite him beyond anything -- falling marbles, balls down the stairs, cars coming out of tunnels, etc.  We severely limit all electronic use, but he is a wizard with smartphones and tablets, it's uncanny.  Loves repetitive play with favorite toys, but does get bored and comes asks for something else to do.  Lots of echolalia (""Mama always comes back"", ""good job, good job"").  Has to be prompted many times to answer questions, and when answering, he says something completely random, e.g. *parent: what's your favorite food?  Child: he likes to play with Thomas!*  

Good memory -- can recite entire book passages, but speech is a baby-like mimic as if he doesn't understand the meaning of most words.  Knew the entire map of Europe at age 2 and could point out countries by their outlines on flash cards.  Knows the alphabet and can count to 100, but can't grasp the concept of putting letters or numbers together.  We've tried everything -- can't get him to understand that ""M"" and ""A"" makes ""MAH"".  Very distractable and needs constant prompting.  Doesn't seem to employ any kind of strategy or planning during chores and play, doesn't get concepts of ""biggest"", ""smallest"", and the like.  Can't copy simple shapes.  Doesn't get puzzles, no matter how simple.  Does seems to understand shapes and spacial orientation -- great with matching more complex objects with their respective holes/openings in the toy.

Very affectionate, enjoys cuddling and building forts together.  Eye contact is fleeting.  Very nervous around other children and will run away when approached.  Clings to parents in all unfamiliar social settings.  Doesn't share or respond to peers.  Very sensitive to our facial expressions and will cry easily at ""*papa is upset because you tore up your fingernails again*"" face, but will rebound immediately when ""*papa is happy*"".

My wife is constantly in the state of turmoil because her son has to go to the school for disabled kids, yet he's a beautiful blond angel boy, and so far behind other kids.  Other kids his age are asking about where kitties go when they die and whether Thomas the Train is for babies, and our son doesn't understand the concepts of ""I"" and ""You"".  And worse of all, we can't get a definitive answer out of anyone ...

98,What has or would have helped you?,"My niece is autistic. My brother and his fiancee found out a year and half ago. I just found out a few months ago when we went for a trip to my hometown. I asked him one day when we were having lunch. She seemed to have similarities to my husband's cousin who is autistic. 

I don't feel hurt that he didn't tell me. I just wish I had known we so could help him in some way. It's been emotional from what it seems like. This is his first child. I have two children and one on the way. We both lost our mother at a young age. 

I didn't realize how much emotionally it was effecting him until we got in a little argument over the phone. I was trying to make him see the bright side. He was just wanting to vent and I didn't know. He explained it in a way with our mom. Saying when everyone would say it would be ok when it wasn't.  Saying how all he has ever wanted was this little girl in this shitty life we've had and she is broken.

I told him he could vent to me when ever he wanted. We live about two thousand miles away from each other. I love this little girl, I was at her birth and think about her often. 

What can I do? How can I comfort my brother? What has helped you from family members? What do you wish they would have said/done? What do I need to know? 

I didn't treat her any different when I found out. It made sense on some behaviors she has. My children adore her and they get along so well. She will never not have love from us.

100,"22 year old autistic with heightened sensory to sound, UK advice needed.","Hi

I am a 22 year old autistic who has a heightened sensory to sound. Especially specific waves, frequencies, loudness and pitch.

E.g. I can stand in the MIDDLE of a festival full of 50,000 people with my favourite music playing, extremely loud and a lot of stimuli as you can imagine.

But my brother 15m away in his bedroom talking down a microphone on the xbox? Can't handle it, drives me insane. His loudness and pitch are the worst, 11 year old kid yelling down the mic. I'm at the point where i've been prescribed diazepam even though they knew I was already addicted to this drug, along with cannabis and I'm a polydrug user, but only addicted to diazepam and cannabis.

I do drugs to escape, especially my current living environment. I do not condone drug use, even if medical drugs; consult your drs please.

I've been on a housing waiting list for 170days or so now waiting to get my own place in an area where no children or pets are allowed to live there. Still waiting, but I'm at the point where I'm considering suicide for the 3rd time. No one seems to understand my problem, they know I'm autistic but they really don't know how INSANE certain sounds drive me.

Had two bits of bad news today, but I'll soldier on. Any advice about showing people, social housing and the council of my autism, what it entails and how horrific certain sounds are to me?

My mother doesn't know what to do, she got a dog that makes the worst bark pitch/loud ratio possible and now her spoilt kid, my half brother yells down his xbox every night, I just need advice on what to do in the NOW other than ""wait and endure"" until I get my own place.

I'm literally stuck in this place until I get sorted, but honestly? I'm not sure I can handle this noise much longer. So what advice do you have for me, go visit council, as autistic alone, how do I explain this to them without getting upset and them misunderstanding me... just pack a bag and walk with ear isolating headphones, there was always something nice about walking with music on with either cool summer breeze or harsh winter breeze.

As an adult male with autism, I feel I have no future right now. This isn't a suicidal threat post seeking attention, I'm just pointing out that each day the possibility of taking my own life seems more acceptable, but I'm not there yet, I'll endure and suffer further before I give up completely, but please as others with autism, or those that study/know it.

My sister is also affected by depression, anxiety and dyspraxia as well as autism, but I thought this sub would be most relevant.


My sister isn't allowed out on her own anymore because my parents are worried she'll fall over due to the dyspraxia. She can't go to the cinema any more because of her social anxiety. She rarely washes herself, or tidies her room and never helps around the house. She doesn't use a knife and fork or put her shoes on herself, brush her own hair or buy her own clothes.


She used to have a lot more personal responsibility before she was diagnosed eg. She would be allowed to take the bus home by herself.

103,Inappropriate Stimming,"I am the parent of 3 children with ASD.  Life to say the least is challenging!  My middle son is 4 years old and he is who I am most concerned about.  To date, he still has not made any attempt to speak, he whistles, squeals, shreeks and hums.  He does not play with any toys.  His favorite things to do are swing, jump on the trampoline, twirl sticks and other long objects and tear paper.  He is relentless with it.  Tears anything he can to the tiniest pieces possible.  

Lately, he's getting very aggressive with some inappropriate stimming.  He likes to either grab me or his brothers and dig his nails into our arms and shake us, or worse, sit on his brothers and try to choke them with both hands.  I am not sure where he's learning this crazy stuff from, but it is a habit/routine that I am having an extremely difficult time breaking him of.  

I am just not sure what else I can do for him.  I work full-time.  He's in a specific autism centered pre-k and he gets extra therapy. I feel guilty and selfish saying this, but I wonder what else I can do for him?  It's a lot to handle with other kids I have to share my attention with everyone.

Has anyone else got suggestions about correcting inappropriate stimming?  Once I can get a handle on this, there's a million other things he needs help with...but baby steps right?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1uiikz/inappropriate_stimming/,91

It makes me feel terrible and it's hurting my relationship with my dad because I can't help but feel angry at this situation and he is always bringing it up despite telling me that he has plans for after he dies.  It scares me knowing people want to me to take on something that big that I never signed up for, and if I don't, I'll be a pariah.   It makes me want to throw up.   I don't want him to end up in some home either.   

I wish people would take potential godparents, should a situation like this ever occur, into consideration.

105,Apparently a big head could mean Autism,"A preemptive farewell.

Starts in doctor’s office describing the situation, needing to order a CT scan because of head size.  What a goofy thing to worry about, especially after the way the birth had gone down.

Such a precious life.  Worrying about being gone.  Reading up on all the different options.  Projected hypochondria, the pitfalls of online diagnosing and availability of medical information and conflicting information.  Non productive worry.  But need to be fully aware to intervene.  The worst crime would be not doing something if we could have.

I would kill for this being.  I would do anything for this being.  Besides change my daily bad habits. 

Wanting to say goodbye in case he’s gone.  Enjoy every moment.  Not fair.  Breaks my heart to see him laughing, see him so happy, the way he adores his caterpillar toy and learning to walk.  His teeth and they way the look when he laughs with his mouth wide open.  Asking wife if it’s normal to think he’s the cutest child.  Really don’t know how he looks to others, especially with his big head but it really doesn’t matter.  Although I love to hear how cute he is.  

I want to enjoy every moment he looks at me.  Every moment he’s enjoying now, while he has full capacity like every other kid can.  What it means for my life is hard to think about, but mostly it’s about his ability to feel happiness.  Can they still feel happiness in the same way?  What does life feel like to them?

Finding out the CT scan is negative is an enormous relief, but bittersweet in a way knowing what that might mean.  Asking the doctor about autism and he is a little disappointed because I can tell he was excited about this call, but it doesn’t matter what he thinks.  All that matters is if there’s a chance to alter the course, that we act as soon as we can.

I would kill to reverse it.  I would move the earth to reverse it for you.  It’s my crusade, the reason I was born is to battle for your life and your ability to enjoy it.  But maybe it’s fine anyway.  

Balancing work to ensure I have resources to protect you in the way you might need, but also wanting to spend every moment with you before you retreat behind a wall of ice.  Stay with me my son.  Stay with me.  Don’t leave me.  Don’t let go.  

I let my wife know my concerns so she’s aware in case it comes to a point we need to act without hesitation.  But can’t let her know the extent of my worry.  Looking at her so proud of him, everything she does for him to make him complete.  What will this do to her?  What will this do to us?  What will this do to our other kids and our dreams for all of us?

Is there a cure?  Could there be a way to stop it?
Look me in the eye, look at me, don’t ever stop looking at me or seeing me.  I’m here for you. Say my name.  Know me.  Always know me and don’t lose me. 

I have a short time with you before you retreat. God you’re so happy.

123,"Looking for a diagnosis, thinking I might have PDD-NOS... help...","Little story first.

I'm a 21, male with a college degree. Living a relatively normal life, until christmas day. The entirety of my christmas break at home I was having issues with my family, and got to the point I just about walked out. Parents had me sit down and chat about what was going on, next morning my mother mentioned to me that when I was younger they had taken me into a psychologists for developmental concerns, but I didn't show enough signs to confirm Autism. 

After reading about Autism and PDD-NOS more, I'm pretty sure I either have it or something similar, and am looking for a diagnosis, how do I go about finding someone who can diagnosis me? (I live in MN, if that helps at all.)

Thanks, any other thoughts would be nice too!

Also,
Rundown about why I think I have PDD-NOS:

* I'm intellectually gifted, graduated four years of college in two, but struggle in normal classes if I'm not enjoying them.
* I have large problems with social interaction especially small talk, but can talk about myself and specific interests for days, but have horrible name retention
* I used to think I was on the sociopath/narcism spectrum as I tend to not be empathic, rather good at manipulation, can read emotions/faces/etc decently well
* Have very strong cognitive empathy, but almost no emotional empathy
* I took speech development though out elementary school, and till have some problems in the speech department (but nothing that you can really notice in daily communication).
* I have very strong ""orders"" that have to be followed, but I break them every couple months and make new ones (placement of furniture, books, etc.)",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1twdvk/looking_for_a_diagnosis_thinking_i_might_have/,106

127,Advice for a carer,"In posting this I hope, that someone can offer some advice or tips for me to allow my client to safely enjoy his holiday!


I support a tween age boy, he is fairly low on the spectrum and he was introduced to me by his teacher as ""non verbal"" - I later discovered, he is verbal but only uses about 10 different words regularly..  He is very sweet and most of the time I just let him chill and do his own thing as I work with him after hard days at school. Usually I take him to unwind down at the beach, the park or for a bushwalk. I know he has engaged in some serious aggressive and defiant behaviours towards some of his other carers or teachers but he has never had any meltdowns or intentionally lashed out at me. I'm pretty sure he likes me (well I hope he does), as most of the time he will do as he is asked. 

I plan on taking him too a local zoo in the coming week, but I am a little unsure as how to keep him safe when we are wandering around the zoo as I imagine there will be alot of people there.  This will be the first time I am with him in a very busy, possibly overwhelming environment. 

I'm pretty much plan on letting him ""lead the way"", keeping both eyes on him constantly and telling him to stay close to me. 


Does anyone have any other helpful or handy hints for keeping him happy and safe?

131,"UPDATE: ""Mom does horrible things to me in response to my behaviour...""","Thanks for all the responses to my first post. I'm just going to make this new post instead of responding to each individually because I have the same thing to say to everyone.

Many of you were asking how old I am. I just turned 18, and for the most part I'm living in a different city for university. The last time she did any of these things to me was when I visited for Thanksgiving. We had a fight two days ago that was escalating which is why I wrote this; I was kind of sick of it. After reading your responses over the last few days I took a long shower and screamed it all out. It really freaks me out to see you all telling me that this is abuse because I don't see my mom that way; she does her best and is not inherently malicious, and when I think of an abuser I think of someone intentionally preying on somebody who is weaker. She isn't preying on me, she is just trying to help, and if anything I abuse her; she says it all the time. Though of course none of what I've done to her has come from malicious intent. Abuse is a fuzzy line. However, everything she does hurts me tremendously, so I've decided to take your advice and write her a letter but after I go back at the end of the holidays.

Most of you told me to find a way to get out of the situation as well. Although I have moved for the school year, I don't have a job and I'm living entirely on student loans so I had planned to come back home for the summer, which is probably a bad idea. This semester I'm taking four classes instead of five, and even with four classes holding down a job will be incredibly difficult because of many factors. The main factor is that I wasn't diagnosed with ASD until quite recently, so as you can deduce I haven't had much therapy or help at all with my autism-related difficulties. Now that I know, this semester should go by a little bit easier, and hopefully with the lightened class load I can keep a part-time job and maybe continue to live in this city over the summer. That's my plan and I'm going to try pretty hard to make it happen.

I also found many of you suggested she get help, or both of us together in family counseling. A few years ago we did family counseling, but since it was a free service provided by the city it only lasted a few weeks, so any progress we made was lost quickly after it ended. As for individual help for her, she has told me before that I'm the one who needs help the most and that I should focus on my own problems instead of hers. That makes me angry but there isn't anything I can do about it.

So that's all. Thanks again.

135,"My mom does horrible things to me in response to my behavior, but she doesn't know the damage shes doing and I'm not sure how to tell her","When I have a meltdown she usually grabs me and forces me to the ground, then she sits on top of me, pulls my hair and pushes my face into the carpet and screams in my ear to stop. This is the worst pain I have ever experienced, and I'm not exagerating. Sometimes she twists my arm backwards. It is also emotionally painful because I don't like being confined and it terrifies me. When this happens I will just panic more, and scream more and hit her more and usually the police are called and I'm brought to the mental health ward.

I'm terrified of the dark, so I like to keep the lights on in the house. We don't have a lot of money so she is always on my back about turning them off. Sometimes I forget or am too scared to turn them off and so she unscrews all of the light bulbs in the house which exacerbates my fear. This usually sends me into meltdown mode, after which she will take away other privileges and go back on promises she previously made.

She yells a lot too. She says it's just the way she is and also she's hard of hearing, and that's a valid reason but it doesn't help me. I'm super sensitive to sound, so when she starts yelling I will usually plug my ears and curl up on the ground until I don't hear muffled screams. Sometimes I'll rock myself and sing. When I do this she makes fun of me and calls me a baby and tells me to grow up and stop feeling sorry for myself, which really really hurts and usually sends me into meltdown mode again.

She says I freak out whenever I don't get what I want. I try to explain to her that I need certain things, but she thinks I should just control myself or get better coping skills. I don't know how to control myself nor am I able to find better coping skills. When I have gone to the mental health ward they have told me that writing in a journal or going for a walk are good coping skills but these don't help me because I'm in so much distress when I have a meltdown, they aren't enough to release what I'm feeling.

I will admit that my meltdowns make me do some crazy things. I have set fires to cars before to get rid of anxiety and panic. I have hit my mother and broken her things. I've put holes in the walls and I usually scream a lot. I know that she is confused and doesn't know how to handle me, but she won't listen when I tell her she's making it worse. She just tells me that it's my fault and I should treat her better. I treat her pretty bad now because I hate her for all the pain she's caused me, but I don't know how to fix that. I don't trust her or love her or like her but I know she loves me, and she's the only one who would take care of me for a long period of time if anything bad happened. If I could be independent I wouldn't continue to put myself and her in those situations, but I'm a weak person.

138,Need Advice: Untreated adult brother with Nonverbal Learning Disorder (NLD) pulling my family apart.,"I am a person in need of guidance and direction for the sake of my family’s future.  For as long as I can remember, my family has been dealing unsuccessfully with problems my brother has.  It is not that he is unkind, some kind of drug addict or even that he gets into any type of trouble, it that he is living with NLD (Non-verbal learning disorder).  
For those of you that don’t know, NLD is a disorder which affects your social skills quite profoundly.  Only about 40% of face to face communication is verbal, where the other 60% is made up of the mood of the situation, the other person’s feelings, the other persons goals in the conversation… ect.  
Because of this, my brother is unable to successfully deal with social situations.  My parents are his biggest social life and the effect he adversely has a somewhat detrimental effect on their lives.  He has no friends, and next to no job.  He is able to do some work with a business venture he has been involved in for years that pays him nothing where he can only be minorly successful because he is able to talk on the phone for all of it (minimizing the effects of NLD).  He is now in his mid-thirties and digressing a little bit more with each passing day.  My writing may not do it justice but believe me when I say his life is quite empty and overall sad.  What is more, because he doesn’t understand how people are feeling sometimes and I guess how the world works, he has a large sense of entitlement in the house where he lives rent free, eats all the food he wants, does not go to work and does not feel he is wrong in doing so (I think this is due in part to the disorder but also because of the situation it has pushed him into).  
Now the person most affected by this is my brother, but it has had a large effect on the rest of my family. It has caused a lot of frustration between my parents as they are not on the same page of what should be done… and have not been for years.  They both have very different views on what should be done but only my mother tries to do anything about it.  My father is beyond doing anything at this point as he is fed up and tired of trying… it simply seems easier to do nothing.  This has left my mother feeling powerless and tensions between my parents being high (that puts things lightly). 
Now I am only here for some of the year as I go to school in a different place, but every time I come back I only see things getting worse and worse.  There are more parts to this whole story I will not get into but the whole story is long, slightly painful and extensive.  
But the point of writing this was not just to get my story out there, I really need some help and resources to present my family with so we can have some sort of help with dealing with these problems.  We need help creating a plan and changes to help my brother deal with not only his NLD but the life that has resulted from it.     If you have any experience with this or would be willing to give me any type of advice, please comment.  Thank you in advance.  

TLDR: Older brother’s NLD has never been treated properly and his life has degraded completely.  Lots of family stress and problems have been the result. Need advice for professionals or people who have dealt with NLD before.

139,Need advice: Autism and overstimulation during intimacy,"Hi all,

My girlfriend and I (we are both women) have been together for several months now and have begun getting intimate in the last month or two. She has high-functioning autism and I do not. The first time we had sex, everything went smoothly--though I suspect now that she might have been hiding some discomfort.

Since then, though, we've been having a more difficult time. Things go okay for a little while but when she reaches a certain level of arousal, she becomes overstimulated and ""icky,"" she says. (She describes the feeling as bugs crawling under her skin, or her whole body falling asleep the way your hands and feet do.) When that happens, we pull back and cuddle up for a little while, but almost every time, she ends up experiencing a full-on panic attack and is shaken up for hours afterward.

We keep our lines of communication very open during intimacy, and never do it when she's not in the mood (obviously). We've also tried using deep massage and other tougher, heavier stimuli on her body to sort of take the place of the ""icky,"" but it hasn't worked for us.

I'm having a hard time finding resources online on this particular topic, so I'm wondering if anyone here has any advice or links that might help.

142,Autism signs in toddlers?,"I have a 21-month-old daughter who might have autism.

Her dad and I were initially concerned with her language development. We researched autism a little bit shortly and there were some red flags, so we brought it up to her pediatrician at her 18-month well baby checkup. They sent us a packet, we submitted it, and she was evaluated by a state funded center for people with developmental disabilities for about an hour. There were some specific milestones that she had to fulfill, and pointing with her pointer finger is one of them. Suddenly she was in speech therapy and early intervention for her fine motor skills. 

The specialists say that she makes excellent eye contact and they noticed that she tries to engage us in activities. I began to think that she doesn't have autism.

That being said, yesterday we saw a doctor for an intake assessment at the hospital who provides our insurance and medical care. I guess this was part 1 of 2 to officially diagnose her but I'm not sure. The doctor hasn't met my daughter (they needed our undivided attention to answer questions and suggested we leave her with a baby sitter) and there were some red flags that might put her on the spectrum. We were talking about meaningful words and we mentioned that she does things like drop an object, like a paper, then she will say sorry, drop another paper, say sorry. So she says sorry like she knows what it means but it's not that meaningful to her because she would stop if she were truly sorry. Ftr, we stunt give het a hard time. We mostly just laugh and say awww and give her a hug (because it's a big deal that she leaned a new word) and we tell her it's ok.

Anyway, the doctor mentioned something about repetitive behavior and I thought long and hard when we left about what we told her that would suggest that she does things repetitively. The example we provided wad a one-time thing and we only mentioned it because I wasn't sure if we should count sorry as part of her ""meaningful words."" 

TL;DR: Doctor said she's on the spectrum and will be evaluated in a few weeks based on one instance of repetitive behavior, speech delay, and fine motor delay. However she loves to cuddle and it was noted by 2 specialists that she makes excellent eye contact.

Based on your experience as parents/care takers/teachers, do autistic toddlers make eye contact and cuddle?

Now, he's having one with behavior. In school, he breaks loose and runs away from his teachers. He does this at the after school program also. He's strong enough to open the big doors they have and they are concerned for his safety.

the past 3 nights my son (2.5) has been waking up crying loudly in the wee hours around 2-3 AM.  When my husband goes in the room, my son is shaking and really needy for a parent and won't go back to sleep.  

He sleeps in a pitch black room, and we realized he left his buzz lightyear toy in there, which glows in the dark.  This coincided with the nightmares starting, so we removed it.  So I think we've got a handle on what caused the problem, we just don't know how to help him get over being scared.

If you look at the glowing on Buzz, it's not even apparent that it was Buzz Lightyear, it's just sort of a source of light.  So showing my son that Buzz is not in the room wouldn't really help.  Honestly, I'd be freaked out too if my room was always totally dark and suddenly there was this light glowing there.

My husband comforted him on the couch for an hour and a half this past evening and then took my son back in his bedroom, but as soon as they got in there he started screaming and shaking.

We're at a loss as what the best way to handle this is.  Any advice appreciated!

148,"My autism, patterns and self-analyzation.","Hi, I'm desau.

I have autism and you might recognize me from my previous post. 
I recently decided to share what I ""discovered"" about my autism, patterns and self-analyzing.
As you might know from my previous post I have the talent of programming because of my autism.
A big part of programming is patterns. Information that look scrambled but has a sense of order behind it; patterns. As a young kid I got into programming and patterns. Recently I programmed an encrypter and decrypter with an encryption based on one that I as a young child could solve without the need of the decrypter or the encryption key because it contained a pattern. 
Then there are regular expressions in programming and as a kid they fascinated me, they also consist out of a bunch of characters which at first look like just a mess of characters but to me they made sense.
Here is an example of a regular expression:

/.+\@.+..+$/

another one:

/(?=..{6,})(?=.[A-Z])(?=.*\d)/

I was able as a kid to figure the patterns out that existed in these strings of ""data"" the start and end with the forwards slashes, the continues use of certain symbols used after or before certain symbols These are just tiny regular expressions but I've worked with expressions that were a lot longer that I wouldn't get lost in easily.
This made me wonder why this happened. I at that time was aware that I had autism and my parents would tell me that it probably is due to my autism.

 Now that I'm older I understand myself a lot more. 
I've actually developed a certain talent. I have been able to reverse engineer my thoughts and reverse engineer my ""findings"" I've been able to analyze myself at will. 
For example when I find myself wondering about something I can dive into a clear moment and ask myself why I wonder such things. I call it answering my own questions. I'll tell you a bit about how this came to be.
Not only as a child but even now things that are so normal to others are so hard to understand.

 For example things that are polite. 
Saying please, laughing about jokes that you don't actually find that funny, telling nice things even though you think differently, listening to things that don't interest you.
I have a girlfriend which I love very much, we've been together for 1 year and 7 months now and as everyone is aware; a teenage girl has her insecurities. 
Women have a way of figuring out what you truly think about her that they deem to be as accurate as possible. Women put men to the test by asking things or saying things and thus trying to fish out a certain response from a man. Your response they will translate back into something that they can work with to see how you think about certain things. This is widely considered difficult to understand by man and also a subject men like to joke about with other men.

To me however these ""mind games"" are even more difficult. As many others with autism would agree we have a lot of trouble reading your mind. By reading your mind I mean to say reading your emotions from your face, or maybe body language and make up what you think. I have a hard time understanding my girlfriend when she tries to make a point to me through those ""mind games"" as I take things too literate. Sarcasm for example is a concept hard to reach for me. It makes no sense why you would say something that you don't mean to tell them the opposite.
Not being able to understand things is a scary thing. You question yourself; are you the only one who does this?
What do others think.

And that's how I started to wonder; and I still do. I always wonder what people think, during bus rides I'm always wondering what goes on through other people's mind.
Is it just as chaotic in your mind? Can you make a blank mind? How does it feel to make a blank mind? Are you also thinking about so much stuff? How does it feel to not have autism? Is there a difference when you're not doing anything? What do you think about when you're listening to a song? Do you listen to the lyrics? Trying to read the notes?
So many questions that run through my head when I'm wondering. And this is just one example. I wonder a lot and due to this I was eventually able to catch myself wondering, and I would wonder why I wonder about such things. And I would even catch myself looking for patterns, which sometimes I did. I try to look for patterns to what people do. For example how a mother reacts to her child that's in an annoying mood. And I wonder why she reacts to her child in that way, I would wonder what would happen if you were to react in another way. I would wonder how I would be with kids and how I would react in such a situation. And then I'd catch myself wondering about that. And I'd wonder why I'm wondering about that; It's because I do not understand.

I don't understand and I cannot predict people who aren't like me. What makes so much sense to them doesn't to me. And what does't make sense to them makes so much sense to me.
This however doesn't always apply. For example captchas, senseless scrambled data. I always find myself cycling through the captchas till I find one that's easy to understand. Sometimes captchas are so horrible I need someone else to do it for me because I keep failing and then the system locks me out for a couple of minutes.

Patterns have been making up a big part of my life. They help me solve things that otherwise are too difficult. For example simple maths. A sum like 34 + 18 takes me a couple of minutes to figure out. Or analog clocks, they still freak me out and eventually I give up. Though if I have a paper in front of me with all numbers ranging from 1 to 100 in lets say a block, I would be able to solve it very easily as I have a system I can detect patterns in. the same applies to language, I have a hard time learning my native language (Dutch) which is quite a hard language on the area of grammatics. But there are patterns in sentences, there are certain rules that apply every single time and they appear to be recursive. When I need to solve them independently I however find myself unable to do it.

Back to my self analyzing talent;
There's a certain way how I make ideas and discoveries. There are certain ways how I learn myself things and I caught myself doing so. This is again through patterns. Code for example when I'm programming makes sense because I visualize the code in my head. I always see everything as an engine. and engines have patterns. This cog goes there, that wheel goes here and those bolts keep this right over there while this band makes this spin. Engines aren't so different from each other, there's always a pattern, so I visualize blocks of code like parts that form an engine together. When I do this I only have to put in little effort to understand things. And I caught myself doing this with more. Everything that is difficult to understand I take apart, form into parts and after that try to assemble it like an engine. And then things make sense. Then I can see what makes what do what. Things at that point are easy because I get to see them do what they do without physically doing anything. What also happens is things are easier to analyze, when there is an error I'll find where it is. 
For example in code there is a common mistake of leaving out a semi-colon. This is necessary to end a code line and when left out it will create confusing errors. I will notice if a semi-colon is left out easily because there is a symbol missing in the pattern. And I know where it belongs.
I taught myself something people with autism find difficult; and that is questioning. I'm able to explain myself right now because I spent so much time questioning why other people do certain things a certain way but mainly why -I- do certain things a certain way.

As I grew older I started to grow an interest for myself. It seemed like something obvious that I would know I. I mean it's me, I know myself inside out!
But as I started to wonder I made questions. 
I knew that I did not understand others, but how well did I understand myself?.. 
This lead to a whole new chapter in my life I guess.. 
I grew a tremendous interest for the biggest mystery I've ever witnessed: me. Why am I different? It's Autism. But what -IS- Autism and what makes people with Autism different, why do I not understand what they understand and why do they not understand what I understand. I found myself questioning myself more than I questioned the others. And I don't 
really yet understand myself completely, but I came a long way. I learnt that understanding things is 
something important to me, I need to understand things and I want to understand more things. 
I learnt that understanding people is a vital thing for me. For example my dog; I love my dog with all of my heart because I understand him.
He doesn't talk and he doesn't have obvious facial expressions, but I understand him in how he does because he does't send false information, if he doesn't like something he will make sure I know, and if he likes something he'll show me!
I even find myself talking to my dog, things like I do now on this forum. 
I talk to him about my questions and he doesn't talk back but he listens. 
And sometimes when I do I find myself answering my own questions.

My autism is stronger than me. 
And if there's something I learnt from all of this by now it's that I shouldn't be doing what I was told to do.
I shouldn't fight against my autism. 
Instead I fight alongside it. 
Autism is not what made me weak, it's what made me strong.
Now, /Autism/ do you recognize yourself in this? Do you wonder and do you self-analyze? Or do you know someone?

I'd love to hear your story and if you read all of this then I'd like to thank you for reading mine.
Thanks.

149,"Autism, Patterns and Self analyzing","Hi, I'm bobdesau.

I have autism and you might recognize me from my previous post.
I recently decided to share what I ""discovered"" about my autism, patterns and self-analyzing.

As you might know from my previous post I have the talent of programming because of my autism.
A big part of programming is patterns.
Information that look scrambled but has a sense of order behind it; patterns.
As a young kid I got into programming and patterns.
Recently I programmed an encrypter and decrypter with an encryption based on one that I as a young child could solve without the need of the decrypter or the encryption key because it contained a pattern.
Then there are regular expressions in programming and as a kid they fascinated me, they also consist out of a bunch of characters which at first look like just a mess of characters but to me they made sense.

Here is an example of a regular expression:

/^.+\@.+\..+$/

another one:

/(?=.*.{6,})(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)/

I was able as a kid to figure the patterns out that existed in these strings of ""data""
the start and end with the forwards slashes, the continues use of certain symbols used after or before certain symbols
These are just tiny regular expressions but I've worked with expressions that were a lot longer that I wouldn't get lost in easily.

This made me wonder why this happened.
I at that time was aware that I had autism and my parents would tell me that it probably is due to my autism.
Now that I'm older I understand myself a lot more.

150,My son has been diagnosed with autism—and it hit me like a brick at first.,"My son is now 2.7 years old and two months ago we received the final diagnosis that he has autism.  I had an inkling that he was showing signs, but was in a state of denial.  That is until we received the official report.  He has been enrolled with Speech and Occupational Therapy for about nine months.   It was the therapist that recommended we get him evaluated—and we did.  Now I don't see this as a set back.  It is a challenge.  The main obstacle I have now is communication. He doesn't speak one word, but has a few hand gestures that we understand.  He is a loving boy who regularly will hug and “kiss” my wife, son, and his therapists.  He likes stacking blocks and playing with wheel coasters. Oh, and he loves slides and swings.  Loves to look at lights and HATES loud noises. The communication issue is rough/troubling.  He cannot tell us if he hurts or is in pain, cannot tell us if he does or doesn't want to go some where.  We take him to a great daycare where the therapists go to work with him.  We noticed some good improvement since we have taken him there.  He now accepts when other children try to play with him, even though he doesn't pay them much attention.  For television shows he loves Micky Mouse club house, Dora the explorer, and  Handy Mandy.  We are currently trying to get an ABA therapist to go to his daycare—but the ours depends on what my insurance will pay :( . He is still a picky eater!  Only eats a blended vegetable soup with some cereals mixed in, fried crunchy stuffs, pringles sour cream and chive, and the occasional cheese pizza slice. Sorry for the rambling—I just needed to get this out.  Thanks for reading.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1t5gus/my_son_has_been_diagnosed_with_autismand_it_hit/,124
151,"Care giver of deaf autistic woman, struggling with purposeful urination","We've been talking to her therapists etc. but because she is also deaf, and nobody has really worked with her signing, communication is extremely difficult, and to my knowledge a game plan hasn't yet been made. It would be most lovely if someone had some advice as to how to handle this. 

My family and I are EFH providers and one of our residents is an adult woman who has, for the past month or so, been using purposeful urination to try to get her way and go to bed regardless of the time.

Our nights typically go like this: 

After dinner (usually around 5:30-6) she will immediately wet herself. She eats VERY fast (we've also been working on that) and when she is finished she usually puts her dishes away, and then goes and sits on the couch. Then, after a minute or so, she will wet herself while looking back at us, and then will come back to the table and grab and pull each of us one by one (while we are still eating) wanting to be changed into PJs and put to bed.

Tonight we had an early dinner (a little before 5) and I decided to try having her sit with us at the table until we were ALL finished. Then everyone, including her, went to the kitchen to put our dishes in the washer, and it wasn't even a minute later while she was standing between my mom and I in the kitchen that I looked down and saw a puddle at her feet. She then did her usual grabbing and pulling to be changed and put to bed. This was just shy of 5:30. 

She also wets the bed every single morning before she gets up. We get up at 6 am, but when she goes to bed so early she will wet around 4am sometimes even 3, and then go around and get the whole house up, which is obviously a problem. She takes medication for night time bedwetting, the doctors have increased her dose 3 times and it hasn't yet worked, which is why I am assuming (although not positive) that she wets the bed while awake as well.

Other than those two times, before bed and in the morning, she goes to the restroom on her own without prompting and has no accidents. 

I know the professionals are the ones to be talking to about this, and I assure you we have been, but it would be amazing if some of you had some advice for my family and I on how to handle this in the mean time.

153,Ambivalent about whether my 6-year old will ever be verbal,"So I don't read much about autism, even in this forum. I guess I feel like I live it every day and for some reason I avoid reading about it.  I've never posted anything about autism anywhere. But reading the [Jim Sinclair article ] (http://www.autreat.com/dont_mourn.html) /sitethief submitted this week really spoke to me, and raised some questions.

I come from a super-verbal family, and my eldest son, 9, is absurdly verbal as well (he recently corrected me ""that's not weird, dad; it's merely unsual.""). Getting to know my younger son, who is 6, has been an adventure. He has a little receptive language (""pick it up,"" and maybe ""give it to mommy,"" on occasion), but uses no words at all, and not much pointing even. He runs around dances to his own beat, eats paper and throws food on the floor and spits and stims on just about everything (including my head, when he sits on my shoulders, which is often).

After 4 years of school, speech and ABA therapy, etc., I'm honestly not sure I care if he'll ever be verbal - even though we keep taking him to appointments, etc. (we're starting a new augmentative speech program with Ipads at a clinic next month).

It's a really weird feeling to think that I don't think I'd give him a ""cure autism"" pill even if such a thing existed. Why? He's the happiest person I know. He has some sleep issues, and sleeps in our bed in the master bedroom, but even when he wakes up at 3 am he laughs and jumps up and down on the bed and wants to play. It's friggin' infectious! He bonds well with me, my wife, our older son, and others. He used to scratch and even bite fairly regularly, but now doesn't do it hardly at all, even when upset.

I worry. About if he'll learn to potty train, or use a fork much or put on clothes by himself. I know this is important. And I want him to be more independent. And I'm really scared silly about how we'll deal with his puberty. But my wife and I are pretty content, I think, with the idea of him always living with us, and are blessed with an extended family to help give him 24/7 care at our home, at least for the next few decades.

The thing is that he makes me happier every single day. He is joyous, authentic, alive and present.  **And I kind of wonder why I'd want to even try to fix him?**

I know that there's a lot of strong opinions out there about these issues, and I'm not really political about all that. I have no axe to grind. I'm also not really sentimental (I'm a litigation attorney!). I don't want anyone to think I'm somehow being noble or accepting or setting some f---ing example from an after-school special. I just feel like my son has taught me more about non-verbal communication, about non-verbal *being* than I ever thought possible. He inspires me daily even as he exhausts me, my wife, and our family.

I worry that by idealizing my son, it will help me justify my enduring laziness in not working with him much on life skills (brushing teeth by himself, picture exchange, etc.) he really needs. I'm much better just playing with him than I am at teaching him stuff.

I guess I wonder if other parents with a totally non-verbal child have struggled with these issues. I also wonder if any folks out there with autism have any thoughts or suggestions on what I've expressed.

Sorry if this is rantish and disconnected. I just don't know how to feel. 

I kind of think my son is perfect as he is - and simultaneously realize that this can't be true and that he needs me to get off my ass and teach him all the things that he just can't learn like other kids.

Okay so I have been hearing mixed messages about the validity of Oxytocin as a possibly effective medication for Asperger's and High functioning Autism. Would it be very likely counterproductive if I decided to buy some of it online and do some [thorough, well thought] experiments with a sort of fusion therapy regimen of marijuana(I'm pretty sure some variant of heavy Sativa would be better suited than indica, hopefully with some Ruderalis bred in as well,) in joints (not blunts,) with some liquid oxytocin lacing?

156,Need help with an education question in Virginia.,"My nephew is 5 years old and has been diagnosed with Autism, his doctor's consider him 'moderate functioning' though I really can't tell you exactly what that means. 

I need your help. My nephew is currently enrolled in public school in Northern Virginia. He also receives ABA and speech therapy through Tricare. He started this year in Norfolk city schools and after a issue with the schools down there, (they dropped him off with a neighbor that wasn't on the list becuase my sister was not home,) we brought him up here.

My nephew has made leaps and bounds through ABA and speech therapy and as such has begun participating in speech therapy every Thursday for the whole day. He has doctor's records and notes verifying that all of this is medically necessary for him. Tuesday's he has ABA which also helps him out a lot. 

The school is now trying to force my mother and sister into taking him out of all of these to comply to the ""truancy"" guidelines. We have been told several times that they can not force him to forgo his therapy, but I can not find where this is written as law. The school has not gone so far as to threaten law enforcement intervention but I am concerned they will eventually. The school's attendance official is very curt and rude, she seems to care not at all for the fact he needs this therapy and it is doctor ordered. She has been very rude to my mother and my sister. 

I need your help on how to deal with this. He doesn't actually make much progress in school and actually fights going to class. (Which raises a whole different set of flags for me, but I digress.) I don't want this attendance lady, who clearly doesn't understand that the ADA applies to children with Autism as well, but I have no idea where to start. 

Help? Please?

tl;dr -- My nephew is Autistic and goes to speech and ABA therapy twice a week, he misses all day Thursday in pubic school. The school is threatening my mother and sister saying that he has to give up this doctor order therapy and come to school...which he doesn't like and makes very little progress in. This all sounds like a stack of fracking dog poo to me and I need your help. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1sxwrh/need_help_with_an_education_question_in_virginia/,129

159,"Sensory seeker, sensory sensitive friend?(cross post with r/ ADHD and r/aspergers)","Hello all. I have ADHD. Like many ADHD people, I sometimes NEED sensory input. It can calm me when I am hyper, and also ground me back in the real world when I'm being ""floaty"". 

I also often talk to myself, sometimes because I am daydreaming and sometimes because I am compensating for poor executive function ( for example, talking myself through the steps needed to gather my laundry, get my money, and then actually take my laundry to the... Washing place. Can't remember the name right now.)

This can annoy other people, especially sine one of my roommates is an aspie with sensory sensitivity. Right now, I just STOP jangling my keys and talking to myself, but that can make it harder for me to function myself (especially with talking to myself to get things done. It bothers my roommates and they keep telling me to stop because it distracts them from their work, but I have a REALLY hard completing even basic tasks without it. For example, I started trying to get my laundry done at 10 am today. I got to the laundry room at 5 pm. And I haven't really gotten much else done.)


I would like advice on ways to get myself more sensory input. I would also appreciate suggestions on how to balance my needs with those of my roommates.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1swcps/sensory_seeker_sensory_sensitive_friendcross_post/,132
160,Advice to parents and school services,"I work at a public school in IL. Currently we are denying a young child the right to a spot they qualify for in an Autism training program. Said child would still be in our classroom, but with the additional program to help them flourish and be more independent when the child gets older. We do not have the money to send that child (yet spent thousands on bus routing software that is unnecessary in a small town), so the administration is only sending a few kids and waiting out the other ones until they are out of our school system. THIS IS ILLEGAL. 

I tried talking to the parent who didn't fully understand, but was reprimanded by my superiors. I will lose my job if I bring it up again to truly bring home the severity of the issue. I am currently looking for a new job, and when I get it, the first thing I'm going to do is let that parent know how badly we are screwing her child over. Also the fact that the coordinator giggled and said just tell her no, the child doesn't qualify, when asked about what to tell the parents angered me. 

Also, this child is in desperate need of an aide, but is denied one because of not wanting to pay for one. Her language and training to be more independent would skyrocket with one. It's so depressing to know we're not doing all we can.

The reason I'm sharing this is because parents need to know they should know their child's rights and to question the schools if they don't think they're doing enough for your child. Know what is illegal to withhold, and inquire more about when things are brought up, but then are suddenly taken off the table. Schools are cutting corners everywhere, and that includes special needs services. I know schools are in a bad state everywhere, but some things cross the line. It is why I plan on leaving the education system ASAP.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1suqmu/advice_to_parents_and_school_services/,133
161,"I'm undiagnosed, but relate heavily to a lot of accounts of ASD/AS. A couple of questions for you...","Hi all,

I first became aware of the possibility of my being mildly autistic a few years ago, and it's recently come to my attention again as I came out of a long period of alcoholism and drug abuse. Whilst self-diagnosis is generally not a constructive thing (I got a bit of a slap on the wrist from my counsellor today,) I just can't bloody help it. The more I read, the more things I relate to.

I described to her (and another counsellor last year,) that I have a constant sensation in my mind for which there is no name. I said it was like a buzzing, she asked for further clarification. The term I arrived at was 'everything at once.' I held my arms out to describe a halo or energy field around my head. 'Everything at once.' That's all I can really say to describe it at this point. As I put more time between myself and my last drink/smoke (marijuana,) this feeling has become more pronounced, or I've become more aware of it. 
Is this a commonly reported symptom of ASD/AS, or can anybody relate? 

I also have a tendency to stare at several mandala-like objects I have amassed; the center of a Persian rug I bought, the middle of the spiral UV banner I use as a curtain. With sustained attention, the areas on the outside appear to move/breathe. I first noticed this when I was perhaps 10 years old, staring at a single blade of grass on a football field until the undulations of the pitch became apparent and moved against each other, like tectonic plates. I feel it's important to mention this as evidence that it isn't (just,) a product of having taken hallucinogens in my teens/early to mid 20s. Is this something that could be considered an autistic trait, or is it something else entirely?

I have an appointment on the 9th of January for an official assessment, though my counsellor urged me to see a psychiatrist before then. She's recommended I not become too immersed in searching for answers at this point, but... I can't help it. I get the impression that many reading this might understand.

I had another question, and I know it was awesome and relevant, but it's gone. I could write pages and pages about the experiences I've had or the percieved presence of symptoms, but I'll have to leave it there or I'll write a novel. Any insight would be appreciated.

Anyway, like a year ago I had a breakdown and started seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist. I brought my thoughts up and they made me fill in a questionnaire (aswell as my parents) which would determine if I had autism or not.

They said I had autism (albeit lightly) after reviewing it.

""I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a disability - to try to help people who have not shared that unique experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel. It's like this......

When you're going to have a baby, it's like planning a fabulous vacation trip - to Italy. You buy a bunch of guide books and make your wonderful plans. The Coliseum. The Michelangelo David. The gondolas in Venice. You may learn some handy phrases in Italian. It's all very exciting.

After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives. You pack your bags and off you go. Several hours later, the plane lands. The stewardess comes in and says, ""Welcome to Holland.""

""Holland?!?"" you say. ""What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life I've dreamed of going to Italy.""

But there's been a change in the flight plan. They've landed in Holland and there you must stay.

The important thing is that they haven't taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease. It's just a different place.

So you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people you would never have met.

It's just a different place. It's slower-paced than Italy, less flashy than Italy. But after you've been there for a while and you catch your breath, you look around.... and you begin to notice that Holland has windmills....and Holland has tulips. Holland even has Rembrandts.

But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy... and they're all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And for the rest of your life, you will say ""Yes, that's where I was supposed to go. That's what I had planned.""

And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away... because the loss of that dream is a very very significant loss.

But... if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things ... about Holland.""",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1sm3pm/welcome_to_holland_a_beautiful_poem_depicting_a/,137

I know Reddit is quite pro-vaccine, and I hear all the time about the flawed and debunked autism-vaccine study. I watch Penn and Teller's Bullshit episode on vaccines, and I see people ""poo-poo"" any casual connection between vaccines and autism.

But then I come across a site like [this](http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html), and I become confused. It appears to be heavily cited, with over 60 papers and studies that present a connection between various types of vaccines and ADS (austism spectrum disorder).

I am the mom to a 2.3 year old boy dx'ed with PPD-NOS. 

On Friday when he was with his Occupational Therapist (at my place, he usually gets therapy at the day care) I witnessed the worst tantrum *ever*. 

It is triggered when something he *really* wants is taken away. Generally, if something is taken he will whine but usually I give him a stern ""look"" and he calms down. 

The OT was trying to lure him to sit at his little table with her phone and when she wouldn't give it to him...holy moly 30 minutes of kicking and screaming to the point that he was shaking and had no appetite for about an hour after she left. 

I don't know if his tantrums are worsened by the ""terrible twos"" stage, or if this is going to be an ongoing thing.

Some info on him:

- 2 years 3 months old

- good eye contact

- affectionate 

- mostly non-verbal, gargles his words and refuses to be corrected (ex: I ask him, ""This is JUICE! Can you say JUICE? JUUUICE!"" Him: ""WAH"" and throws himself on the floor)

I cannot keep him away from friends and family, and I know I shouldn't care if people judges me/him when he throws these tantrums, but I would love any advice to help calm him/prevent it without giving him his way. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1sjqec/i_need_tantrum_help/,140

172,Need help/bouncing off my thoughts to you guys on my Autistic brother.,"Forgive me if I sound terribly ignorant, or I offend anyone (not my intent here), but I have a 10 year old Autistic brother. He was diagnosed at the age of 2 or 3, and ever since then we've just accepted that he has Autism. We have him go through ABA therapy and have been for a while now, ever since I can remember really (I'm 17). However, he has made little to no progress. He is obviously non-verbal, but all of the stories that I've read and heard about, even with severly Autistic children, it seems as if they are doing better than he is. He is 10 years old and the most complex sentence he will say is ""I want water/food/french fries."" Now I understand that's a pretty big acehivement, especially since there is some actual attempt at communicating. However, I don't know how to get him to excel any more than that. My whole family is quite busy, so sadly we don't ever have that much time to spend with him. We try and do it as much as we can, but mostly the ABA therapists are the ones that are making the most progress with him. For the past couple of months, he has taken to making this loud humming sound constantly, only pausing to take breaths, for hours on end throughout the whole entire day. It has gotten to the point where it is mentally AND physically exhausting (never in my life did I think a single sound can have that affect on my psyche). Any idea on how to make him stop this? It's brought me to tears many more times than I care to admit, and has had me, and my whole family feeling like we are going insane. And he also breaks things. On purpose. He will break the item and then points and goes ""break,"" and then laughs. No matter how many times we tell him it's a bad thing, I feel like he still doesn't understand the meaning, or just flat out doesn't care. Any way to get him to understand not to do this? The reward/punishment system doesn't really work for him that much anymore as he has gotten to the point where he is VERY stubborn. I was recently thinking that maybe it's a cry for attention, but now I'm not so sure anymore because he does it even when he has all the attention he could possibly need. Any ideas on how to help better his social skills and his life in general? Thanks so much.

* Edit: I should also point out, that any time I try helping him learn something - such as the difference between the colors blue and green for instance - he will try for maybe 10 seconds and then just start crying and screaming and won't pay any attention to me, before I've even had a chance to do or say anything else. I don't know how else to teach him anything. I have tried many different ways besides the traditional sit and learn because I understand he might learn in other ways that he could also enjoy, but still nothing has worked. He really does not excel in anything, and has no other interests but going on walks, eating McDonalds (barely eats anything anymore unless its McDonalds. We have tried not giving him McDonalds, and he went a whole day and a half resisting to eat ANYTHING else we gave him that fit his diet, before finally caving in).",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1sfjn5/need_helpbouncing_off_my_thoughts_to_you_guys_on/,52

179,I have a question about my brother. He's almost 18 and was diagnosed in 2000 with HFA.,"He was diagnosed when he was 2 years old. My mom blames the vaccines but that's an argument for another day. 

Honestly after reading some comments here I'm not sure he has HFA at all, but a more severe form of autism. 

1. He does not know he has autism. He cannot recognize others with it or any other disability. 

2. He is very well behaved, no tantrums, no acting out. 

3. He takes regular classes and gets A's and B's. 

4. When he was younger he used to line up toys, stimulate himself by bouncing and throwing toys, bouncing balls constantly, etc. He has grown out of all of that for the most part. He still holds things in his hands and throws them up in the air. He'll change which objects he throws, right now he's using those rubber band bracelets. 

5. He goes through phases of talking about certain things a lot. Right now he has about 3 ""stories"" that he will constantly bring up many times throughout the day. It's sort of like his ""conversation starter."" He also talks to himself about these stories. 


6. He is currently learning how to drive and might be getting a license in the next 4 months. 



**My question:** does he have HFA? Do people with HFA usually realize they have autism? Sorry if I seem insensitive here, it's just I'm wondering if my mom has been playing down the severity of his autism to everyone. She says he's ""A 1 on a scale of 1-10.""

184,Improving families' quality of life with a child with Autism.," 
My research partner and I are graduate students completing our degrees in Marital and Family therapy. I am currently working with children with autism and am interested in conducting research to better serve my current clients and their families. As the older sibling of a brother with Down syndrome who has always required additional support at home and in school, the idea of supporting the family in therapy has always been important to me and drew me to this work.

The current information available on the subject of autism is mainly concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of the child. However, some literature suggests that re-focusing on supporting the family in treatment in addition to supporting the child can assist in improvement of family satisfaction and quality of life. 

By having parents/guardians complete our survey we hope to gather unique family experiences and perspectives of life satisfaction to better understand and serve families with an Autistic member(s) in our current and future work.

186,I'm at a loss about how I should interact with autistic people,"Backstory: Ok, so, this last week I was a part of a program where a local music lessons place sets up young musicians, like myself, in rock bands with other musicians to cover a few songs and play a gig. I've been doing things like this for a while, so it was pretty familiar. But this time, a young, I'd say 8-10 year old boy, a drummer, was a part of the program. He clearly had some sort of mental issue, I hesitate to put a label on it but something that made him operate in a way that would be deemed ""normal"" in a social setting. I really didn't have much of a chance to interact with him, but during a water break I sat down and he came by and waved, I waved back. I tend to be really awkward with people I'm not familiar with, and with people with mental disabilities I'm at a loss of what to do so it gets worse. He asked me what I was doing for Thanksgiving, and I told him I was going to my grandparents'. He excitedly said that he was also going to see his grandparents. I smiled and asked him is he was excited for the gig, since I didn't know what else to say, and he smiled and said that he was very excited, jumped around a bit, and walked back to his group's room. I know this little vignette of a story probably doesn't mean much to most anyone else, but it got me wondering if it's wrong of me to feel awkward interacting with people like him, and how I should interact with these people. I don't have anything wrong with people with autism and other developmental issues, I just don't know how to interact with them correctly. Any tips?

tl;dr: What guidelines, if any, or tips are there for interacting with people who have autism or other similar disabilities?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1rp65j/im_at_a_loss_about_how_i_should_interact_with/,154

191,Do any of you parents know any place for shelter and or job finding anywhere in the United States for people with mild autism?,"Ok I am in a very tight situation and may be homeless in about a few days or atleat on watch and really need to find a place to stay and look for work. 

My father, has been taking control over my life, with trying to deal with issues with my Landlord and and just other things in general, even financially. He has been isolating me and even threaten to lock me up and told me that he would drug me and has tried to get me on SSI to be my payee, even his girlfriend has also been a part of this madness as well. For many years, he has isolated me, abused me, tried to use me as slavery (take advantage of me), while my health issues has been neglected with not much food to eat with rags for cloths. I had found this out when he has statred to control things around me by a small mistake he has made, along with other signs of abuse and control. 

He has Antisocial Personality Disorder and I do have proof of documents so you should know that he is NOT trying to do what's best for me, or anything in that manner. Plus with these issues I had said above ^, its pretty sure that its not some missunderstanding or anything like that. I had been abused sexually, phsychologically, physically, and used as a pawn by him for a many years so please to bring that up that I am just a missunderstood person because of her autism, I really need some help and tired of people dissing me to the side because of it. If you are going to say anything rude or anything in that manner, please don't write anything because I am speaking the truth and and do know what I am talking about. 

I am 21 currently with not much of a good educational backround. and not been employed ever because of the SSI stuff. I had been quite nieve for a while but I am fed up with him and I don't really have any extended family where I can go to do think of something to get back on my feet. 

I do apoligize if this may sound a bit graphic but I really need to find some sources in this Country, I don't mind moving, I just need a place and get all the sources I could find. I am also going to call 211 in the state of California to get any sources but I need to get as much as I can, just incase I get denied. 

I should also mention that I am 21 and female, I did say that above but its just for organized records really. 

As for my mother, I don't know where she is. She left me and my brother at 13 and slowly drove insane and left in a city which I forgot. Even if I ask her for help, she will drive even more trouble than my father. She also is a drug abuser and can't control her impulses sexually so she is not capable of helping or taking care of me. 

I don't have any clsoe friends either, recently they had all turned against me and found some stuff about them, after I actually helped them with their problems so don't bother asking. The only friends that I do have are in other States, and would not mind moving like I had said above. 

I hope you can help and please if you find any programs, PM me.

194,I work in a life skills classroom. One of our students who experiences autism passed away last night. Let me tell you how amazing he was.,"The first time I met this young man, he was in his favorite spot: the therapy swing. I'm sure many of you know what I'm talking about but for those who may not, the therapy swing is like a big bag made out of basketball shorts (same material anyway). Anyway, he loved that swing. It was his reward for getting all his work done and it was his safe haven when he was upset. He was always humming, he loved the vibrations in his sinuses. The humming changed depending on his mood so we always knew when he wasn't feeling well. Sometimes, he would hit and kick at us but how else do you show you're upset if you can't speak? I never once felt any anger towards this amazing guy, there was a special quality to him, something that made him impossible to stay mad at. When he did something wrong, he would look up at you with his big, brown eyes with as a clear an ""I'm guilty"" looks as I've ever seen; and it never failed to calm my frustration and help him feel safe. He loved straws too, they were his favorite stim object. he would roll them delicately between his fingers, staring intently at them the whole while. Sometimes, his love of straws was problematic as he would, on occasion, attempt to take them from our drinks or from the garbage. He also greatly enjoyed eating them when he felt upset. But, like I said, he was impossible to stay mad. His face was usually blank, his eyes locked in a thousand-yard stare; but sometimes, when he was feeling good, he would smile and you could see the joy in his eyes. My last day with him, he wore that smile frequently. I will forever be grateful that my final memories of him are so positive. I will miss this young man's presence in my life and I know that he will be greatly missed by the rest of the staff and students at our school. While I cannot share names, for obvious reasons, keep this boy's family in your thoughts. He was well loved and well cared for and they are hurting right now. I thank those of you who took the time to read this and hear some of this guy's story, he was truly a soul worth remembering.

When I have ice cream no matter how upset I am or how much I'm crying, As soon as I have ice cream I feel better.

 I start smiling even if I have had a panic attack, suddenly I'm fine. 
Also when I consume Powerade, in about oh 15 minutes after it's been consumed, Suddenly my face will start smiling uncontrollably.

 I've even tried frowning and I can't get my face to frown or be upset, I realize this sounds like a good thing, but it feels akward and It feels strange.
 Is it normal to feel this way? Do any of you get this too or something similar? 

I also experience with Powerade that all of a sudden, I actually feel happier on the inside as well, like my body is smiling inside. 
 Not only that but all of a sudden I start laughing and making jokes. The strangest thing is that everything looks really colourful.

200,"hey, just come across this, i have autism, let me tell you my story the best i can :)","sorry that this is long, but it be worth it i suppose :)

Hey, just come across this not sure how to take this or even start

let me start off by saying my names lewis, i found out i had autism when i was 12. 

lets start from highschool(in th uk) i was 12(year 7), trying so hard to fit in with people but it never seemed to work out how i wanted it to be planned. i got bullied from a very young age because i was 'diffrent' and i hated it because i didnt know why or what i had to make me feel diffrent from others i was just doing my work and minding my own business

i never had friends, i always stuck with family family comes first i always say, ive had girlfriends but they have never accepted me for who i really am, the real me, they have always just brushed off 'i have autism' i want a girl to accept my autism and we can work together with it, not around it? you get me :/ 



anyways, in year 9, i quit school, i was getting bullied that bad that even the head teacher just baisicly said he couldnt protect me or my saftey because i had autism i had no sense of danger so it was alot harder for me to see, and i just wanted out, i never wanted to go to school i always came up with excuses so 

my mum home educated me, best thing thats ever happend to me in a sense, because i loved it, because i was doing work when i didnt even know. it was more life skills then anything? like go to the shop and get some milk or something? its money.. so thats maths... open up a bank that kinda stufff.. anyways im going off topic lol 

but the bad things is while i was in year 9 i was doing my 'choices' and i was half way doing a college course with the school (you would get what i mean if your in the uk not sure if you guys have it in the us) but when i quit school i then had to stop the college course and it really got to me coz i enjoyed it and it was keeping me going, the school wouldnt let me back in because it was apart of the school the shcool only did it obv ive left blah blah, took my mum 3months to get me back into the college course thing i was doing with school, i was with the same school people but i wasnt attacted to the school so i could do what i like while the other people had to listen to the school ta person who was with them i loved it haha 


when i quit school i had no gcse's at all and i some how got into a entry level 1 in a college course doing english maths and it, i had no idea how (my mum worked at a as a bar maide in the local pub and they all raised money doing a pool tourniment) i was like wow so tthats how i got into college some how got in college with no gsce's i guess my mum paid for my first year, i was only 16...

i then got all though college and got a level 1 english maths and it. i was so happy and so was my mum because i had something behind me.

i tried level 2 half way though level 2, i got bullied again, people turning my pc off while half way though doing something, i got shoved against a wall and got held up with my neck, my little finger broke because i tired to defend myself and everything was just becoming shit again like another school year for me all over again 

i talked to mum, my mum agreed to not going back she was happy with me i had something behind me i have a level 1 english and maths and the doctor told my mum when i was born i wouldnt be able to read or write or even talk and now look at me :) so ye my mum was happy i got something behind me...


but now here i am, 2/3years laters. worrying about my future and what i wanna do in life. i dont go out, i dont have friends, i dont have a gf...

I walked downstairs and got  nasally assaulted by the fucking candle and this horrible eucaplytus thing that leaked all over the counter that I can still smell three weeks later and it HURT. And I got angry because...it hurt. 

She knows that I can't deal with strong smells. She knows this, yet insists on using the most acrid, potent, holiday and just outright sinus clearing crap on earth. I don't know why - we keep a very clean house, there are lots of windows and we live in a place where the air is clean.

207,Fairly new to Autism,"I'm a 21/f and currently in nursing school. I don't know anyone in my family or extended family that has ever been diagnosed with Autism so this condition is fairly new to me (and mental health in general). During this past summer (in Cali), I got the chance to work as a counselor for adult and children's with disabilities. The whole experience gave me a better perspective of others and all kinds of people who have these known conditions such as down's syndrome, wide ranges of the autism spectrum, cerebral palsy, angelman's syndrome, and more.

There was this particular participant that I worked with, whom really opened my eyes about autism. I would say he has a moderate-severe autism. He was my age (21), non-verbal, caucasian, mobile but he was also 6'2, super handsome and looks like he could be an awesome basketball/football player. I learned a lot with just spending a day and a half with him. Although he was very particular and gets easily agitated, needs constant verbal cues and directions, there was so much more to him than having such disability. 

I learned that although he was sometimes aggressive when agitated, he was so sweet, caring, and gentle. There was an instance where he couldn't fix his sleeping bag zipper and a group of counselors tried to fix it for him with him waiting on the side anxiously and pacing. He started to get physically aggressive after a while up until he was okay with just folding it and putting it away. On the other hand, there was a time where I was tickling him for fun, which he enjoyed. At first he was not reacting to me but after a while, he asked to be tickled. It was so adorable! When he wanted my attention, instead of being aggressive, he would place his hand on my ever so slightly.

This experience also got me thinking about the what-if's. He was MY age, and looks so normal from an external view. He looked like he could be at a top tier college and have every girl in his hands. He looked like he could be a really good friend, boyfriend, student. Everything. With his condition, he wasn't like anyone else that seemed ""normal"" but he has all this amazing characteristics that not many people can see. 

I just love how those who have autism could be so genuine and lovable. Sorry, this is long but I just wish I new more people who are so not afraid to be who they are. I love this population, they all taught me so much about myself and who I want to be as a future nurse. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1quw7r/fairly_new_to_autism/,171
208,Picking Eater: Worth the battle?,"Hey /r/autism, you guys are always so much help, I've got another question.

My 2.5 year old with ASD is a picky eater, but it's situational.

There are days when he will eat things like spinach, or salsa and chips, or salad.  Then there are days where he will eat nothing but potato chips.  

And you know, I get it.  I get bored with food too.  I always try to give him options, I mix things up so it's not the same breakfast every day.

But when he started eating solid food, there was nothing he would turn down.  Around 18 months, he started phasing foods out.  It does not seem to be texture related because like I said, some days he will eat a particular food, and it's anathema other days.  

When he doesn't want to eat a food, he will rear back and whine and push the fork away.  If we persist, he will cry.  He is verbal, and we are trying to teach him to say ""not want"" or ""no thank you"" instead of crying.

The only food I have never seen him turn down is bacon.  

I do worry some days that he is not getting his nutritional needs met.

We've tried to show him two options and let him pick which food he'd like.  Very mixed results.  Sometimes he doesn't want either option.  Sometimes he clearly picks an option, but when it's on his plate, he's still displeased.

He is a pro at asking for cookies, milk, and hot dogs.  Those we have no problems with.  

He will also eat a wider variety of foods if he has a show on or the iPad, but that's a crutch I don't want to lean on.

Our SLP said to not even stress and just let him lead with what he'd like, but really... if we let him lead, he would eat nothing but cookies.  Should we be trying to expose him to foods or just let this ride for a while?  I've read some stuff about just putting food on his plate and letting him see that it's there and not pressuring.  We do this and as far as I can tell, there's no result.  

Any advice appreciated.  And I'd love to hear from adults on the spectrum too.  Is there any different way I can present him food that would be cool?  He's only 2.5, so we're still learning what makes him tick.  But there's a kid at his school who only likes white foods and there's another one who only likes square foods, so I'm always mindful of stuff like that.

Thanks very much!

Edit:  he does take a liquid vitamin.   so he is getting a lot of nutrients that way.

We've been seeing specialists multiple times per week and I've been doing my best to be the best mom I can for them. I love them to pieces and want the best for them. However, in the process, I've found myself also ticking symptoms off the list, not only for my
Children, but also for my husband. It would make so much sense and would explain so many things, including some ""odd"" communication issues (I say odd because I think everyone has communication issues at some point) we've had in the past. My question to you is do I keep this to myself or raise these concerns with the kids specialists? He's highly functional, doesn't need supervision or anything, definitely on the low end of the spectrum, however I feel like this might be helpful in helping our kids, yet, I don't want to bring this up to him. I think it would be devastating to him and might cause more problems than solve them. Please, no bashing, this is all so overwhelming for me. I really just need support. Sorry for the terrible English, it's my second language.

212,A little support,"My brother is Autistic. As most people with an autistic child or sibling can confirm, life has never been struggle free. We've been through so much. My parents lost their home about a year and a half ago and they are struggling to pay for my brother's numerous medications because he lost his medicaid. My parents try to shield me from what's going on, but when I think about the life that I get to lead, and the one my brother leads currently...well, it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. It seems like we've only encountered closed doors at every turn when it comes to his progress. Anyway. Getting to the point here. Tomorrow evening **(11/16/2013) at 7P.M.** my parents, relatives and all those who know of us are going to take a moment and pray, direct positive thoughts, good juju, well wishes and any other good feelings into the universe for my brother. Who's name is Senay, by the way. I'm new to reddit and I have never reached out to people about my brother before but if you have the time to stop and think a positive thought for my brother and family I would greatly appreciate it. I think that a response, even from one person would help restore their hope (and mine).

215,"How do I (as a socially anxious, insecure individual) date someone with autism? I desperately need advice, I think I could really like this guy.","I met a guy on Okcupid (I'm 21 years old, female, by the way). I think he's very attractive but the first date (that occurred a few days ago) went terribly. That might be an exaggeration (I think for anyone else it would be described as ""terrible,"" but I don't mind awkwardness) it was okay but we had extremely long bouts of silence. Every single line of conversation died rather quickly. We have common interests but he seems to have a lot of trouble maintaining a conversation and asking questions about me (or maybe he's just not interested). But he asked to see me again and I would like to. I'm just extremely anxious and I typically need a lot of reassurance from people that they actually are interested/like me or else I get rather paranoid and I know going into this I probably won't receive a lot of that.
I myself have trouble maintaining conversations . . . and I don't know what's worse: babbling like an idiot and ranting about things or just stewing in silence?

I'm really glad he was upfront with his autism in his profile but there was no discussion of it in person (I don't really need to discuss it but I honestly don't know how I would have handled anything if I wasn't aware that he had autism beforehand, I would have probably thought he despised me). 

I have never been close to someone with autism in the past. I have volunteered in the past to help students with severe autism but working with students vs. dating is very very different.

I must note that I have never been in a relationship before though I have dated many people (I very rarely find anyone I'm genuinely attracted to, I have difficulty connecting with people). Maybe I'm too fucked up to deal with this? I don't know. I don't know what to do at his point. If I were a more confident, decisive, assertive person I would feel much more comfortable pursuing this but I'm not (and I probably won't be for a long time).

In the past I have felt more comfortable with extroverted people because they can usually compensate for my lack of words (I'm very withdrawn sometimes) and make me feel more comfortable. I don't know how to feel comfortable with him but I want to be.

I don't know where his is on the spectrum, precisely, but his autism is very apparent with the way he speaks. 

Would it be weird to discuss this with him? I'm not sure if I should. 

Can two extremely introverted/shy people who are socially inept really work together? 

**TL;DR** Socially anxious girl meets autistic guy on dating website; uncertainty ensues. Should I continue dating him, is disaster inevitable? What should I know going into this? 

I realize I might sound extremely idiotic and/or ignorant. I would appreciate any and all advice especially from those with autism who have had dating experience. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1qmwd8/how_do_i_as_a_socially_anxious_insecure/,59

218,How are you paying for all the autism treatments/schools/therapist/life expenses? Single mom in desperate straits.,"I'm a single parent of an 8 year old and 10 year boy. My 10 year old son has HFA.  He is also aggressive -especially in group settings.   In our public school, he was kept in a 4x4 padded room for much of the school day. After 3 years of lawsuits, I finally gave up on public education.  Technically we ""won"" - but what we won were accommodations. And the school system just flatly refused to provide them or would provide them very poorly (like giving him one photocopied sheet to read himself instead of a 14 week program).  They knew what I knew now - that we would have to sue over every single instance and that he would age out before the cases were heard.

Luckily, a local therapist helped us and he is now in a small classroom, staffed with teacher/therapists at a private school, but I am running through his college fund to pay for it. I can pay for about 18 more months of the school.

My husband left when the kids were very small. It as very hard as my older child screamed, cried and hit all day every day and my younger child had colic and didn't sleep.  I moved to be near my parents and they have been very helpful.

My ex-husband pays $1300 a month in child care when he gets around to it. He is a CEO of company, but is excellent at hiding assets.  Also, at the time of the divorce, I was on pregnancy leave from a high paying job and that counted against me.  I have discussed suing him for more child support, but my attorney advised against it since he has few assets on paper. Due to the colic/HFA and move, I didn't have my job any more.  Once I moved I looked for a job and have tried doing consulting, but haven't had a lot of luck with either.

The several years of warfare with the schools (they would call for me to pick him up almost every day at random times - they had the schedule down so that he still counted as going full day - which meant that I couldn't complete a work day anywhere) took their toll on my career.   Plus I had no opportunity to network in our new town since I had only my parents to babysit. We tried to hire sitters/nannies, but no one could handle my HFA child.

I have now run through all my retirement. I own our home (used the proceeds from the home I paid off earlier in my career to buy this one) and I have a 10 year old minivan bought when I was pregnant with my oldest.

My son is doing much better now.  The new school environment and therapy have reduced his aggression by 95%. Unfortunately, it's not 100%, so he can't go into a regular classroom. Also, since there are only 2 teachers in his classroom, so if one is out and they don't have a back up therapist - school is cancelled. It doesn't happen a lot, but it does happen.

My parents help when they can, but they are older and not up to more than intermittent babysitting.  While my mom would accept us moving in with them, my dad pretty much won't. So selling the house and moving in with them is not a good option.

I am at a loss. I am just about out of money.  I don't know what to do about a job since I would fire me for missing work so much.

Any suggestions?

220,Kid-Aware Safety Bracelets,"Hello, fellow members and parents!

We are a five-element group who are all currently on the last year of a Master's Degree in Electronical Engineering. We are taking a course on Entrepreneurship which allows us to concebe and develop an idea for a product with a strong innovation and technological components.

Taking this into consideration, we would like to expose you all our project. We are working on a product directed at keeping young children safe and under control, which, as I am sure you all agree, is always a big concern and a major priority for every parent. Our product is Kid-Aware. It comprises of a pair of bracelets, one of which is worn by the child, and the other being used by you, the child's parent or legal guardian. When the child gets too far away from you, an alert is sounded on your bracelet, allowing you to be instantly notified if the child gets out of range. As we conceived it, this will serve as an extremely useful utility for casual walks outside or through the park and trips to the mall, the beach, countries abroad...

The maximum safety radius the child may wander off to can be configured manually, as well as the type of alarm (sound, vibration, blinking LED..). The parent bracelet may also be simply a smartphone App.

Further information can be found on our official web-site: www.kid-aware.com

We would like to ask you simply for feedback on what you think of this product and if you think it will be as useful as we imagine it would be. Also, we would be eternally grateful if you could help us better take your opinions into consideration by filling out the survey on the website.

We are posting here on this subreddit at the recommendation of a fellow parent on the parenting subreddit who suggested that this product could be particularly useful for children with special needs such as autism. This is something we hadn't originally considered, so we would very much like to hear what you have to say about this, so that we can better take into consideration the opportunities and challenges we might face while analyzing this particular case of the children who would use it.

We would very much appreciate your honest opinion and participation. Thank you very much!

223,Kentucky Sound Down,"Hello Reddit! I'd like to tell you all about a non profit organization my wife and I created, Kentucky Sound Down. We provide sensory friendly movie screenings in south eastern KY free of charge for families with special needs. We rent out a movie theater, turn the lights up and the sound down, provide snacks, and show a current, family friendly movie.

This all came about because my son was diagnosed with autism when he was almost 2. Along the journey, we realized it would be difficult for us to participate in many things, least of which was taking him to a movie. Toy Story 3 was coming out and it was our goal for him to be able to sit in the dark, loud theater. Well that didn't work, so we began putting ideas of having sensory friendly screenings together. A few years and a lot of hard work later, we have a non profit organization that does exactly what we set out to do. Currently we have had 7 movie showings, with an 8th coming at the end of the month

The reason I'm here: as you may imagine costs of running this organization can be expensive. We raise all money ourselves either through donating, or our annual auction we have. Last year was our first year with the auction and it was a big success. We had local merchants donate items and a few items from other places. This year, I'm looking to get items from different companies, celebrities, etc for the auction to increase awareness of the organization and hopefully bring in more bidder donations. If anyone would like to donate or supply items, or have questions, please contact me via either website contact or twitter below.

Any conversation we have cannot go one sentance without it. Any activity we do will not be pleasant without him having his handheld game and a constant streaming monolouge about it and everything he does in. He demands that we focus attention on him and his game all the time. If we are driving, he screams about needing to show us something on his game until we PULL OVER and look. And if he is being punished (using the only real thing we can take away from him) he screams about hating us, wishing we were dead, etc. I would love to say that we never give in to his ridiculous behavior, but sometimes he wears us to the bone and we relent. Of course this is enforcing and enabling his behavior, but for our sanity sometime we have little choice.

227,Testing for aspergers?,"My oldest child is 6 and was diagnosed as being on the spectrum at 4. Earlier this year they changed it to PDD-NOS. He is developmentally delayed with fine motor skills and speech. Every child that I have every previously had experience with that is on the spectrum had a more severe form of autism. I bring this up because I am very confused as to Aspergers and the signs of it. Best I can tell, the big difference is that it is a milder form of autism and language develops naturally (please pardon my ignorance, I'm still learning). 

My husband wants me to get our youngest child tested for autism. She is 3 and has a wide vocabulary. To me, she does not show most of the signs that my son does. She can look you in the eye, she doesn't seem lost in her own world much and she has no delays. However she does not play with other kids except her brother and sister, she does not talk to people outside of our immediate family and spends a lot of time running around and singing, hours in fact. She doesn't play much with toys either. She and my son are very close and seem to connect better than they do with their middle sister. 

I'm reluctant to have her seen by a developmental pediatrician because earlier this year she had a seizure and they instantly determined it was due to epilepsy, just because her brother has epilepsy. She does in fact have epilepsy, but they were saying that that is what it was before doing any kind of tests for infections, etc. I don't want a doctor to say autism just because she has a brother on the spectrum. If she is on the spectrum, ok, but I don't want someone to put her there just because her brother is.

Social story and rewards - he isn't conscious of the chewing so it doesn't work

Chew Toys (necklace, pen tip, stand alone) - works for a bit, then he usually finds a way to make it dangerous or just loses interest after 10 minutes.

Food (carrots, starburst, candy, dum dums) - He doesn't really like candy and usually throws the food after 2 minutes anyway.

Redirection - works for about five seconds


He honestly never complains about not getting to put things in his mouth, he just doesn't even seem to be able to control it.

231,Review: Dreamcatcher Weighted Blankets,"On September 28, 2013 I place an order for a 30lb full-size weighted blanket for myself in hopes it would help with decreasing intensity and duration of sensory shutdown and improve my length and quality of sleep. My service dog currently provides some deep pressure tasks for me, so I know this sort of thing helps me. I had to save up for several years to be able to afford this blanket.

When I placed my order, I was told it would take 3-4 weeks to get my blanket. Awesome, that's not too bad.

At the 4-week mark, I emailed the company and asked when they thought my blanket would ship out. I know stuff happens, but I wanted to make sure they hadn't forgotten about my order. I was told it would be made that week and shipped out by the end of the week. Okay, what's another week, I'll wait.

At the end of the week, my blanket had still not shipped. I contacted them again and asked when it would be shipped. By this point I was getting a little irritated. I was told my blanket was made, but they would give it a ""final cleaning"" on Monday, and ship it out on Tuesday. At this point, I'm starting to get concerned about whether my blanket will actually be shipped, or if my blanket even exists. I paid for my blanket via PayPal, and Paypal has a 45 day limit to opening a dispute. I decided that if my blanket was not shipped by Tuesday (40 days), I would open a dispute to protect myself in the event the blanket never got shipped.

Tuesday came and went, and my blanket had still not shipped. I opened a Paypal dispute (if you're not familiar with disputes, it's basically a monitored line of communication that is supposed to be used to settle a concern) stating I needed my blanket shipped as soon as possible. 

Wednesday, I checked and found I had a full refund, and the message from the seller said that I had requested the order be cancelled and I get refunded. That is absolutely not true - I NEVER requested a refund. All I wanted was my blanket. If I didn't want the blanket, I wouldn't have ordered it in the first place. Since the money was refunded, the Paypal dispute was permanently closed. 

The message left for me in Paypal said to call them if I wanted to order the blanket again. I attempted to call with IP-Relay (voice calls are exceedingly difficult for me), but got no answer. So I emailed instead and told them that I did in fact want my blanket, and I did not request the refund. The reply said they automatically refund the money if that's what the customer wanted. THAT IS NOT WHAT I WANTED. She said I could pay the money again, and she'd send out the blanket. Guess what? The refund of course hasn't been processed yet, and is sitting in limbo somewhere between Paypal and my bank. I don't have an extra $260 laying around, so I can't pay for the blanket until my refund is processed. That means it will be AT LEAST another week, if not two, before I can pay. Which delays my blanket even more. 

This company seems to take pleasure in causing distress to people on the spectrum. Either that, or they know they can take advantage of us more easily. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. It has been the worst customer service experience of my life, and I still don't even have a weighted blanket to show for it. 

To top if off, the company censors posts to their page by customers, and does not allow Facebook reviews. This means everything you see on their page is going to be positive, because they block the negative from showing up. I have a page for my hobby-business, and I NEVER censor it. I find it incredibly shady that they treat their page and their customers this way. Prior to ordering my blanket, I had only heard good things about this company - and now I know why. I hope that this revew helps at least one other person. I don't want anyone to have to go through this same ordeal with nothing to show for it. 

I still don't have the weighted blanket I desperately need, and I don't know where to turn to find one. It will take a couple weeks before I can ever order one if I do find a place, since my money is not cleared yet.

TL;DR: Dreamcatcher Weighted Blankets is a scam of a company that tries to hide any negative comments from its customers and takes advantage of people with disabilities.

Please upvote for visibility. I intentionally posted this is a text post and not a link because it means I get no karma from it. I only want others considering a Dreamcatcher blanket to see this.

236,Brother's self talk really needs to be controlled; no idea what to do,"edit2: controlled was the wrong word, mitigated would be better.  I don't think my parents and I know that myself don't see ending self-talk as a possibility.  Volume control is more what I'm looking for.

I'm 22, brother's 20.  He'd be classified as moderately autistic.  I'm living at home at the moment.  I'm not sure if it's because I was away from home that the self talk gets me now or if it is actually worse as my mother claims. 

edit: regarding the moderate deal, it was pretty simple to get $1,000/month in disability from the government other than some bureaucratic issues.  But he got approved of for the money quickly and easily by everyone who did evaluations.  Not sure what that says really, but maybe it helps.  

But it really is detrimental to the family.  I can hear him a house or two down when I'm walking down the block.  It makes me feel like I'm living in the Radley house from To Kill a Mockingbird.  It's constant.  Frankly, it's the most common sound in the house.  It dominates the entire house, which is a relatively large two story.  It's constant, never ending.  Often, it has a very high pitch and is extremely grating.  It's usually the same stuff from video games and comics again and again and again, like ""I'll show you"" from Micky's Speedway (N64).  But it happens all the time, when he's out walking, when he's sitting at the dinner table, etc.

Now, I have real fears for this for his future.  My parents have kicked the can down the road for a year now, but we need to find a living situation for my brother.  But I feel like his self talk is to the point where we cannot put him in an apartment because it would be totally unfair to his neighbors.  Especially his downstairs neighbor; he jumps quite a bit.  That's a really big deal for us since we live in the Bay Area and housing isn't exactly cheap.  In theory my brother could stay at home, but after 17+ years of taking care of an autistic son, my parents are burned out and they're too old for it (66/62).  Realistically, they only have a couple years left in them.  My parents would like to travel a bit in their retirement, so they wouldn't be home as much, but they'd stay if they had to.  And they're just older at this point.  I'm not sure how they could physically deal with living with and taking care of my brother every day in 4-5 years.  

Sometimes, we will try to correct the self talk by taking away the video game (which is huuuuuuge for my brother), but after 17+ years, we're all tired of being the heavy in a struggle that's endless and has seen nowhere near the progress that we've all hoped for.  Besides, I don't think negative reinforcement does much good, so it's very uncommon.

But, we'd done that for years and it (obviously) hasn't helped much, so it's obviously not the solution.

Anyways, any help would be appreciated.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1puyca/brothers_self_talk_really_needs_to_be_controlled/,59

Very soon special-ed teachers and parents were asking us if we could do versions that would work better for their kids.  We want to contribute to thit community in any way possible.

At this time are trying to qualify for a grant that would allow us to launch development of variants of our existing iOS app with the aim of creating a better fit and delivering the necessary value for the education of children with special needs.

The grant contest is run by Chase Bank.  We need to reach 250 votes before November 15th. in order to qualify.  We already have over 180 votes.  We could really use your help now to reach our goal.

I'm okay with her diagnosis, that's life and it doesn't change the fact that I love her and I will try my best to help her reach her potential.

But parents of other kids with Autism sometimes infuriate me, and I don't know how to handle it in a graceful way. Especially in this support group I'm a part of. 

My daughter's doctors all suggested I join a local group for parents of Autistic children for support. But I find myself feeling worse at these events. I know that everybody there has challenges and that I shouldn't compare struggles, but I get SO SO ANGRY with these parents There are like 12 other adults in this group. All have kids with a PDD-NOS or Asperger's diagnosis. All fairly high-functioning kids. Except for mine. 

I find myself thinking pretty rude thoughts about them the entire time I'm there. Their children are all functioning on a considerably higher level than mine does (and likely ever will.) In their attempt to include me, they will try and say things like ""oh, I understand"" when I talk about my daughter's life. But the thing is, they really don't understand. I know they are trying to be kind, but it INFURIATES me when they say that. 

I don't feel like my participation in this group is helpful for me, and I'm worried that if I stick around too long that I will lose my cool and say something hurtful. 

This entire post is going to make me sound like an asshole, I know. But I came here thinking MAYBE somebody would get where I'm coming from and give me advice. I want to know if there is any merit to me staying in a group like this? If so, how can I be gracious towards these other parents and not be rude?

I've been a lurker for some time, however at the behest of my girlfriend I seek your wisdom and assistance.

In an attempt to avoid hitting you with a dreaded wall of incomprehensible gibberish, I'll attempt to keep this as direct and minimalist as possible.

I have a form of high-functioning autism which lands a bit deeper in the spectrum.  It has been both a welcome augment to my life, as well as a troublesome bane.  Saying I'm socially inept and uncomfortable is an understatement, however I've managed to deal with it in acceptable ways; much situational avoidance is often necessitated.  Approximately 3 years ago I met someone who I'm quite keen of, and I have strong feelings for at times, however I find myself in great duress when dealing with relationship issues.  I seem to view all upsets and problems involving me as my failures, and subsequently I tend to get distraught by guilt and a distinct emotion of having done something terribly wrong.  I will listen to my significant other express her concerns, but I tend to shut down, exasperating the issue.  She has a need to vent, and after approximately an hour or so, it becomes so overwhelming that I completely break down crying and become self-injurious in what seems to be almost an autonomic response.  The method of which usually doesn't change, but it primarily consists of hitting my head (and oddly, my quads), and it can often be rather traumatic and damaging.  Last week I broke the skin on several places on my head and left more than a few bruises.  Self injury aside, I am extraordinarily innocuous and non-violent, and I don't have any sort of anger issues or temperament.  This was a trait about myself that I was quite unaware of up until a few years ago, primarily due to the fact that I'd never been in any sort of emotional relationship before.

I've sought professional help with the assistance of my girlfriend, but nobody was equipped to handle someone in my situation.  Although these instances seem to be somewhat rare, I do wish to do whatever possible to put an immediate cessation to them.

This morning, I had him sitting on the edge of the bed and I wanted him to express to me that he wanted to get down. I kept asking him to tell me, ""Mommy, down?"" and he wouldn't budge. He cried a little (my face was serious and I think he thinks he was in trouble) but didn't say anything. I eventually just asked him to say ""mama"" but still nothing. He just looked at me. 

So I kinda lost it. I am so ashamed to say I yelled in fustration and asked him ""WHY CAN'T YOU BE NORMAL?!""

Of course he started crying which made me cry and lose it more. I grabbed him by the shoulders (not hard) and put him to sit on the couch, but he was scared. The fear I saw in his little face...I can't get it out of my head.

I don't want to see that look EVER again. EVER.

People seem to think that I am trying to demonstrate my vocabulary because it is so hard for me to find the words to say what I want to tell them. It never feels correct. Talking about anything but myself is not the same. Long winded and forced often, uncomfortable when I can't seem to stop even whenI can see that  the listener wants to run, but not painful. 

Now I have a new Doctor and therapist. I know that something else is going on with me and always has. Now I realize that I have to find another way to negotiate this world because what I have come up with is miserable. I have isolated myself for a very long time, outside of going to work I have been alone. Working two low pay jobs just to survive. Free time spent on endless netflix, Internet, reading, or collecting crap to prepare to change, info, art supplies, books. Piling up until they immobilize my ability to do anything. Because I have to use it. Then I give it away or throw it out. And start all over again, buried mentally in ""planning"" yet never ""doing""

262,Question: What's the hardest part about raising a child with autism?,"Hello everyone,
 
I'm a college student in a Design for America studio at UC Berkeley. A few years ago, a DFA studio at University of Oregon worked on [Melo Sense](http://designforamerica.com/projects/melo-sense/), which was designed to encourage social interaction and creative communication in autistic children.
 
This year, the members in the Berkeley studio have been looking to address issues in autism from a different angle, and we found that there is very little research on what challenges that parents of autistic children face. I was hoping we could get some answers from r/autism.
 
Some of the questions we've been thinking over are:
 
* What part of the day is most stressful for you? Why?

* Our research thus far indicates that structure is important in scheduling activities for autistic children. Is this so, and what effects does it have on daily life?

* What activities do you do most with your autistic child?

* Do you stay at home, and if so, do you homeschool your autistic child?

* Do you hire a nanny? If so, why? About how much do you spend on a nanny annually?
 
I understand that these may not be questions that you wish to answer in a public forum. If you are more comfortable answering questions in private, please message me.
 
Also, we were wondering if we could interview a parent with an autistic child/autistic children. Please message me if you are willing to Skype, call us, or email-- it would help us generate more insights into autism and identify issues we can help address.
 
Thank you for your time. Any information is greatly appreciated.

EDIT: Thanks for your responses! I'll run them by the team. Those of you who offered interviews will hear from us shortly. If you have anything else you want to share, keep it coming :)",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1oy7vq/question_whats_the_hardest_part_about_raising_a/,210

I am new to this sub, but think it is a good place to ask this question. Can anyone give any insight into why teachers don't have access to technologies for lower functioning autistic students? I know there was a debacle with a school system in Texas over the last couple of years using RFID trackers to keep track of all students, but that was just to improve the amount of funding the school received each year. I have never worked in education, but have a strong feeling it is impossible to keep track of students at all times. Teachers have to give attention to each individual and during that time lose track of another student. If you are an educator, what are the reasons you wouldn't want to adopt a helpful location tracking system, cost, ease of use? If you are a student or a parent of a student are there privacy concerns? What would need to be done to allay those concerns?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1onhu2/new_to_this_sub_since_avonte_i_have_been/,59
273,Followup: Helping my daughter to sleep,"Hi

Firstly thank you to this group for all the helpful suggestions.  You guys rock.

I am delighted to report that my daughter is now sleeping much better.  While we always had a regular bed time routine, we have now supplemented it with a visual schedule.  Sometimes, we pre-empt the routine with some time under a (home-made) weighted blanket.  The routine also includes playing SleepPhones ""A minor thing"" [free download](http://www.sleepphones.com/mp3/free-mp3-downloads) on a loop on her CD player.  None of this cracked it, though, so we also include a very small amount of melatonin now, and she drifts happily off to sleep within about 30 minutes.

274,"Nearly 3y/o I babysit for has just been diagnosed, what should I do to help him and his family?","I am there at least 3 afternoons a week so I would consider myself quite a big part of his life. They are going for a second opinion as he is borderline and since it's a subjective test they just want to make sure before they label him as anything, although they are obviously investigating OTs etc in the mean time. 

His main autistic traits are his obsession with cars; lining toys up and getting really upset if anyone touches his formations; being a rubbish sleeper (refusing naps, early wake ups) despite clearly being exhausted; requiring lots of warning before activities end and the new one begins; and big screaming tantrums (2-3 times a week, depending on how much sleep he gets).

However, he's got great language skills (but falls short on communicating emotions sometimes, although he is only little); tells me and his family he loves us spontaneously and will occasionally grant spontaneous hugs; is very good at sharing other toys with his brother when he doesn't want his brother to touch the ones he is playing with. 

Sorry, I'm not sure what is relevant but I guess that's a bit of an overview? We're in Australia so Australian answers would be extra appreciated to do with government supports and schools and all that but I would love any general tips or anything you guys would like to share with me!

277,"People with autism whose support group/safety net disappeared and had to fend for themselves, how do you survive? I need help.","I have Williams syndrome, diagnosed at 11 and for the most part, was kept in a bubble.  The only person who advocated my care was my Dad.  He passed away in 2009 and no one else was available to help me with the little things.  I moved from a rural Southern state to Los Angeles due to the public transit system's access to all the necessary resources that I'd need, but I seem to be lost in seeking the proper advocacy services.  I have signed up to L.A. Care to help me get Medicare/MediCAL so my physicals are covered by the doctor, but they do not help cover my glasses, contact lens (need them both to see), and hearing aids.  In addition to my mental disability I am also legally blind and hard of hearing.  Thanks to Medicare, I can use the local metro services for a flat rate of $14 a month so I don't have to wait on someone with a car to take me where I need to go.

But when it comes to other aspects of my life I am lost.  I am on a fixed income so I can't afford to live alone.  I post on craigslist to find normal, stable people who just wants someone to reliably pay them rent each month and instead I meet people who don't want a handicapped person living with them despite my guaranteed monthly income.  I am going through vocational rehabilitation to try to find a job and have gotten absolutely no job referrals, only submitting applications to help me get new glasses and hearing aids only to be told that ""I am still in the process of submitting your application for approval and will let you know when I hear back"" for the past three months.  I am currently living with a couple of roommates who probably were also rejected for sharing a living space with clean, organized, predictable people with a routine because they both have very unorthodox lifestyles with shady friends and as a result have had some of my stuff stolen.  Which is exactly what I have been trying to avoid all along.  I only moved in with them because 1. I wanted to get out of an even worse living situation and 2. they were the ONLY people to have met me and said it was okay for me to live with them.  Have not heard back from anyone else that I met for screening and vetting purposes.

I know there are dangerous people out there, I've been told this on a daily basis by my dad when he was alive.  But I can not afford to wait on a job opening or ""things to get better"" and risk suffering a setback as a result of these peoples' lifestyles.  I really need a local advocate service or something similar that won't be impatient and work with me to help me get in a more stable environment.  I have tried to google, both signed in AND out (search results are different depending on this, apparently), for this information but all I'm seeing are a lot of sites aimed towards parents with children on the spectrum.  I thought pages like [this](http://www.autism-society.org/living-with-autism/lifespan/adulthood/residentialhousing.html) would be relevant but I really need a direct contact number to speak with a human being so we can work together to find someplace affordable on my budget where I can get some peace and quiet when I sleep in the dark and wake up knowing my belongings will still be intact in their proper place.

I had a meeting at the school because my son attacked another teacher and bit her in the arm. During the meeting another teacher said that he is afraid of and is intimated by my son. He said this in front of the school psychologist, other staff and two vice principles. 

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I understand the teacher's view. I'm a teacher myself and I've had troubling students. Not to the degree of my son but the job itself deals with working with parents. I would never say anything like that to a parent. No matter what the issue was.  What was a meeting that was supposed to be on how to help my son quickly turned into gang up on the mom and say all the bad things we can say.

Edited to add a thank you to all for the comments. My son's behavior in no way should be tolerated by any one. My last wish is for any one to be hurt obviously. He is a low functioning autistic with very little means for communication. What my hope was for my son was  to have an education by those that knew how. And if and his current behavior proved to be too challenging, try and figure out a away to help him. All that his teachers said to me was that they don't know what to do.

He has a very, very hard time with impulse control and is in a classroom with only 2 children.  He has neighborhood friends (a few) as well. So pretty social.  He connects primarily through his expertise with computers and gaming.  He is excellent at both and I am very proud of his programming skill.   So computers are pretty important to him, to say the least.

 He recently learned to ride his bike because he wanted to keep up with the other neighborhood children that he knows through gaming.  That is the only other activity he does.

However, I have noticed that he gets grumpy (understatement) when he is focused on screens too much.  We worked out a system where I suggest that he take a break (every hour or so) and he will go ride his bike for a few minutes, etc.  But it's not enough.

 He and my other child are spending entirely too much time on screens. I am basing this on their behavior - not some ""ideal"" screen time formula.

I also enjoy computers, etc and do a lot of creative work with them. So I am also big into screen time.   I don't have a knee jerk reaction against screen time. My concern is based on their responses. I am more concerned about my Asperger's son because my other child has sports and other activities and ends up doing less screen time as a result.

We have also tried doing one hour a day, etc.  What ends up happening is he is so anxious about that time, it's all he thinks about. 

We did a screen break for a week this summer and it went well.

I don't think it is reasonable given our interests and for educational purposes, etc to stop screen time all together.   But I need some suggestions of a way to structure it so that it is not the focus all the time.

Also - he earns up to an hour of computer time for the end of the school day as a part of the reward system in his class.  He usually plays Minecraft then. So even if we don't have it at home, he gets it at school.

Any suggestions?

Edit to add: He has severe social anxiety. We don't do much of anything that has more than a couple of people in attendance unless he is feeling much more centered than usual.

In the past I had to deal with physical tics in the face area.
As time went by however I dealt with these tics, they came and passed every few months.

I've hadn't had them for a long time now, but they're back yet again, this time vocally.
I am forced to make a sound by inhaling in a.. non natural way.
It's embarrassing in public and in school.
Everyone around me is aware of my autism but it's still embarrassing and my mom sometimes gets kind of annoyed by it
(she understands my autism but it's difficult for her I guess..)

I'm thinking about getting Pimozide or Risperidon.
These are supposedly medicines that calm you down and lower tic rate, at the moment I feel very stressed (even though I have nothing to worry or stress about) and this makes the tics even worse.

Tell me /autism/ how do you deal with your relatives Autism tics, or maybe your own.
Or do you know any ways to calm down?
Have any of you had any of these medicines before and can you tell me whether they work or not?

I'm diagnosed with a slight case of PDD-NOS. Not terribly intrusive, but still enough to warrant the diagnosis. The main problem I keep running into is the fact that I can't start on my schoolwork. I'm 24, in my sixth year of university and for some reason I can't stay focused on my schoolwork. I have an essay due in 5 days, and while I know I can easily finish it in half a day, I feel more and more stressed out about starting to write it. I already know what I'm going to write about, I have the basic structure of my essay, I just need to type it down. Yet, I can't find the discipline to actually get started (and once I do, I'm incredibly easily distracted). Do you know a way of keeping me disciplined? Schedules (as in, work for an hour, do something else for half an hour) don't work, I just won't keep myself to it.  
It might also be a case of atychiphobia, but I know more people with that, and my way of dealing with stress is to avoid it altogether, rather than stressing out about what might be halfway through.  
It's infuriating, I know I can finish it in a few hours (it's only 1500 words, no big deal, actually), but it's so daunting to leap the first hurdle, and that tires me out. Constantly trying to gather my courage, then falter at the last moment, only to try again half an hour later.

If I had other children, I might compare him to the other children, and not view him as I do now. My husband and I have decided not to have anymore biological children, but hope to adopt a child in the future that has autism. So the knowledge we have learned can benefit another child that may be consider challenging to others.  



Having a child with special needs is very hard, and so challenging. But I try to remind myself that I'm not the one with autism, and I don't have to live it every minute of the day. I love reading and hearing from the perspective of other autistics, more so than so called experts. The true experts are those who live it. I read ""the reason I jump"" recently and it was very eye opening. I suggest other read it as well.

294,Need help understanding the best way to handle the way my 5 year old son freaks out because my 3 year old daughter says the wrong thing.,"Before I explain the details, I just want to be straightforward. I am specifically looking for the following: 

-Insight on the way he might be thinking. I want to understand his logic and how his brain works so that I can correctly direct him and help him understand. 

-Advice on helpful words or phrases.

-How to help him calm down. 

Here is what is going on. My 5 year old son is very black and white. Everything is the way it is and it can't be anyway else. Mix that with a defiant 3 year old little sister and the results are horrible. 

Example 1: She is trying to get into the car and can't pull the handle hard enough. She cries ""the door is locked"". However, Nate knows the door isn't locked. He tells her ""the door isn't locked"" and she screams back ""yes it is!!"" this goes back and forth, he gets angrier and angrier and then hurts her because he HAS to correct her.

Example 2: We are driving to Daddy's work and then going to Granny's house. My daughter only focuses on the fact that we're going to Granny's and keeps saying that. But Nate knows that we're going to Daddy's work THEN Granny's house. And he yells that her. She yells no we're going to Granny's....it goes back and forth until Nate gets so pissed he hurts her. 

Today he was freaking out because he was trying to hug her and she was saying ""that's gross"" for no real reason just because she's freaking 3. He repeats over and over that hugs aren't gross and gets mad that she won't agree with him. He asks me if they are, I tell him no they're not. I try to tell my daughter they're not so she stops pissing him off. It doesn't work of course because she's so dang stubborn. I try so hard to redirect him, to tell him to walk away, to hit something soft if he's mad, that it's ok to be mad, but not ok to hurt. He keeps trying to hug her over and over with the same result until he screams like a freaking demon ""HUGS ARE NOT GROSS"" and BITES her. Right in front of me. When he gets mad enough he does not care who is watching, he HAS to correct her. He cannot let it go. 

I don't expect him to think like me, but I just cannot figure out what to say to help him understand that she is 3, and to just let her be wrong because she doesn't understand. I don't know how to prevent him from hurting her. I understand that he is literal, that things are black and white in his mind, but need help thinking of things to say to help him control his anger and to not hurt. I'm not trying to change him, I love him and everything about him. Maybe just some ideas on how to redirect him. Though he is on the spectrum, he does care very much about other people's feelings and is very empathetic which I know is not a normal autistic trait. But I have been told by several therapists that the fact that he is so literal and black and white puts him on the spectrum. I would love any input.

298,"A case for spirit mediumship and reiki as a therapeutic method for improving the empathy of autistics, my evidence and research-Wall of Text","This is a serious thread. If you're not interested, then don't respond. It's really long, but I gloss over things I could write a book on. If you're going to call me a scammer or a profiteer, know that part of this post will be devoted to solitary attunement and spirit worship. It costs nothing. It's free. And I believe it is the best therapeutic option for autistic spectrum disorders. I know because I am autistic myself.

I study this as a pass time now. I have a diagnosis of aspergers. You might have seen a film called 'The Horse Boy'? It's about a child with autism whose family flies to Mongolia to get healed by shamans. That's close to the region of shamanism that *I study*. 

In 2004, I had a profound mystical experience. I already had a diagnosis of aspergers, by this point. I met young girls in college who were attuned reiki mediums, and it interested me. When I found out about the cost, which was over $250 for attunement at level 1, I considered doing it anyway and burning $200 on this if it didn't work but I reconsidered. So what I did instead was something quite radical. I attempted to initiate -by myself.

**Don't do this**. 

I was a fan of Japanese anime. I started seeing it in the late 90s and early 2000s. So, I knew what Shinto was, in the sense that I had more than a passing knowledge of it. I knew that reiki must have been related to Shinto. Here is an online article from jstore to do with [esoteric Buddhism, Shinto, and the Reikiki](http://www.jstor.org/stable/30233724). You don't have to read this and I will try to explain everything. It's just there as one of my links on recommended scholarship to read. Before you fight and argue with me, will you go over my references? I can anticipate the ugly responses this will get already and the fact is I probably know more about the subject than you do. So in any case, I didn't end up getting reiki attunement, so what did I do instead?

In 2004, it was summer time, and I was going to Fantasia Film Festival. They're a prestigious genre film festival. One of the films showing was called Save The Green Planet!, and it was largely responsible for spurning me into trying to initiate by myself. I will repeat myself again -avoid doing this. [Here is a trailer for the film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H-hPpPMu4A). In the trailer, a young boy kidnaps the ceo of a chemicals company because he believes him to be an alien from Andromeda galaxy. He wants to torture him until he gets 'the truth'. As a precaution, he shaves off the guy's head -fearing that the alien will be able to communicate through his hair. Film is a comedy, horror, scifi, tragedy, melodrama. Now, my post is going to get even weirder, and more entertaining. I promise. This is all leading into something. Something cosmically epic. With sensational and absurd turns of events. 

When I was a young kid, it was the mid 1990s, and Whitley Strieber was a popular author. He wrote The Hunger -made into a film starring David Bowie-, and a book called Communion. Strieber believed that the U.S. government had made contact with alien forces, and was using him to disseminate these facts to the masses. Curiously, Strieber didn't believe that these aliens were from outer-space, and he just called them 'the visitors'. You probably know this already, if you've ever read this guy's book, or seen the film with Christopher Walken? But, I'll just go right out and say it to be clear.. aliens are fucking scary, and his books were actually really good. They deserved all the accolades they got as works of supernatural horror fiction. Especially in this time period I read the book in.. early to mid 1990s, and didn't have the internet didn't have snopes and so on. The weirdest thing about this book was, it was fucking scary, yes, but.. there's more.. the title was very ambiguous, and spiritual. So too was the nature of what the visitors *were*. His books gave me the creeps. I recommend them. This is all spinning in the back of my mind as I go into the theatre to see this obscure Korean movie. There is more to this film than meets the eye. Here's a great essay on Whitley Strieber's work called the [Perils Of The Literary Shaman](http://www.dailygrail.com/stream/2008/3/Carlos-Castaneda-Whitley-Strieber-and-Perils-Literary-Shaman) (here we go). It wasn't just this book with his alien head on the cover, the same alien head (Strieber's) was also used in the X Files TV show, and Unsolved Mysteries, for the aliens in those shows. There is evidence that it was a form of social engineering. It gets weirder, I promise.

And I promise this is a post on shamanism, and I am getting to it. But the korean film is weird, life is weird, the time was weird, and I needed to explain that stuff, link to articles, and so on..

I'm skipping ahead a bit, but in University I discovered a theologian named Rudolf Otto. He is famous for writing a book called [The Idea of the Holy](http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/gothic/numinous.html). You can download the book online easily since it is now public archive. He theorized that (this is a mouthful, but I should say it in this way..) *intimations of the numinous instil in human beings an emotional experience that he called daemonic-dread. This emotion is sui generis - in a class by itself . It -results- in the sensation of hair standing on end, and energy cascading along the body felt as the shivers, shudders, or the creeps and so on. He called this experience mysterium tremendum et fascinoscum. Jeffrey J. Kripal, in his book Authors Of The Impossible: The Paranormal And The Sacred, described it as such - *[A] particular structure of human consciousness that corresponds to a palpable presence, energy, or power encountered in the environment. Otto captured this sacred sixth sense, at once subject and object, in a famous Latin sound bite: the sacred is the mysterium tremendum et fascinas, that is, the mystical (mysterium) as both fucking scary (tremendum) and utterly fascinating (fascinas).* Rudolf Otto wrote that *""These two qualities, the daunting and the fascinating, now combine in a strange harmony of contrasts, and the resultant dual character of the numinous consciousness, to which the entire religious development bears witness, at any rate from the level of the daemonic dread onwards, is at once the strangest and most noteworthy phenomenon in the whole history of religion. The daemonic-divine (sic) object may appear to the mind an object of horror and dread, but at the same time it is no less something that allures with a potent charm, and the creature, who trembles before it, utterly cowed and cast down, has always at the same time the impulse to turn to it, nay even to make it somehow his own.""* . In plainer language, ghosts and aliens are spooky, we shiver and shudder and feel the creeps, but those sensations curiously enough are only felt for those aliens, ghosts, and so on. Are aliens ghosts? ... It's a unique experience, in a class by itself. It cannot be reduced, or attributed to anything else. And Rudolf Otto believed that that experience was at the core of religion. It was [Jacob's Ladder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJztRnDxdM8). To commune with the undead in that way, leads to God. I recommend the Japanese anime [Mushi-Shi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcoZHk3M3io) , because it mixes this experience of daemonic-dread with spirit communion. Alright. So that is an overview of Rudolf Otto's philosophy. Who Whitley Strieber was. And it relates to the Save The Green Planet! film, and more. If you've watched the trailer, you might have noticed that there is more going on in this film than just aliens. There is also spirit visitation by his dead mother. 

This is what this thread is ultimately about. **I didn't know this yet, but the film has as undercurrent to it *of* korean shamanism**. His cottage is high on a mountain top, where the gods live. This is a cultural episteme in Korea, a symbol that Koreans would understand. 

When I saw this film, I had read Strieber, and had wanted to initiate into Shinto, through a rite of attunement, by myself. It worked, through releasing shudders from daemonic-dread, and I had a acute manic psychosis. 

I promise you, what I have to say now, gets weirder. 

Years later, in school, I have a mind to start studying Shinto and Korean Shamanism. This is what I found. I will share two images.

[Image #1](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v150/danielg1414/IMG_0918.jpg) 

[Image #2](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v150/danielg1414/IMG_0794.jpg)

I was aghast. This is the same kind of psychosis, that I had. And from Shinto as well, no less. And this Korean film. Everything starts coming together. 

So I start pulling out books on shamanism, one after another. It has resulted in a suggested reading list that looks something like this. 

SHAMANISM IN KOREAN CHRISTIANITY
 by Jang Nam Hyuck

In S.Korea, the infilling of the holy spirit is understood as ki. 

KOREAN SHAMANISM: THE CULTURAL PARADOX
by Chongho Kim

Makes the case for S.Korean shamanism as 'The Field Of Misfortune'. Spirits are called through an emotional experience that Rudolf Otto called Daemonic-Dread. (I'm going over this with a fine tooth comb, and it will get better and better as I write, and make sense, I promise, whether or not you agree). Here's a quote from the book. *-A Haunted Feeling- Soh Bosal started the kut ritual with a drum, sitting together with Oki's Mother on the mat. It was a very cold and windy night even though it was spring. Everything seemed to be frozen in the spring cold. It was so cold that I came back to the car for a rest while Soh Bosal performed the first phase of the kut. I was not keen to observe the first phase, because it just consisted of routine procedures. I took a cigarette out of my pocket and put it in my mouth. Suddenly I felt a strong haunted feeling in the air around me. It felt as if a ghost was going to jump in front of the windscreen. I was so scared that I felt goose bumps appearing on my skin, and a shiver ran down my spine. I turned on the car's interior light and looked in the rear vision mirror, because it felt as though a ghost was about to enter the car through the rear windscreen and squeeze my neck from the back seat. I locked all of the doors. But still the spooky feeling did not go away. So I switched on the radio and turned up the sound ... I began to talk to myself ... [What] is the reason I was possessed by a haunted feeling just now? ... What did Mirim's Mother say to you? She said, ""I do not like to see kut rituals, where there seem to be lots of ghosts around. I feel as if worms are going around my body."" Yes! The haunted feeling ... Chisun's Grandmother said to me, ""... The waves of life made me know this way.""*

KUT: HAPPINESS THROUGH RECIPROCITY 
by Hyun-key Kim Hogarth

Underpinning Korean society is this idea of reciprocity . The way a shaman initiates is through offering their ki energy to the spirits, and they reciprocate empowered channeled energy back into the neophyte. [This is also known as the Maussian principle of reciprocity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAKBcs94ATw). 

KOREAN SHAMANISM -MUISM
 by Dr. Kim Tae-kon &amp; Dr. Chang Soo-kyung

This is the book that an image scan was from. I have more works cited on [my blog](http://trollovgrimness.blogspot.ca/). 

If you want to initiate by yourself, and spend no money, that is the way to do it. If you want to pay for reiki attunement, you can use google and easily find some. 

But this is the way I have found how to deal - by becoming an empath.

300,"Post-high school education and people with ""severe"" autism.","For the past two years, my parents and I had much discussion about my educational, living, and financial plans for college (I'm going to graduate high school on May 2014). These discussions would occur usually during meals or in the car. Because of these frequent discussions, my autistic sister began to diligently listen to these conversations. This is likely to pose a problem because my sister will start to be much more anxious about getting into college when she isn't even self-aware about her autism and learning disorder. Not going to college would've emotionally affect her as she will start to be jealous of my studying in college.

As a brother, I want my sister to have the same life experiences that I have, especially with college - Unfortunately, because of my sister's autism and learning disorder, she won't be guaranteed to live independently in today's society (although, I'm willing to to challenge this statement).

302,My four-year-old boy started to exhibit signs of the spectrum. Seeking advice from other parents.,"My son was born normal height and weight by c-section. He had Plagiocephaly and torticolis, which we fixed via stretching, physical therapy, and corrective helmets. He also has hypotonia (low muscle tone), which required therapy.  Hypotonia comes from a duplication in a specific gene, which by itself hasn't been tied to anything specific in all scientific literature our doctors were able to research.  I, the father, also have it and I appear to not exhibit muscle issues or spectrum markers. 

He was and is mostly a nice, happy little 4 year old boy. He sleeps well, eats pretty well, stays active, although gets tired rather easily. His favorite toys are hex bugs, push button toys, and anything with a screen. He loves to jump on trampolines and would literally knock himself out jumping if not stopped. He is a great swimmer, and loves doing pull-ups with me every morning.  He understands Russian and English, loves to count and add, knows all letters, started to put them into words, and is obsessed with number 88.  He recently learned Twinkle Twinkle on the piano.  He is potty trained except during bedtime.  He remembers and can recite several books. 

He is a hand flapper since a very young age. We limited activities that got him overexcited (falling marbles, toys that hide behind or under other toys and then emerge suddenly, arcade games), so we don't see him flap non-stop. For example, he can easily sit still at his desk and do learning activities on the iPad and not flap once, but then the cat drags in the robotic bug and he goes nuts.

We recently noticed that we can no longer write off his anti-social behavior as ""being shy"" because other parents, normally reserved, started to notice and say something like ""why isn't he responding?"".  He isolates himself on playgrounds, sandboxes, and at home, and doesn't seem to know how to approach or respond to other kids.  He recently whipped a bunch of wood chips at another kid without any sign of understanding or empathy. 

He recently stopped answering direct questions, follow directions, respond to his name.  He started to say nonsensical words and phrases, and respond and react with phrases he's heard before, without constructing his own. He doesn't know how to respond to general questions like ""what did you do today?"" and ""what's your favorite food to eat?""  He toewalks a lot, and runs without engaging his quads with a kind of a funky skip-gallop.  He can still catch a ball, but he's pretty uncoordinated. He can't balance on one foot or dress himself.

Our doctors are not giving us any kind of an answer because he seems to be scoring just barely enough to not be on the spectrum while exhibiting many signs of autism. I'm hanging in there, but my wife is beside herself.

This entire semester, I will be partnered in a college communication class with a young woman who has a form of high-functioning autism. I forget her specific diagnoses, but she very openly told me that it's a form of autism. So far, she is struggling a lot with the course. The professor often becomes frustrated with her. She is often saying that she is doing very badly in the course, but she wants to take it because she wants to improve her communication skills. 

Unfortunately, this is not a communication skills course; it is a communication THEORY course. As a result, she is struggling a lot to understand the material (she believes that the analysis of social behavior just doesn't ""click"" with her). She also says she often forgets things, and does not like to continue tasks that she finds difficult or unpleasant (i.e., research). 

As I mentioned, the professor is easily frustrated by her. She complains a lot, and often repeats herself loudly and interrupts other students/the professor. 

Soon we will be beginning a long-term research project within our assigned partnerships. She gets very upset about choosing research topics, and often refuses ideas she doesn't like. She doesn't like the library. She likes me, but I'm very nervous about working together.

For some background, I've been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder since I was a child. I've also been diagnosed with social anxiety.

 I used to get really frustrated with touch and sound. I still do, but as a child, I would throw tantrums whenever things got too chaotic. I get stressed out easily whenever a lot of things are happening around me, eg: a party. I hate being touched because It feels like the sensation lingers for a long time. Loud noises are just as bad, especially chewing noises or people yelling. I have trouble talking with people. I feel like I have to put up a facade whenever I socialize, which is really off putting and tiring at times. It's really frustrating because I don't really show my emotions, but there are times where it's necessary to.

I used to [and still do] have a habit of shaking objects - it's as if I have this energy I need to get out of my system and the way I do that is by exerting it onto something else. I also am prone to bouncing on the balls of my feet, and doing other repetitious movements, for long periods of time.

I still take longer to learn fine motor skill-related tasks than other people. I am also prone to obsessions and routines/rituals.

As I said before, I'm not the most social person. In fact, I sometimes get really anxious about social situations and dread certain conversational topics - usually light, casual ones and small-talk-y stuff. But I'm not antisocial either - I went out a lot in college. But it seems that whenever I meet people for the first time - this is what I've heard from others - I don't always make a great impression because I can be either too intense or too distant, depending on my mood that day.

As a child, my dad suggested to my mom that I get tested for autism but she dismissed it. However, I've been wondering if I really should be tested. I took an AQ test online and I got a score of 39. I know an online test is not a formal diagnosis, but it got me wondering whether me having autism is a reality. Should I get formally tested for autism? 

tl;dr I think I'm autistic since I display some trademark signs of autism so should I get tested for it?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1nf28t/i_think_i_may_be_autistic_but_i_have_never_been/,242
308,X-Post from r/parenting *with more questions at the end* Best way to discuss inappropriate touching with 13 year old with autism?,"We are unsure of what to do. My 13 year old brother-in-law has been grabbing women's breasts (teachers, family, anyone really). He knows it's wrong, and will say ""Oh I'm sorry"", then keep doing it :/
We obviously need to have another talk with him and put an end to this immediately, but we are unsure of the best way to approach it. His victims, parents, and teachers have told him to stop (with it not working), but nobody is really giving us (the family) any sort of technique or method to utilize (if one even exists?). His teachers haven't been communicating much either, just a phone call telling what he does at school. The parent-teacher relationship is basically non-existent due to school policy within the special needs program (parents aren't allowed to come in ever, communication doesn't happen, etc.). I haven't had any experience with programs in other school districts, but is this common? Any advice appreciated


**Based on some responses from the /r/parenting post, some addition questions of mine**

What would be the best way to find an ABA therapist/similar that would be able to address his specific needs the best?

Is there any sort of other recommended therapies/tests/whatever that we should be trying to find and utilize outside of the public school district?

What can we do about his education? I mentioned in the other post that they won't allow parental interaction and a transfer to another district is impossible unless they move. The policies of the district always seemed off to me, and some other users confirmed how strange (and possibly illegal?) they were. He's 13, and I am worried about how his development now is going to impact his adult life. Issues obviously need to be addressed now before they become bigger problems.

* I really really can't learn English, Irish or French, I haven't learned any beyond 'what is your name' and the answer in irish and that is it, I don't know any French at all and am really bad at any 'opinion' questions in English.

* I am really bad at handwriting, I'll [this](http://imgur.com/3hw3VCF) pic show you

* When I was younger I had to go to a special teacher to learn things like handwriting and spelling, I also when to a speech therapist for a few years and when to some kind of doctor play thing, all I remember of that is me playing, me trying to keep my arm from moving when she pushed against it and me trying to flip half red half blue wooden pills from one side to the other only using my hand.

* I don't go outside for any other then my family, I have never been to a party, pub, club, friends home or anything. and have no desire to do so.

*  I am really good at all my science subjects, I do higher level physics, biology, maths and geography. I remember hearing some where that people with autism are good with facts and figures.

* People some times tell me I act strange around them.

* I got told by more then one teacher I was the quietest student they ever had.

* I don't understand peoples feelings sometimes, like when my grandad died everyone was crying and stuff but I didn't really care because he didn't really do much or understand why they care, everyone talked about how much they hated him before that and then they cry when he is gone? I didn't hate him, I just didn't care.

I work security at a Hospital. Earlier this night I got a call from the ER stating that a mentally disabled woman had walked out of the hospital while her mother was getting treatment. After I began the search I found out she was an autistic child. Long story short I found her down the road a little ways from the hospital. Now, I know not to touch them. I know that autistic children don't necessarily like being touch. I also understand that they are not good at communication. I walked up to her in as soothing voice I could, called her by name, introduced myself, and asked if she wanted to go back to her mother (Or 'Momma') After trying that for a few minute I got down on my knees so I was lower than her. At that point she ran up and hugged/tackled me. She was a 23 year old in what looked like a body of a 10 year old, shes not that light...and I'm not that strong...It ended with me sitting on the grass holding her like a baby trying to convince her to get up. Finally some other staff showed up, everyone picked her up, and put her in the back of a car (me included). When we got back to the hospital, her sister had just arrived and managed to get her out of the car. Keep in mind the mother couldn't show up because she was already admitted into the hospital (I find the reason...shaky...but I just work security, their business is theirs)

I feel like I could have done more. So parents, friends, teachers, what points do you have for me (and others) for possible future cases?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1n5wl3/how_can_a_stranger_help_a_lost_autistic_child/,59

320,Does light/sound overstimulation ebb and flow?,"Curious here.... I have 2.5 year old with autism.  He has pretty much across the board been sensory under sensitive or sensory seeking.  Loud sounds, crowds don't bother him.  Same with bright lights, toys that flash or spin.  He honestly can't get enough of them.

I've noticed a change in the past month or so where he's been covering his ears in different situations.  He does it with his speech therapist, but I think the behavior there is more avoidance than actual sensitivity.  He was doing it last night when we were watching a ""scary"" part of movie that we have seen many, many times.  He was also doing it the other day when we were watching a football game on television.

He also has a favorite toy at preschool, a car that he pushes around.  The batteries in have long been dead, but he just loves to push it.  Today, one of the teachers put fresh batteries in and he discovered that the wheels would spin and lights would flash on them.  It was incredibly stimulating and all he wanted to do was watch the wheels.  Because the behavior was so stimulatory, they then took the toy away, which caused a meltdown.  I am fine with letting him stim, and I let him spin wheels at home because he does not perseverate on it, but this was clearly way overstimulating for him and it took him 40 min to recover after the toy was taken away.

I'm just wondering if he's now becoming more sensitive to lights and sounds?  

Have any other parents experienced a change in sensitivity in their children, or can any teens/adults on the spectrum speak to this?

Just FYI, he doing really well in OT and experiencing a language burst, so there's a lot going on in his little mind at the moment.

I am a dad of a 4 year old on the autistic spectrum.

We definitely want to see him improve in these areas. I found a number of websites that have parents talking about improvement triggers. A lot of them pointed to diet.

One thing that puzzles me is that, he is a good solid eater, in the 95% percentile on height and 90% on weight. He never really showed digestive issues.

So while there is a correlation between diet and triggers, according to so many folks, I am quite confused. So I wonder if there is a parent here who tried dietary methods/probiotics etc though the child showed no signs of digestive disorders. And did it bring about improvements?

337,Advice on using sarcasm with a PDD-NOS friend,"So I've been dating this girl for a while now and, after about a week of hanging out, it became clear to me that she had some sort of autism spectrum disorder. More recently, she finally opened up to me about being diagnosed with PDD-NOS back in college, which more-or-less fit with my general impression of her given her sensory integration issues, language difficulties, forgetfulness, and inability to pick up certain social cues.

While we're very happy together, truth be told I'm generally a very sarcastic person--so natural a communication mechanism is it to me that I don't often even think about it. As you can imagine, this can cause significant confusion to one who doesn't understand sarcasm or know how to identify it. On one laughable occasion, I joked about having never really done anything illegal, not even stealing a pack of gum, well, *except for that one guy I ran over*. Missing the sarcasm, she genuinely thought I had killed someone, until, using a safeword (""nutmeg"") that we came up with to indicate sarcasm, I assured her I hadn't and that it was just a joke.

On the one hand, I understand that, to an extent, she can't help her difficulty with recognizing sarcasm, and that I need to try to be patient with her. At the same time, sarcasm is, to me, one of my most natural modes of communication, with which I conduct a significant portion my interactions with other people. To completely eliminate sarcasm would be at odds with my character, and, in some instances, being straight-forward is not easy (since sarcasm is often used to eschew vulnerability).

So, to my point, **how can we help each other understand each other better**? While ""nutmeg"" has helped a little, since I've virtually eliminate sarcasm with her I still don't feel that I can talk to her ""naturally"". Still, I understand I can't just be my normal sarcastic self and expect her to pick up on things. Is there a way to meet in the middle, so that I can communicate in a way that is both ""natural"" to me and also intelligible to her?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1mfbf0/advice_on_using_sarcasm_with_a_pddnos_friend/,263

340,My conflict on having high-functioning autism,"Hey guys, I'm new to the /autism forums and reddit in general.

I was diagnosed with Asperger's when I was just eight years old, I never really had friend's growing up. My dad's Autistic too while my mom's weird but normal. I was always incredibly smart with all academic topics but always struggled to make friends. I was always extremely socially awkward growing up. I started making friends and hanging out with people when I was about 16 or so, even then I was the strange one in the group.

At 22 I had my first girlfriend (which ended soon after) and after that I just socialized as much as I could, read up online, and asked my friends to call me out on all the mistakes I'd make on a daily basis which came off as awkward/creepy, and how I could do better. In a strange twist of events, my best friends are nothing like me, 

I'm now 25. I've graduated university (have a bachelor's in, ironically, sociology). Since then I've gone through invisalign (my parent's never got me braces), I don't wear clothes from the thrift shop, I'm careful not to come off as desperate (as that translates as creepy), I use Retin-A every night and take really good care of myself (I look a lot better than I use to, which I think helps) I've worked really hard to get my people skills really good. I constantly ask my friends (who are good with these things) for feedback on what I do wrong and what I can do different.

At this point when I go out girls just come up to me and start conversations, I hook up with a girl every few weeks but so far none of them have stuck. I keep getting better and I'm confident that will change. I have better then average social skills, and I'm pretty much able to make friends with anyone.

At this point no one would ever know that I was born with autism. Only my best, best friend knows about that, and he's an extremely bright person who understands the complete story. I feel really conflicted about this sometimes, I feel like I'm keeping a secret from the world, and I'm very unsure on how everyone would take it if they knew about my history. I feel like they'd say something like ""Oh, so you use to be retarded"", or think less of me. I'm scared it would radically change the way that they think about me.

I have strong social skills now, but at the core essence, deep down, I feel like I think differently than everyone else. I was better at math and computers than most my teachers when I was around ten. I have a ridiculous memory, yet sometimes I make the most basic mistakes when it comes to social skills.

I'm extremely bright, I wouldn't change that for the world, and it pains me when I see all these ""autism awareness"" bumper stickers. Awareness hasn't done anything for me, and I'm quite glad my peers have always been unaware. The only way I've been able to build my social skills is one on one counseling with close friends, and only then was I able to make up for a sixteen year deficit in development. 

Reviewing papers, I was iniitially classified as speech and language impaired due to a language delay in 2nd grade, and a psychiatric evaluation at age 8 diagnosed me with Asperger's due to poor abstract thinking, pragmatic language deficits, poor social skills, and obsessive/perseverative behaviors. Remembering back at my mentality growing up, there is no question I had autism.

It really upsets me when people talk bad about autism/asperger's syndrome, and how it's a disease/sickness. While I certainly struggled in some areas, I identify as having neurological diversity and feel I could really help people with my condition develop strong people skills. And I feel like having autism is a part of personality, and the thought of a ""cure"" is insulting. It really upsets me that soon, there will be genetic testing to wipe out the existence of people like me, and I hope I can one day change the mind of the people who would do so.

I've been typing this for twenty minutes now and it came out a little longer then I expected :) I feel like I could write a book on my perspective of being someone with autism, in a group of friends of very social people. So down to the point. Am I special, do I stand out? Or is there a lot of people like me secretly out there. Should I keep it a secret, should I consider myself part of the autism community? Am I autistic for life? Or am I someone who simply use to be autistic. Sometimes I'm curious what my friends and psych major ex-gf would think if they knew. Sometimes I'm scared they'd pretty much just pitty me, and not understand how I'm just like anyway else who has struggled with an issue.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1m7yl5/my_conflict_on_having_highfunctioning_autism/,265
341,My youngest is at elevated risk for autism (2.5yrs old). I need advice.,"I have two wonderful little ones, aged 3.5 and 2.5. The oldest has always been super advanced and ridiculously extroverted, while the youngest is a bit of a loner. I blame myself for not being able to give the little one (Amelia) the same attention the older one (Zofia) got. Mostly because Zofia will steal any attention given to her younger sister.


I need advice on how to progress, what to keep an eye out for, and how to give Amelia more attention without Zofia feeling left out or forgotten about. This is a very stressful time in our lives, even without the autism worry; and I just don't know where to even start.


EDIT: You're all a fantastic bunch of people. Thanks for the concerns and advice.

343,"IamA 27 year old Dutch guy with PDD-NOS, form of autism spectrum disorder and would like to give you a peek in my world AMA!","Hi I'm Patrick and I live in Holland in my own apartment with a form of assistance. I have a job which in not that special and I am a Dj as a hobby. As the title tells you I have a form of autism formally known as PDD-NOS and now falls under the the term ASS Syndrome (I have heard)

I want to give advice to parents and just talk to other people witch autism. 

Here's the thing: I am very self dependent when it comes to living. I am a male so it's hard to maintain a household like a women can. Sure I do laundry and that stuff and I am also very good with money. I guess I'm typical male. 

On top of that I also have a couple of friends and even had some close ones, still do. I enjoy frienships and I am very socially skilled, I have learned a lot!! But no real 'relationship' yet. A lot of my social skills I learned from my dad and just through living life, messing up..learning from mistakes.  I also read books on social behavior, it's intriguing to me so that must have been helping a lot.  

I do not feel different than anybody else..not smarter and most certainly not dumber. I am very well aware when people judge me and put themself above me, when they do I let them know how I feel about that. I can read body language and all hat stuff I learned. Did you know there are also a lot of people that are unable to show empathy or just don't know how they are coming across. I mean they have no clue when they hurt someones feelings and most of those people aren't even diagnosed with anything. Lol does that mean there normal?? ;)

I am happy with what I have achieved so far, except for an education I am pretty much set.

I want to tell parents this: Yours kids can do ANYTHING when you just encourage it. Do not give up!

Don't treat your autistic child as though it can't do anything. Teach them whatever can help them.. even if they don't seem interested. Sure they might take longer to get something.. but it will pay of as long as you do NOT give up!  

Also and this is my personal opinion. Don't give them to many shortcuts in life. what I mean by that is that you keep doing stuff because they ind it hard... just because something is hard does not mean they don't have to do it or can't learn it. 

You don't want them to be a baby forever right?

Ok I would like to answer questions ;)

(Always wanted 4 kids, got that with less work lol) anyhoo, my oldest tends to act out more then nornal when the step children (lets abbreviate this to SC) are around. I don't know why, when SC are present I treat them all the same. Everyone gets equal attention and the same amount of everything. I make it fair. Yet my kid acts out. From repeated bad behaviour, doing things he knows (I stress knows) is wrong, being physical towards the other kids in a joking manner which I feel isn't appropriate and ive told him this. To just regressing. I don't know if this is normal, nor are the so called dr and psychologists that I speak with. One minute he will go from nice boy who plays great with others to demon child who is hell bent on distroying the other kids. Wtf kid?! I've sat him down numerous times and asked him what gives? What's up and all that. I always get ""I forget. I dunno"". 
I've done the whole- seperate time with him where I pull him away from the other kids and spend one on one time, just talking. Asking him questions,  letting him help out with small food prep, cleaning, whatever yet i still get this crap. 
He adores all the kids, he speaks about the SC when the SC go home, I'm out of ideas here.

353,Children Awaiting Parents - helping hard-to-place children find permanent homes [charity] [x-post with r/disability],"I'm a regular poster and commenter here, but this charity thing is linked to my real name, so I'm using a throwaway.

Children Awaiting Parents is an organization that tries to find permanent, adoptive families for ""hard-to-place"" children in foster care, especially kids with disabilities. Without an active effort to place these kids, adoptive families can be scared off by the possibility of raising a child with autism, significant medical needs, or a mobility impairment.

CAP finds adoptive families and then provides pre and post adoption support. It's really unfortunate that these kids who often need dedicated and stable parents the most are often the least likely to get them, without the support and assistance of an organization like CAP.

Their organization website is www.childrenawaitingparents.org if you'd like to learn more about them. My family and I are participating in a fundraising walk.

355,A place to vent when you have no support?,"Hi everyone. I recently found this sub and it is wonderful. I am not sure if this is the kind of thing that gets posted here, but sometimes dealing with austim is hard on the parent as well.

My daughter is 10 and gets TSS twice a week for an hour on tuesdays and wednesdays. She is labeled High functioning severe. She has come a long way in the past few years and is generally doing well.

But today during TSS. Something just wasnt right. Now when we first started the TSS she would spit, claw,kick,bite scream at the top of her lungs ect all in an attempt to get out of doing something she didnt want to do. As her father, and being a generally big guy,  this never bothered me. I can keep my cool pretty well. Her hitting and biting me was ignored to show her those things arent going to make her get her way.

Fast forward 2 years later she rarely tantrums like that any more, and while she complains about coming to do her work with the TSS, she still does it generally well with minimal prompting. But for some reason tonight she just wanted no part of it. She screamed, kicked, slapped me hard acrossed the face and generally lost every single ""fun"" thing she could possibly do for the rest of the night. By the end of the session, we got her to do 2 things before the time was up. ( We do tss at my ex wifes house, and i leave immediately after to go to work at night)

I've never let a tantrum get to me before. But tonight for some reason it did. She actually cried she was so upset. I went up to her room after TSS was over and attempted to talk to her, all she did was hug me and cry. Which in turn after the whole ordeal had me in tears pretty much the whole way to work. 

It's hard to describe how I felt. Angry is not the word, and disappointed is a word i hate to say when it comes to my daughter. But even now sitting at work thinking about it still upsets me. And is why I am here venting. How do parents deal with something their child did that disappointed them?

In the last few weeks he has been showing a desire to play with random children rather than be with the family. I know I can't always protect him, but when I can, I want to.

We were at my parents summer trailer and some kids were playing soccer on half of a field. My son had ran over and tried playing with them but they told him to leave. So I got a cousin and a soccer ball and began playing on the other side with my son. Some more kids showed up and they came over and asked if they could use the net since there was only the 3 of us playing. I took the kid aside and said "" You can have the net if you let my son play, he's different and will act weird. Be nice or I will come back."" He said sure.

He doesn't really grasp the sport yet and he his communication skills are still very lacking, we put him in a summer league last year but he didn't seem to enjoy it. He just ran around (didn't touch the ball once) and played in their area but not with them. I was a hawk and kept my eye on him.

375,Going thru a trial separation with a 5 year old high functioning autistic child.,"Need some advice about going thru a separation. Not asking for relationship help but more concerned about how to make things better for my son. We've agreed that we would alternate weekends and I would be able to see him on any weekdays as long as I provide 24 hour notice. He will be staying with his mom at our house, which we recently bought, so he doesnt have to change schools for 6 months or longer. He just started kindergarten and we just moved into our new house. He's doing ok with in school and loves the new house. We both want him to not have to adjust to a new place. 

My son is very sensitive sweet child. Very rarely we would fight in front of him but he would sit and cry if he saw us fighting or even when we would pretend fight.  I can't bear the thought of hurting him but I know that he'll have some trouble dealing with the fact that I wont be around as much. 

Before I had a job that required some travel and he ended up having terrible separation anxiety when I was gone. He would cry and never want to leave my side (even when I went to the bathroom). Now hes a mamma's boy and it does hurt that he doesnt want to be around me as much but I know he loves me. 

Is there any other tips so we don't stress him out. Its hard cause he's too young to understand the change and I know when he doesnt see me for some time he ask, ""where's daddy or is daddy coming home soon?"".

377,Ideas for developing educational games for autistic children,"I have an autistic nephew having trouble getting a handle on multiplication. After researching some different ideas I got the general sense that key to success is to make learning visual (or otherwise engage multiple senses). He is really into video games, and I feel like that is an effective way to engage him and demonstrate these abstract ideas. I know that some educational software exists, but in my experience they are never very fun.

My life experience with autism is limited to my nephew and a few friends with aspergers. I'm hoping that r/autism can give me a better sense of what game mechanics are good at holding attention. This is something I am doing in my free time, and I plan to freely share the result if it is worth sharing. I want to tackle math first, but I may branch out into other subjects such as vocab/spelling, grammar, and the sciences.

What type of games do you or your child enjoy? 
*Simpler games like those on phones/tablets/xbox arcade are probably more helpful.*

Is there a specific genre that is better than the others?
*simulation, crafting/building, shooter, strategy, rpg, etc*

What aspects of games cause the most frustration?
*Too fast paced, micromanaging, difficulty increases too quickly, etc*

Do you have any general ideas?

382,"/r/Autism, please help me to understand my brother's response.","Let me just start out by saying that my older brother has Asperger's syndrome, and that we generally get along (except, of course, when we don't). I'm currently getting my master's in nutrition, and I've been really interested in the auto-immune/autism connection. I casually brought up an article I was reading about the gluten-free diet and celiac, and we somehow got on the topic of the auto-immune/autism connection. He got really angry, said that there was no auto-immune/autism connection and that people who say that are just schmucks who either think they can ""fix"" autistic kids who just want to be left alone or who are selling snake oil to parents of autistic kids. I told him that there's a big difference between nutritionists who recommend gluten-free and/or elimination diets and supplementation for children with autism and what he's talking about. Where I work, I get the opportunity to talk with a lot of mothers of children with autism, and for many of them, their children's experience with diet experimentation and supplementation is largely positive. He said something to the effect of that he has no sympathy for mothers like that because they just want their children to be fixed. I pulled up some of the research that examines connections between auto-immune disorders and autism to show him and that seemed to end the argument.

However, I was left wondering if this is really a sensitive issue for kids with autism spectrum disorders and/or parents. Are there any people who can comment on this?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1kqycq/rautism_please_help_me_to_understand_my_brothers/,295

I've contacted ADAP and have an appointment by phone Friday. His orientation was weird. They just kind of ignored his autism. I spoke with his teacher and principle about him. Left him a comfort box and told them all about the potty issue, which they all act like is no big deal. The principle tells me to send a letter requesting an IEP with him to school but then tells me it takes up to 8 weeks to begin! I know good and well they are required to within 30 days but don't confront him because I'm speaking with ADAP so soon. So Sunday his principle leaves a voicemail saying it's been brought to his attention That my son isn't potty trained ( as if I never told him) and that I'll be required to come to the school and assist him everytime. Now I have a 10 month old at home, I cant always drop everything and drive over. I'm not sure what to do between him starting school tomorrow and talking to ADAP Friday. He's gonna need help but I won't always be there and going by the way they're acting Im scared to leave him alone there.

Things that used to be relatively simple for me (fixing the computer, talking, dealing with the techs that come out to the house (I'm helping a family member get all of their phone/cable/internet set up), driving) now have me paralyzed in fear, or I just...blank out and forget.

I'm also engaging in repetitive behaviours that I haven't since I was a child. I'm toe-walking (and bouncing) again, organizing things to a point where if they're wrong I start screaming (sigh). The sensory sensitivity is at an all-time high. It's not pleasant and it's not good. I'm a grown adult and yet for some reason I feel as if my head has done a 360.

I've not had this happen before. I've never experienced regression to this kind of level. I've had meltdowns, and sensory issues, but those are easily tackleable with extricating myself from the situation, or if I'm at home, burritoing in a pile of blankets and watching things I like, or taking a nap.

I'm in a bad place emotionally and mentally, and a bit stressed but nothing that would necessitate this kind of reaction pattern from me. I'm concerned; this is not a good pattern that I'm in and it doesn't help that lately I've been having some pretty gnarly night sweats, stomach pain and my cat has been reallllllly clingy to the point of screaming when he can't find me or I leave.

The issue was me trying to get him to clean his room. He told me he didn't have to do anything he didn't want to and that I had to provide him with everything he asked for and that I could not ground him from anything I had given him because it was his once I gave it and I couldn't take it away (X-box, bicycle, radio, TV).

I told him if he was able to see a positive difference in his life he could continue to take medication, or if he didn't like it he didn't have to). I was told by the officer that I am not the first parent who has asked for help with their child but that there is not anything he could do to help me short of having him arrested for assault(I was hoping they could have him admitted to an institution).

390,Horrible experience,"My son is almost 3 and has been diagnosed in the mild range of autism. He is currently nonverbal, though he is making great strides in early intervention. His child psychologist has also been exploring the possibility of a sensory processing disorder.

We noticed a few months ago that one of his eyes seemed to be going lazy. I got a referral to a children's opthamologist from our pedi. I didn't want to waste any time because two of my uncles had lazy eyes that required several surgeries, as well as my own brother and my husban's sister.

Our appointment was today and I had called in advance to let them know he has autism and make sure it would not be a problem. (Been turned away from dentists in the past because of autism.) They assured me it was no problem and that they had specialized staff.

The nurse, assistant, whatever her title was, she was very friendly and gentle with my son. He didn't put up much of a fight for the drops to dilate his eyes and was fine after that.

The actual doctor comes in and my son starts to panic. (Meltdowns are not common with him.) I was holding him trying to calm him down. The doctor alternated between trying to force lights in his eyes and smiling &amp; laughing while staring at his computer screen. I was trying to explain to him the autism and the possible SPD, and the doctor just completely ignored me. He didn't even acknowledge my presence in the room and certainly didn't speak to me or listen to anything I was saying.

Without saying a word, he gets up and leaves the fucking room. I calm my son down and play puzzle games with him. Doctor was gone about 20 minutes and then returned with the nurse. The nurse asks me to sit in the exam chair and hold my son.

Next thing I know, she has his head pinned against me and is holding his arms down while the doctor pins his legs against me and pries (I feel like I'm spelling that wrong) open my sons eyes and begins shining the lights to do the exam.

He spends no more than 30 seconds examining both eyes and then says ""He doesn't need glasses, you can go.""

He was acting like a complete fucking asshole. I'm trying to calm my son down and gather my things (my mom was with me and so was my 5 month old son). My son is screaming and hyperventilating and all I can focus on is calming him down. It wasn't even a meltdown, he was fucking terrified. The doctor is in such a rush that he starts picking up our things to hand us as he's opening the door, motioning us out, with out saying a word still.

My son screamed the entire way out to the car. Once in the car he was still hyperventilating, his face was red and purple, tears running down his cheeks, and he just kept letting out the most heart breaking whimpers.

He still didn't calm down &amp; return to his normal for half a fucking hour.

I don't even know what to think. 

This is the same kid that doesn't flinch when he gets shots, that did fine when he had his ears checked, fine at the dentist, hell - he didn't even react as much when he dislocated his elbow and had to have it popped back in. I know my son and this fucking scared him.

I don't even know what to think. I checked in advance. Whether they lied and didn't have staff for autistic or special needs children, or they were just tired and didn't give a shit... I don't know.

He didn't even discuss with me why my son has a lazy eye, what we should watch for, if he should have a check up. Nothing. He wanted us out the moment he saw that my son was difficult.

Is this common? Is it common for people to be so shitty towards autistic children and their families? I don't know if I can get used to that.

But I am going to call the pedi first thing in the morning and ask for a referral to a different eye doc because I do not trust this one, and to let them know they probably should not refer children with special needs to this doctor.

391,"Meet my brother Jonathan. He is 24 years old and is profoundly autistic. He loves movies, musicals, G.I. Joe toys and Youtube. He is a marathon runner, and will run his 11th marathon this November in New York City. Check out his story!","Meet my brother Jonathan.

Jonathan Brunot was born on March 14, 1989, a healthy child with an expressive personality. He was the youngest of three sons and as a baby he was very socially interactive with lots of eye contact, and his vocabulary built steadily as he began to learn to speak. However, when he was about 2½ years of age, he began to regress dramatically. His eye contact became non-existent and the few words and even phrases he had mastered in the previous months slipped away into completely non-verbal interaction. Jonathan was diagnosed as severely autistic, and the lives of the Brunot family changed dramatically from that moment.

Olga, Jonathan's mother, galvanized that family around the diagnosis. She approached Jonathan's autism in a powerful yet unique way that would become a consistent theme throughout Jonathan's development.

Jonathan wasn’t merely an “autistic” individual; collectively, they were an “autistic” family. 

Throughout Jonathan's development, this mantra was behind much of the decision making regarding finding the appropriate schooling and activities for Jonathan. Olga sought out as many special needs programs as possible.  As Jonathan went through his teenage years he was enrolled and engaged in a plethora of activities, such as horseback riding, swimming, and basketball, among others. The goal was to maximize Jonathan's opportunities in life and find his niche. Because of Jonathan's inability to proactively pursue new activities and endeavors, Olga took it upon herself to effectively “throw him in the deep end” and immerse him in EVERYTHING.

It was precisely this determination and persistence that prompted Olga to have Jonathan join a special needs running program called Rolling Thunder in 2007. The volunteer coaches at Rolling Thunder specialized in assisted running with the mentally disabled and they welcomed Jonathan with open arms.

When Jonathan first joined the running club he struggled tremendously. For the first couple of weeks, he could not run more than 10-15 yards without stopping, getting distracted, or wanting to lie down. In fact, Olga began running side by side with Jonathan, at times gripping his waistband to literally pull him along the trails. Despite 2 months of weekly practices, Jonathan was still not really grasping the concept of running. Olga, exhausted from pulling his weight and exasperated by his lack of progress, was ready to quit and move her son on to another activity.

Thankfully, the head coach of Rolling Thunder, Steve Cuomo, refused to allow Olga to give up on the process. He informed Olga that the point of the program was to keep pushing, even when the outcome looked bleak. It was that conversation and Olga's ultimate decision to continue with the program which led to the fateful day when Olga was introduced to a volunteer running coach named Vincent Del-cid.

Coach Vincent needed only one week to get Jonathan to finish a 3 mile trail without stopping. He saw potential in Jonathan and made it clear to Olga that he was prepared to commit to Jonathan's progress long term.

Over the next year, under Coach Vincent's weekly training, Jonathan underwent an amazing transformation. Physically, Jonathan lost around 25 pounds, as he became comfortable running longer distances and trained 3 times a week. He went from 15 minutes per mile (for a 5k race) all the way down to under 8 minutes! Socially, Jonathan was developing a clear love and passion for the sport of running. On “running” days, Jonathan would come from school happy and eager to put on his shorts and sneakers to go run with Coach Vincent.

Jonathan had found his niche; he was a runner and he loved to run.

After a year and a half of consistent training, Jonathan was running 5k and 10k races almost every weekend and the Brunot family was proud and excited to rally behind his accomplishments. However, Coach Vincent decided to REALLY up the ante.

Coach Vincent informed the family that he intended to train Jonathan to run and finish the ING NYC Marathon. He challenged that family to put their trust in him to help Jonathan successfully navigate 26.2 long, difficult miles across all the boroughs of Manhattan! Coach Vincent had already accomplished so much with Jonathan that this new goal simply became the next challenge.

On November 2, 2008 (at the age of 19) Jonathan completed his FIRST marathon in 4 grueling hours and 49 minutes and 8 seconds. He battled through cramps and frequent bathroom breaks to finally reach the finish line in Central Park with his family happily and loudly cheering for his accomplishments from the finish line bleachers.

Today, Jonathan Brunot is a charming, 24 year old, autistic marathon runner. He has 10 marathons and 1 ultra-marathon under his belt and is showing ZERO signs of slowing down.

Despite his incredible success as a runner, Jonathan's autism can still present tremendous difficulties. Jonathan can't regulate his bodily needs, so his coaches are always nearby to keep him well hydrated and help him replenish his electrolytes, as well as to deal with any of the potentially dangerous situations that can arise when running amongst tens of thousands of runners. In many ways, Jonathan's coaches take on the role of coach, parent, medic, nutritionist and special needs instructor each and every time they sacrifice their bodies to help him reach the finish line.

Yes, autism is a lifelong neurological disorder, but with lots of love, positive attitude and training, an autistic individual is only limited by the constraints that we put upon them. The joy and happiness that we experience as a family each time we see Jonathan run towards the finish line cannot be encapsulated in words.

Jonathan's running has given us a beautiful gift – an experience that galvanizes us around our champion and his triumphs. In essence, we are rewarded every time we see him put on his running shoes; beset by a gleaming smile and an eagerness to get out some of that boundless energy by running for miles and miles. 

Jonathan is my youngest brother. He could not speak or write this on his own so I had to speak for him. Jonathan inspires me each and every day... and he doesn't even know it! We don't care about his time or his pace; watching Jonathan run is one of the most fulfilling experiences of our lives, and we are simply overjoyed that he can keep this gift for as long as his legs can carry him.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1k7rb6/meet_my_brother_jonathan_he_is_24_years_old_and/,301

I totally realize it is my fault, and with that, I worry constantly. That they will leave me, find someone new/better, etc. I can not express how horrible it is to constantly be worried that someone who says they love you, and won't go anywhere, will do just that with no remorse. 
It might come down to the fact that I wouldn't want to be with me. I am annoying when I am frustrated, I become enraged easily when that happens. I know how childish it seems, but its honestly like I can't control it.

I don't have these problems with him. He does throw tantrums, but nothing severe and nothing I can't handle. A little talk, removing from the situation that sent him over the edge, redirection etc, it's very easy for me to keep a full melt-down from happening. 

His daycare and school never reported excessive meltdowns. The few people I let babysit, no problems there either. My SO handles him just fine as well. 

So I'm feeling like it's a routine/handling issue with the ex. I offered to sit down and talk it out to maybe discover what we do differently. He said he will because I want to, but he's ready for meds. 

I don't feel like he needs them, but I'm worried I'm going to stand here and say no, no matter what, when maybe there is something out there that would help. I don't want to drug my kid to appease my ex, but I don't want to keep something helpful from him just to stand my ground. 

Anyone who uses meds that would like to share your story, that would be wonderful. I think my hesitation comes mostly from a place of fear. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1jyscj/ex_wants_to_medicate_our_5_year_old_autistic_son/,304
398,Does anybody else have an adult sibling with autism?,"My brother is 4 years older than myself (I'm 26, he's 30), and while he has a limited vocabulary (like what a 2-year-old would have), he has ALWAYS seemed to me to be neuro-typical in understanding what was going on, just with major anxiety issues and trouble adjusting to new routines.

I guess what I'm saying is that I don't know any other way than having a sibling with autism (he still lives at home, and we grew up together), and to me, he is person who just can't talk, has poor impulse control, and gets anxious in public sometimes. Of course, it's more than that.

What are your experiences with siblings with autism? Do they speak? Are they older or younger than yourself? Do you feel like people underestimate their ability to comprehend the world around them? Did you ever get into any fights sticking up for them as a kid? What things could you not do because of their autism, and what things did you make sure you could do?

I remember once we took my brother to the movie theater to see Cats &amp; Dogs because he loves animals (those are some of the words he can say, as well). He was about 19 or so, and every time a cat or dog was on screen, he would go, ""CAT! DOOOOGGGG!"" My little sister and I did not give one fuck about anybody else.

399,Curious about autism,"I feel I could possibly have autism. I lack knowledge on the subject and thus I turn to you.

I will tell you little about myself ,although I'm not sure if this is pertinent, helpful or of useful information; as I am,again, lacking knowledge on the subject.

Since the young ages of interaction to now I feel a disconnect from my other peers. I find myself bonding with animals more frequently than with people. I have already been diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, anxiety, bi-polar disorder ,and am a recovering anorexic. ( sounds like a lot but I went through cognitive behavioral therapy and my OCD and anxiety are greatly manageable today and have little impact on my life now). I find speaking to people very demanding and exhausting( not on a narcissistic level, just plain overwhelming). I have heightened skills with music and art which I tend to spend many hours by myself doing. 

I don't exactly know what I should look for and I am not ""trying"" to have autism. I am 21 years old and have lived a good life thus far without a diagnosis ,but I am wondering if it could possibly be apart of my life. Information welcomed and I can provide more information about my situation.

My 2 year old was recently diagnosed with autism a mild to moderate case. I never noticed any regression he never had speech, never pointed and had poor eye contact. He has always babbled since a young age but no words ever formed. Before he was tested for autism. I took my own initiative and had his hearing checked, and it came back normal. I also had a full blood workup done including testing for lead and everything came up normal. I have a follow up appointment next week to discuss treatment plans. As I am doing further research before my follow up appointment. I read some things on additional testing for fragile X syndrome, EEG, and MRI. Hes only 2 and I don't want to put him though the ringer for all these tests, but I think it might be useful to rule out anything else.

402,What can I do to better engage a fragile x syndrome child?,"I just finished the first week of a month-long babysitting gig for two boys, a 15 year old (has fragile x syndrome) and his brother (13).  Basically, all the boy with fragile x syndrome does is ask me a lot of the same 25 or so questions over and over again (what are we doing today?  Tomorrow?  Where is mommy?  Is she walking home?  Is it sunny outside?  Do I have school tomorrow?).  I answer him each time, trying to explain any sort of variation.  I do kind of enjoy going through the day and explaining why we have to go somewhere, so I don't mind it... But I was just wondering if there was a better way I could go about it instead of just answering him all the time.  I sometimes say ""I just told you!  You know what it is, how about you tell me?"" and he tells me.  Not sure if that helps, though.   

Another thing is he really only plays wii or watches TV for the whole 6 hours I am there.  He wants me to play with him, so I play with him for the last 2 or so hours.  I ask him if he wants to go for a walk outside, he says no thank you.  I ask him if he wants to draw, he says no, etc... Everything other than the wii or TV he says no to.  Even though he likes going to the pool (according to his mom), this past week he has NOT wanted to go swimming once.

So that's basically it... just wondering if there are any tips people can give me to help him do different things or converse a bit better with me.  Thanks!

411,Growing concern for a young family member: advice/perspective on his possible needs.,"TLDR: I suspect my sister is in denial about her son and he's not getting the help he needs. What is the typical protocol for diagnosis, and what are the best practices for helping him?


I admit up front I am not very educated in this subject, so please go easy on me if I ignorantly stick my foot in my mouth in some way causing offense. Hmmm, where to start? I (and several other family members) suspect my 10 year old nephew falls somewhere on the autism/aspergers spectrum. After the most recent visit with family, my concern for his overall wellbeing is growing and I'd love some perspective as I'm not sure what, if anything, I should or could do to help. I don't want to go into all the long details of his family life, but I think his parents are in denial about his needs.


He started taking ADHD meds at age 4. The people who evaluated him said he tested off the charts for it. I don't know the exact amounts, but he takes medicine 4 times a day and then needs a different medication at night to help bring him down so he can sleep. He's painfully thin, as he usually has no appetite. I know at some point later in elementary school he was evaluated and that report included either the word autism or aspergers. However, my sister has been very cagey in mentioning further details. I'm not sure how much of a diagnosis they have. However, when our mother tried to ask her she said insurance covered a psychiatrist visit every 6 weeks and that seems to be all they've done. She doesn't seem interested in educating herself further on what he may be facing, seeking further diagnosis or treatment options, or providing him or their family with tools to better deal with his needs.


Some details on what makes those around him suspect it's more than ADHD:
~He's always had trouble with eye contact, it's next to impossible with him
~When he's together with all his cousins, they are all playing and interacting together and he's just kind of zoned out in his own world
~He gets terribly anxious about all kinds of things kids shouldn't worry about, it's very common for his parents and other adults around him to say something to the effect of ""Don't worry about it."" An example would be one time I was helping out unloading groceries into their fridge and he started freaking out that I was putting the fruit in the wrong place and how would we XYZ if the fruit was there?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1jbpgh/growing_concern_for_a_young_family_member/,312

There I met a young man who experiences autism and developed a rather endearing tactile obsession with my beard. And that's about when the idea hit me. My plan is to accept donations to a charitable organization to provide me motivation to keep the beard going strong and to aid a group of people I have come to care deeply about.

414,My 2 year old is having his autism evaluation in a few days. I could use some advise or just words of encouragement.,"I'm looking for guidance or encouragement. I am a mother of a 2 year old he turned two in May his name is Harrison. I was referred to ECI just before his 2nd birthday do to a speech delay. At 2 years old he had no real words. Always babbling and lots of gibberish. Other then that I never noticed any else. He is my only child. I myself was the youngest of four children and neither myself or husband were familiar with babies or young children before Harrison came along. Working with ECI in the last few months Harrison now says bye bye, and mama. ECI suggested he be tested for autism. This was a shock to me no one in my family is autistic and I was unaware Harrison had any autistic traits. ADD/ADHD runs in my family and effects ALL the males. Also my husband has ADD and is medicated for it currently. So if anything I assumed it was that. My son ignores us a lot when we talk to him as if he can't hear us. (I had his hearing checked and he can indeed hear). He occasionally responds to his name only if he's not engaged in something else. If he busy playing he will not respond, but if he's not doing anything and he's not distracted he will respond almost every time. I also had blood work done after reading iron deficiencies can cause a speech delay, but blood work came back normal. He will do a task if i ask him, but i have to tell him several times before he will do it. He had little to no eye contacted before the age of 2, but now has excellent eye contact (we worked pretty hard on this).

He's very very hyper and moves from one task to another quickly he's always on the go. He does flap his hands when he's excited, and spins. The spinning happens 1-2 times a day for only a min or two. He always looks down at his feet when doing so. His OT suggested he has SPD so we have been doing some techniques she suggested to help him. He has sleep issues he's up playing in the middle of the night for an hour or two babbling to himself and jumping up and down until he falls back to sleep. The men in my family were headbangers (I hate that word) anyways, they would bang their heads in order to go to sleep. Harrison doesn't do that, but his sleep disturbances might be some form of that. He plays with toys appropriately although he does sometimes analyze them first. He does lots of pretend play. He's great with adults he will easily sit in a strangers lap (although that may not be a good thing). he plays with me and my husband he never wants to play alone. If nothing else he insists we are in the same room with him as he plays. He shows plenty of emotions if I'm sad he's sad, If my happy he's happy, I smile he smiles. As for playing with his peers he does not. When he's around other children his age he kind of ignores them or stares at them. He will parallel play sometimes but not engage with them. (I'm told parallel play is normal for his age) I am a stay at home mom and he's never been around kids his age up until recently. I blame myself for that, and am now actively taking to play dates with his peers to socialize more. He use to do a lot of hand leading, but generally points now. He mainly will grab my hand or butt to get me to stand up. He's always on the go and he doesn't like me to sit for long periods of time. He's a very picky eater, he's almost never willing to try something new unless we go to a restaurant. If we go out to eat he loves the atmosphere and will eat anything i put on front of him. We have a nighttime routine, but don't follow it strictly and if we change it he could care less. The only thing that's a must is his own bed he will not or can not sleep anywhere else. He's non aggressive he doesn't hurt himself or anyone else he loves hugs and kisses. He doesn't line up toys if anything it's the opposite he love messes. He will stack blocks just to knock them over. He's not sensitive to touch he actually craves it. Loud noises don't bother him. He has very few tantrums mostly communication based if i cant figure out what he's pointing to or what he wants. He gives me about a min to figure out what he wants. If i don't he gets upset for a minute or two before he clams down. He hit all his milestones on time other then speech. He had his initial visit with a developmental pediatrician last week( just met the nurse not the doctor) In that visit he tested normal but a high normal (all they did was ask me questions about his behavior) She suggested we go ahead with the 2 hour autism testing which is scheduled for this Thursday Aug 1st. She said based on our answers he is either not autistic, and just has quirky behaviors or has a mild case. He's apparently too young to be tested for ADD/ADHD. Which I'm leaning towards do to the family history. I don't want him medicated or anything, but an ADD/ADHD diagnoses might help when it comes to him learning, but at 2 I'm sure all toddlers have some form of ADD so i can understand why they don't test at his age.

 I'm super nervous about the autism testing. I was against any autism testing when it was first mentioned to me by ECI, because I feared he was too young to be possibly label with something that would effect his future. Ultimately I decided if he has it, I want him to have the extra advantage and services that he wouldn't get without the diagnosis. I'm defiantly going though the five stages of grief with this. My husband is supportive, but tells me to stop worrying and obsessing over it, but I can't!. Harrison's future is so unclear now. I don't know what to expect or how he's going to develop down the road. It feels good just to get this off my chest. I haven't told anyone in my family about the possibility of Harrison being autistic. Since they aren't familiar with autism I don't see the point of mentioning it without a firm diagnoses.

 Reading back though my wall of text here i can see I have an excuses for any behavior that might be considered autistic. Maybe I'm still in denial. Today I made a video of Harrison repeatedly responding to his name. In case during his evaluation he's distracted and doesn't respond I can prove that he can. I know autism isn't reversible, but I have worked so hard to help him. I feel like I tireless fighter for my son and will do anything to help him. I'm concerned this developmental pediatrician who has never met me or my son is going to spend 2 hours with him, and tell me he's autistic. I have been told not to worry that they see autistic children all the time and can easily spot it. Can someone please ease my mind here, am I stressing out to much and over concerned here.

He started again, he will go into my room, which he knows he isn't supposed to and steal food, money or whatever he wants.

Yesterday I found out about the money, I had suspected but no proof as he would take change. We talk to him about how it is wrong, he says how sorry he is, but will turn around and do it again. 

For the past week or two we will catch him up at 3am or 4am, in the laundry room (as that's where he can do it without being noticed) with a bag of Doritos, chocolate powder or whatever he can open. He eats enough and eats more than my husband and I do, and has a good diet considering his food intolerances. However I'm at my wits end.

424,Not yet diagnosed and not quite sure if I want to be...,"I'm 17 years old, always been a little strange, seen therapists for numerous things such as anxiety and different little ""quirks"" in my personality. Recently, my mum came out with saying that she thinks I may be ""just hitting the autism spectrum"" and asked me to do the online AQ test. As she suspected my score was a bit higher than the score achieved by those with autism or related disorders but I know it is not a diagnosis test. I do have many of the traits but they haven't got in the way of my development that I've noticed. Is it worth going to the docs and getting a proper diagnosis or would I be fine to just continue as I am? My issues are mostly the anxiety which I've been working on in CBT, so it hasn't been affecting me THAT much. My only worries of going to the doctors and being told that yes, I do have a mild form of autism is the negative connotations which go along with that (none of which I agree with at all) but I do think people will see me differently than before.

429,New to r/Autism - Book to Share,"Hi all, just discovered this thread, as I have been interested in autism because I have a nephew that was recently diagnosed with autism. Since his diagnosis I have been studying autism feverishly. I eventually came upon the controversial link between vaccines and autism. After reading through this subreddit a bit today, I was shocked to see that any mention of vaccines and autism is shot down, and no healthy discussion about the topic is encouraged. Even if there is ONE doctor in the world asking questions about the link between autism and vaccines, I would want to listen.

Anyways, I wanted to share a book I found on the subject, that has a large section devoted to autism and the potential connection with vaccines. The book is called [Vaccine Safety Manual for Concerned Families and Health Practitioners](http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Concerned-Families-Practitioners-Edition/dp/188121737X) by Neil Miller. This book is a great resource for parents, and has a whole section devoted to the Autism connection to vaccines. And no, it's not just the Wakefield study. (And Jenny McCarthy is an idiot and attention whore, so please don't bring her up). But there are MANY physicians who have suggested there may be a connection between autism and vaccines. We need to have intelligent, thoughtful discussion about this, and not just dismiss the idea without investigation.

* He won't eat any fruits/veggies

I'm a recent high school graduate and am going to be attending university next year. I'm participating in a 24-hour hackathon (coding contest) that challenges us to build something that can help the autistic community (or individuals with autism themselves). We can build something that would help with employment, communication, reflection, evaluation, etc. For us, we'd be most comfortable making a native application (like for Android phones or iPad or iPhone) or a simple little website. 

Feel free to drop an idea or two if possible on what you think we could build that's relatively simple but would help the autistic community in general.

440,Outperforming neurotypical individuals in social interaction with intentional interaction strategies,"My great passion is to both functionally and structurally understand and experience social dynamics. This, I believe, is unique amongst the autistic community where it commonly cited area of distress and hindrance.

I have a wealth of knowledge from obsessive and merciless experience collection and analysis, if you will, and immersion in the systems of others. I have done so naively, without methodological consistency.

I find myself significantly unfulfilled since I know feel overwhelmed by the choices with the ways I can approach social interaction. I am equipped with countless arms and don't know where to go from here, having 'suddenly' become aware of the exteneousness of simulatenous theoretically disharmonious systems which can't be 'falsified', since they do not apply everywhere, which I don't have the time to unify (the unification of psychology is no task for the next century, even), that I can't analyse at a statistical level relative to one another because it would be extremely slow - keeping me from exploring social nuances and having fun  not missing out on breaking new experiential ground, not to mention cognitively consuming to have to remember how everything goes.

I don't suppose one of my kinsmen can offer any insight from their expertise about where to go to from here?

There currently exists no scientific way of approaching social interaction. There are many ideas from as many people in the world, but i have manged to summarise their 'types' as such. so i ask you - which is a better strategy - to imagine what you would do in someone else's shoes, to pick up on a persons identifiers and stereotype expectations, to imitate roles ethnographically, to work on a minimalist baseline, to work within an established formal framework based on the insights of the clinical insights of a person with a huge following, or to incorporate a mishmash of experiments where the situation reminds you of the experimental situation",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1idjy3/outperforming_neurotypical_individuals_in_social/,331

443,Request for advice from a sibling,"To all whom these presents come, greeting:

*Before I get started, I'd like to let y'all know that in this post I express views which treat autism as a disease, focus almost exclusively on my experiences as a neurotypical person, dehumanizingly describe a person with autism as a burden, and negate his experiences and wants. I want my first act to be to apologize for holding these views, and to clarify that my purpose in this post is not to advocate for them, but to ask for help in confronting and changing them.*

My soon-to-be seventeen-year-old little brother is a low-functioning autistic. He is completely non-verbal, is not able to read or write, and does not communicate using PECS or any other system. I'm not sure whether the way I've described him here is accurate, as I'm not really clear on the terminology. But then, that's the problem.

I'm nineteen years old, and know next to nothing about my little brother. I've never really been involved in his schooling or worked with him at home, and now for most of the year I'm out-of-state at school. In the past, I've struggled with the idea that I might have to provide for my brother in the future. He's not completely toilet-trained yet, so (forgive me for saying this) I don't think a job or independent living is in the future for him. He's also over 6 feet tall and quite heavy for his age, and my (4'11"") mother isn't getting any younger. I can't discuss my worries or other feelings with her because every time I express any reluctance to support my brother, she (understandably) gets angry and tells me that I just don't love him enough. The problem is, I think that's true.

I don't love my brother. I'm angry at him for ruining our family, for sleeping in my parents' bed for the past 17 years, for being the reason we've never had a family vacation, and for, on top of that, expecting me, my parents, and my other brother to support him for the rest of our lives. Of course, I realize that I probably should have gotten all these problems sorted out a long time ago, but I've had no outlet. My parents have never sent me or my neurotypical brother to therapy, or explained to us what would happen if they died, or attended a support group as a family.

I don't know what to do. I feel lost and abandoned and scared. I should sympathize with the autism rights movement a lot — I'm gay, and I when I came out to my mother, she seemed so upset and treated me with such pity that I couldn't help but feel she thought I had some incurable disease. I see the parallels, and I feel like I should be able to sympathize with autistic people, but I just can't understand how y'all, who write books and invent things and support yourselves, are anything at all like my brother who shits in the bathtub, spits water into electrical sockets, walks around the house naked, and has never said my name.

I'm not sure what I'm expecting to get out of this post. I have a lot of problems, and advice would be appreciated on any of them, but I recognize that this post is mostly screaming (whining) into the void. Again, I want to emphasize that all the views I've described are horrible, and I feel like an awful hypocrite for feeling this way.

She tried community college but had great difficulties passing classes (namely Math) aside from music courses. She went on to nanny school and graduated from there, but the nanny school won't endorse her/give her a good recommendation as a nanny because she didn't successfully complete her practicum.

She's great with kids and people in general, and she's got an aptitude for singing and playing the piano (she's been taking lessons for years). I can understand disability assistance as a sort of supplement while she's looking for work, but I really believe she's capable of earning a living and contributing to society in some way. You wouldn't even know she had learning disabilities just by talking to her, it only really shows up if you're in a class together, or if she's presented with some sort of high-pressure/overwhelming situation.

447,Can anyone relate to this? Two year old son,"This is really long I'm sorry. But anything would really be appreciated i don't have anyone to talk to. My amazing son is 22 months old. When I brought up my concerns of autism at the 18 month checkup my doctor said not to worry and well talk about it at 2. 
That's two months away and I'm scared. 

Around 14 months my son was saying 
Mama dada bye bye and night night 
Then he broke his leg and he stopped. 

He is now 22 months and says a lot of da da but its more like babbles because its dadaa dadaaa dedeedee
But I don't want to hurt my husbands feelings. He says bye bye and night night but not on command just sometimes when can get him to say byebye and blow a kiss. 

He slaps him self in the head and face. He runs into the wall and bangs his head on purpose or hits it on the floor and furniture when he's upset. 

He spins. It's weird though, he does it on his own and we can say Charlie do spinner and he spins and his eyes look the direction he was coming from not the way he is going. He does it until he's so dizzy he falls then gets up and does it again. He isn't laughing he doesn't think it's funny. He just does it. 

He's obsessed with Thomas the train and any sort of tractor. He's very specific about Thomas trains he doesn't like generic. Most of his train are magnetic and we have to hide the ones that aren't because he gets so frustrated when they don't stick to the rest of them. 
I thought when he lines up other thinks (not trains)he was making them like a train but it could be that he is lining things up 

I watch a boy his age, a three year old and my niece. He has not interest in playing with them. He just wants to play by himself. 

He's very texture oriented. He hate plush. If you try to put a plush blanket on him he cries and doesn't want his skin to touch it. He has a specific pillowcase he had to have his pillows to sleep. They're a cotton and satin blend. 

He hates the vacuum, the blow dryer, garbage disposal, electric mixer, and drill gun. But he doesn't mind loud tractors and trucks, although he used to.

He doesn't point or tell you what he wants. He'll get your hand and lead you to it. If you don't get up hell try to push you up. If he leads you to a door outside and you say no not right now he hits himself and bangs his head on the door while crying. 

He took all of the TV's out of the house because he would go into zombie mode and only want tv and would have meltdowns. He didn't understand regulating tv time. 

Things that make me think, no way, he's not autistic is he will give hugs ( basically he pits his head on you and lets you hug him) and kisses 30% of the time you ask. 
He's obedient. When I say turn around he does and comes back to you. If I say take it to daddy, he will. Or bring me a book, or lets get in bubbles he goes to the bathroom. 
He does fine in Walmart, and out to eat. I never have to worry about taking him in public. 
He will make eye contact and smile back. 
He responds to his name 50% of the time. 
He is a relatively easy toddler if you know him. But I can see how he might be harder to babysit. But I stay home with him and my mom and sister are the only people who've ever watched him and they know him 

So after all of that, should I push my pediatrician or are those things normal, and the positives disprove an autism diagnosis?

He had no interaction with kids and was also leading instead of talking. I got some really good advice and pm from a lot of people and also started praying a lot. 

It turns out that I got help had he Is under going behavioral and speech therapy and has done a 360 !! 

He now has a lot of eye contact and is beginning to respond to his name. He is interacting with more children now . The therapist taught us techniques to avoid the leading and he is coming along nicely .. It might have been that he was speech delayed and that made it appear he was on the spectrum but he is advancing very nicely . I think one of the mistakes we did was not interact up close with him more. He is very babied. And he is also not around a lot of social interaction ,which we have begun to do . 

He speach is also progressing as well. My heart goes out to anyone dealing with a similar situation or has children with autism ..

I've gathered not to pay attention to autismspeaks but that's about it.

What books should I be reading? What books should I buy him? What websites should I visit?

It seems like other parents are experts and I'm just flying by the seat of my pants. I love my boy and nothing has changed in regards to how I view him, but now I'm overwhelmed with anxiety, even guilt, about letting him down or failing him some how because of **my** short comings.

The only successful thing I feel I've done on my own for him, is put up a shelf in his room. I noticed that the way he lined up his favorite toys (on our counters, desk, entertainment center) seemed to be for a display type value so he could organize &amp; admire them. He loves the shelf so much. He's such a happy little dude.

Any way. I am seeking any and all advice there is to get.

Venting, as well. Speaking of which - do support groups exist for parents with autistic children?

452,I need help winning over the girl of my dreams who is on the spectrum,"Ok, so it's kind of a long story.  I'm just starting to realize how much I really care about this girl and I want to know her on a more personal level.  I've done an obsessive amount of research on Autism and Aspergers and I know we are both on the spectrum.  

We met 6 months ago in a dual diagnosis treatment center for drug abuse and mental disorders.  I have sever depression and anxiety which I would mask with alcohol and pain killers.  She has anxiety, depression and diagnosed ADHD and her drug of choice is adderall and alcohol.  We were both very quiet and introverted when we first arrived at the treatment center in Florida.  I thought she was very pretty when I saw her for the first time.  She was very quiet but not exactly shy.  It was as if she had so many thoughts running through her head but could not express any of them.  Whenever it was her turn to speak she would say ""I don't know"" 99% of the time.  She was present and paying attention the whole time but, thought she would be judged for saying something stupid.  She was always very selective with who she expressed herself around.  I could see bits of her comfortable self show when she talked with certain people and eventually when she talked with me further down the road.  

A lot of the guys I know from here have tried making moves on her but, she always rejects them.  She always hangs out with the less attractive girls that none of the guys really try to ""get with"".  She is very shy whenever the topic being discussed is about sexual matters.

She has really began becoming comfortable with being herself around other people.  She is sharing more in groups and becoming less socially awkward.  She is moving more towards a not really giving a fuck attitude about what other people think of her and it is very attractive. I'm pretty sure she likes me but, being on the spectrum myself I can be very oblivious towards what other people are feeling.  A few months back she really wanted me to go shopping with her and just push the cart while she picked out her groceries.  She was really excited that I did it and kept asking me if it was weird that she wanted me to do that.  We have teased and flirted with each other a lot in the past month or so.  Her, myself and another guy we live with went in for an interview at a treatment center for us to work at(the treatment center we live in provides training to work as behavior health technicians in other treatment centers).  She exclusively wore hoodie sweaters for the first 5 and a half months she was down here(I'm talkin like, I saw her not wear a sweater one time before recently and I have seen her everyday for the past 5 and a half months here in Florida).  At the interview she was wearing one of the other girl's outfits and I had never seen her like that before.  It really made me notice how beautiful she really is.  She was very confidant and sexy.  She came over to my house after the interview and it was just me and her.  I feel like I could have made a move and that she was even waiting for it but, I was too afraid.  I'm still very scared to get close to anyone after my first girlfriend toyed with my heart and crushed it in the end.  After she left I tried not to think about it too much and tell myself I really didn't care that much.  The next night was 4th of July and after thinking over everything, I decided I was going to ask her out during the fireworks.  I pulled her aside during the show and asked her if she would go out with me and that I really liked her.  She seemed surprised when I said I really liked her but also that she didn't want to and that the last time she got into a relationship she went crazy.  She was really uncomfortable and wanted to go back to her girlfriends so we just went back and watched the rest of the fireworks.

We havn't spoke since and I don't know the best way to approach the situation.  I really like her and that entire story about her that I just described is pretty much a mirror discription of myself since coming to Florida.  It's eerily similar, I kinda feel like I'm falling for a female version of me... addicts tend to have big egos so I guess it kinda makes sense.

I would love to hear some feedback from any women who feel like they can relate to her.  How would you want the situation to progress if you were her?  Do Aspie girls even find Aspie guys sexually attractive generally?  

I was thinking about writing her a letter telling her how I feel.  I don't want it to come off as like, a love letter, although I suppose that's what it would be.  Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated.

455,Anyone here have experience with getting SSI for their autistic child? I need help with his claim.,"I have no idea where to post this but was hoping other parents with autistic children might be able to help.

Some back story first. My son is now 15 but was once eligible when he was 3. I was married but both incomes were low enough. My then husband got a raise in pay that made my son ineligible. When I went through this process the first time it was simple and easy. Paper work, a few phone calls and mailing in pay stubs. No internet or email. 

Now that I'm divorced my son is eligible again. I made the first phone call in February and its been hell ever since. The person handling the case has stated that she has mailed out letters and made phone calls to me that I never received. When I am able to get a hold of her she keeps saying that there is a chance that it will be denied because it has taken so long. I hand delivered the pay stubs but when I called for an update the representative over the phone says they haven't been put into the system. 

I've left out a lot of detail so the post doesn't turn out so long but basically the person that is handling the claim is incompetent. The first time I went through this it was so easy. You would think that email and the internet would have improved things. Does anyone here have experience with SSI? Has anyone here had to speak to a supervisor at the social security office? I feel if I complain, I'll just get denied. Is there any website or message board that I can go to for help or advice? What can I do or say that will get the ball rolling? 

Any advice would be great. Thanks

Edit update: I called in again this morning. One rep said there was an issue with my pay stubs and she said my case worker would call me back today. From past experience I knew I wouldn't get a phone call at all so I called back to her direct line. 

She insisted she didn't have 3 pay stubs and I had to say three times that I put them in the drop box. Finally she looked in someone else's mail box and they magically appeared. I sat with her over the phone as she calculated my son's payments. His claim is now complete and I should be receiving payments for March April May and part of June but I can't remember why she said June's payment will be short. If past experience proves correct, I doubt that she turns the case in and I will most likely need to call back if the direct deposit doesn't come through with in a week. 

Tl;dr I might have gotten things going with persistent phone calls but remain sceptical and will keep up the pressure on them. No one will fight for our kids but us. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1ht3qj/anyone_here_have_experience_with_getting_ssi_for/,208

458,Mind mapping software for use in teaching?,"Hi all! I just started working with an 11 yo HFA kid who I'll be doing a lot of emotional/socialization work and started experimenting with building an interactive curriculum for him using mind maps. The software I'm settling on is http://www.mindmaple.com/ which has a really nice GUI for building with lots of options for incorporating images and hyperlinking to websites as well as to other mind maps.   
  
I was curious if anyone here has used mind maps at all for this and if so what software did you use, as well as how successful it may have been. I also really like Mindmaple for the fact that I can use it on my iPad when working with the kid as well as the fact that I can put it on his computer for when I'm not with him.   
  
An example would be that we can look at mom's emotions. The map will have photos of her face as well as any relevant body language to help identify the emotion. Then I will tag on child options (child being a sub-choice that stems from the emotion) like ""why does mom feel this way?"" or an ""appropriate responses"" as well as any other relevant issues to be addressed for that emotion.  
  
What I'd like to do is build templates of these mind maps to share with everyone so that we can drop in specific images or hyperlinks that we're working with. I'll post what I get done this weekend as my rough draft, but I'll be looking to collaborate with anyone who might be interested. I also teach subjects in homeschool with a lower functioning kid who might also enjoy learning subject matter in this manner, linking to online videos and interactive elements online while presenting key points and limited descriptions in the map.
  
Sorry for the long post.

TLDR I'm looking to use mind mapping software to create interactive educational templates. Any experience with or interest in collaborating?

462,Help - Maybe broken finger - What to do?,"So one of my boys who is on the autism spectrum may have broken the tip of his finger.  He likes to slam doors/drawers and may have pinched his finger in it.  We noticed it was swollen last night, and my wife took him to the doctor today to get it checked out.

They did an X-ray and saw a VERY faint line on the very tip of his finger.  They aren't even sure it's broken, and admitted it could just be that he was wiggling during the X-ray, could be a skin fold, a line in his fingernail, etc.

He is non-verbal (4-and-a-half years old), and very sensory sensitive.  He doesn't like wearing clothes, but tolerates it for the most part..picks at his fingers, etc.  They tried wrapping his finger with tape but he immediately took it off.  They said the only real option is to put a cast on it for a week to keep him from breaking it worse, but said the chances were slim that would actually happen.

My worry is that he is fairly physical when he's mad (slams things, bangs his head, throws himself on the floor) and a cast is going to PISS him off..possibly setting him off to bang the hand on something and make it worse in spite of the cast, or possibly injuring himself in other manners.

I'm hesitant to do the cast as the negatives far outweigh the positives, especially when they aren't even sure it's a break for sure.  We figure we would just keep an eye on him, keep him from slamming doors/drawers for a while, and ice the finger at night when he's sleepy and calm-ish, and see how that goes.

Any opinions/experience?  Thanks in advance...

Edit:  Thanks for all the great advice.  We'll be forgoing the cast and just keep an eye on him and the finger to make sure it doesn't get worse.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1hiz8c/help_maybe_broken_finger_what_to_do/,347

They are young and now sharing responsibility of my nephew. While my brother has him, I watch him while he is at work. A little background, I have education in early childhood development and three kids of my own.
   I believe my nephew has autism. He is a month away from three years old and says only 3 words. Makes no eye contact. REFUSES any food besides Pediasure. Cannot drink from a cup. Does not play with toys, instead he categorizes them buy size and color. Does not play with his cousins. Does not like affection and does not respond to his name. 
   Now my brother sees that there is something wrong here, but he is a bit of a non-confrotatonalist. His mother on the other hand refuses to get him evaluated. She says he is going to grow out of it. And thats that. I fear that by the time she HAS to accept it, it will be too far gone.

like

Dog -&gt; Dogf

or more recently

Dog -&gt; Dogp.

Also, things like

Brain Fart -&gt; Brainf Art

or even more cumbersome ones, I'll still sound them out in my head like

Dog Park -&gt; Dogp Ark

or things (this is one that people do for fun)

Dog Park -&gt; Pog Dark

I also try to compress words.  Some people (often southern people or old people) say restaurant (rest er awnt) as res *trunt*, or fire man to firemuhn.  Well I try to do that with lots of words and phrases.  Like

Price per gallon -&gt; pry *sperga* l'n

or

Sugar coma -&gt; sha *gerka* muh

And I do these things automatically.  It's not a conscious effort.  When I hear words and phrases my mind just processes them in these ways because it's such a habit.  I do it so much that I have several friends from entirely different friend groups who I've dragged along into doing it habitually themselves, at least out loud.

Some other relevant things... I would make up non-sense languages until I was around 6.  I also have aversions to some words and go well out of my way to avoid using them.  People joke about the word ""moist"" being the worst word--well, I have a whole list of them.  I also tend to notice trends in language.  I'll notice certain phrases that seem to suddenly come up a lot and I will obsessively search the internet looking for other people who have observed the strange trends, because I get satisfaction from finding someone else who notices these things, because it confirms my suspicions and I get frustrated when I point it out to people and they don't know what I'm talking about.  Also I'm very careful about not overusing words in papers that I write--I will ctrl+f and look at how frequently I use ""However"" at the beginning of a sentence, for example.

471,I need a new doctor,"So my 9 year old autistic son has seen quack after quack. He is developing slowly but is still non conversational and his behavior (and lack of conversing) makes him completely not mainstream material now (hopefully one day). We have seen the run of quacks over the years. As a matter of fact, they all seem to be quacks. And they were all celebrity docs in the autism world. We saw Arthur Krigsman (Andrew Wakefield's partner in Texas) and of course got a diagnosis of ""Autistic Enterocolitis"" which every one of his patients gets. We saw a guy in pennsylvania who was doing blood ozonation (I stopped that one). We saw a guy in Miami Beach who was big into HBOT (I had an HBOT in the house for 6 months, sold it eventually). We've done everything. Diets, methylcobalamin, enzymes, crazy vitamins, antifungals, you name it. I know that some people disagree with the pursuit of a biological solution to autism. Rest assured, along the way my son is getting an appropriate special needs education as well. 

Our current doctor is finally the one who seemed to show the most promise. His prevailing theory is the CNS herpes virus theory and my son has been on a multitude of antivirals. Along with that he has been on different SSRIs as well. But some things about this doc have surfaced recently which make me think twice about continuing. My son has progressed on this regimen for the past 18 months but it's hard to delineate what is from treatment and what is natural progression. 

His current doc has really started to become a bit odd. We have phone consultations with him where he goes off on crazy tangents where he believes that Monsanto is in collaboration with the government to control the public's minds with GMO's. And he believes that the genes Monsanto has inserted into the corn and soybeans we eat will eventually become incorporated into our genome. He believes that humans will start to make the pesticide BT in our bodies. (My wife refuses to let me argue with him so I bite my tongue). I'm really starting to doubt any reasonable scientific thought goes into his treatment regimen. 

I'd really love to continue to pursue a biological angle to treating my son. But every single doctor who has some biological treatment ends up being a total whack a doodle. Are there any physicians out there who treat autism as an actual medical disease with real medicine who fulfills the concepts of the scientific principle? I guess with any disease that mainstream medicine has all but abandoned, it leaves a lot of room for the quacks.

He constantly has that blank, vacant look in his eyes, when before it was hardly there. He doesn't respond to us any more, he is starting to throw more and more tantrums, and if he's not stuck in front of a screen (his ipad, or a movie) he is freaking out. 

I live in Austin and have been looking around at different organizations, emailing and calling. I also joined mettup to try to find groups that have autistic kids, all with hardly any luck. I'm at my end, and I don't know what to do anymore. 

He isn't in therapy right now since they just recently moved. That is being worked out currently.

477,Running out of ideas for work... help me be creative!,"I work with autistic kids and right now I have 3 boys that I see 4 days a week, and I feel like I'm getting boring with them.
Now that it's nice out, we can do things like go to the park or ride bikes or play with chalk, but we have specific goals to work on with each child and it feels counterproductive to be doing the same exact thing every day to help get these goals secured.

I used to have such a huge imagination...I was the most creative little kid...now I'm sitting around thinking about things I can do for work and coming up short. I don't know if it's the pressure or what.

Not to mention when I go shopping, I always end up looking at the toys and crafts and thinking ""Oh perfect, they would love this!"" but as I am broke, I can't just keep buying stuff for the kids. 

So... I guess any suggestions would be wonderful.

All three kids are high functioning, and two are brothers. The brothers love cars, pirates, superheroes and are very defiant. The other boy loves trucks and tractors - basically any large vehicle. He enjoys baking and just making things in general, and is very open to playing with things that kids might deem ""girly"" (i.e. his sister's Barbies, MLP, LPS).",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1h5oth/running_out_of_ideas_for_work_help_me_be_creative/,360
478,I think my brother might have autism,"I originally posted this in in /r/relationships and someone mentioned this subreddit so I am cross-posting here. I don't know if anything I wrote is offensive so if it is please let me know and I'll take it out or remove the whole post.

----

My brother and I have never been that close and he had a lot of social problems growing up. As adults (in our 30s) we live pretty far away from each other and don't talk often. I've always felt pretty uncomfortable about our relationship because while he's nice enough, he's just really weird and I don't like hanging out with him. I guess that is kind of a mean thing to say about family but it's the truth.

It only recently dawned on me (while watching a ted talk) that there might actually be something wrong with (maybe that's not the right word, just different?) him. I've never been able to put my finger on why I don't like hanging out with him, it just seems like it's a bunch of little things. He has a really loud, shrieking laugh and will laugh like that at things that aren't very funny, he never gets the ""rhythm"" of conversation right, he often references things that people have no way of knowing what he's talking about, instead of making eye contact he'll just STARE at you, he'll start talking about stuff that is way too personal with total strangers, that kind of thing. He has never had a romantic relationship that I know of.

I was thinking that if in 30 years this was the first time it crossed my mind, maybe he's never considered it either, and it might be a big help to him to get a diagnosis and get some kind of therapy. But I don't know if there's anything that can be done for this kind of thing, so maybe bringing it up would be pointless? I also think he might kind of take it as an insult, as he has always seemed kind of in denial about the fact that he's socially abnormal.

The last question I have is pretty selfish, but I was wondering if anyone knew about any resources for ways that I could deal with him better. Like I said, it causes me a LOT of guilt that I don't have a good relationship with him, and I keep coming up with excuses for reasons he can't come visit me because I get so stressed out trying to hang out with him. So assuming I'm right, and he does have some kind of autism, is there some kind of resource for families of autistic people to help us deal with them?

Thanks for your help.

tl;dr: I think my adult brother might be autistic and not know it, wondering if a) he is b) I should say something c) there's anything I can do to make hanging out with him easier on me.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1h2oy9/i_think_my_brother_might_have_autism/,361

481,A living nightmare,"My wife has a friend whose child is a non verbal autistic girl and she is mean! With my wife being the loving creature she is, she shows sympathy for the child and I do not. She has tried to educate me with what she knows; like what stimming is, and anout the child's therapies, but I feel her family gives little care for her and her mother whether or not she wants to admit it really dislikes the child. Her frustration and anger are evident at times. I have no empathy for the mother! Everytime I've visited their home the child has the tv remote and flips through channels or is playing on a phone, ipad, computer. She does therapy throughout the week, but has little interaction from her parents from what ive witnessed. They always allow her to do as she pleases for the most part. However, the child is mean! She hits people, kicks, screams in your ear and I don't like being around her. When I come home and my wife has them over I immediately leave. The child has broken more furniture in my house than my own kids- she eats my books, after tearing them all off of the shelves, destroys my child's playroom, hits my children, all the while running and spinning, screaming, jumping, following my kids around and trying to push them off of the couch/chair and taking over the tv. She is a terror- my children don't like her.I know she is non-verbal and unable tk help her disability, but this is a little overkill. My wife rarely says anything about the behavior while they are there and promptly cleans up when they leave, but I know she dislikes it. She tries not to visit their house often because the child is so mean, but she wouldn't dare say it. The child is 7 years old, has never spoken one word in her life, refuses to sign, and her parents think one day this will just all go away. Is it just me or am I being to judgemental. This child needs more help, probably medications, and behavior therapy. I don't dislike the child - I dislike her lack of will to behave. Is this common for autisic children? I have seen others who were not this mean. 

Tl;dr my wifes friend has a child who is nonverbal, autistic, constantly stims by jumping and yelling and is mean as hell. Is this the norm?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1gza34/a_living_nightmare/,363
482,"My apologies, I imagine this subreddit gets this kind of post often.","This is going to be a long one. I was babysitting my niece(11), and her friend came over. Her friend being the same age. A pretty, exceptionally tall, healthy looking 11 year old girl. She immediately retreats to my nieces bedroom, my niece following. The mother of my niece's friend approaches me, and starts to strike up a conversation. Through the small talk, comes her point she was trying to make(I imagine) which was that she was extremely proud of her daughter, because this is her first friend that she has ever had, and bringing her to the house is the only way to get her out of her room. She went on to tell me about her daughters ""struggle"" with autism.(Although, it sounded more like a mothers anguish that her daughters different, to be honest) Shes been diagnosed. Doing CBT, regular therapy, etc. She just was asking me to keep a closer eye on her and gave me her number, pleading me to call her if ANYTHING goes wrong. I oblige, she leaves, I start googling, lol. I start reading about Autism, and the different spots on the spectrum, and such. So many of the symptoms sounded frustratingly similar. So I google further. Stumble upon the 50 question test, that I guess some specialists use as a starting point, so I figured why not. Scored a decently high number(34) although its not alarmingly high, I've come here to ask if this is really enough for me to go to my psychiatrist, and ask her what she thinks.(Our sessions are only 15 minutes, usually just a check up on my medication, and dosage adjusting, asks me about my week, and I'm off) So I just want to know if this is truly enough to start. As a child(1st-4th grade, not during developmental stages, I developed quickly, teaching myself to read in pre-school) my teachers from kindergarten+1st grade approached my parents at some point, telling them that they think I may be autistic, and can start meeting with the social worker. My parents, caring about me, did so. I remember the sessions very vaguely. But my first memory of anxiety was my first meeting with her. Completely shutting down, not speaking a word, staring at my feet. She would keep asking me questions. I would leave after a little bit, and they'd try again. I became slightly comfortable with her, we spoke. This never really went anywhere. I ask my parents of it, and they don't say much. I changed schools and went on with life. The reason I'm here, asking, is there are some parts that don't check out with me. I still am withdrawn socially, but I have friends. In fact, I was fairly popular in high school, and am popular amongst my peers in college. I'm not close with any of them, though. I suppose I should mention that I am also fairly popular with women, and have had my fair share of good times with them and a couple girlfriends. The re-occuring problem with all of my close relationships is being obsessive(sometimes with the female) but emotionally withdrawn. Anybody whom of which is close to me, I know how to react to them when they're sad, or happy, etc. But when it comes to anything in between those emotions, it is beyond my mind. Another thing for me is I never cry. Even when sad and/or overwhelmed. No crying. I just shut down, retreat to my room, and write or read. Going to a different world. When people cry around me, I get extremely uncomfortable, because it seems to me that they can display/feel an emotional extreme I can't, and I don't know how to react to it, at all. So I ignore it. These are just a few examples, I suppose. I am infamous for remembering everybody who I come in contact with's birthday. I love numbers. I love patterns. I love number patterns. My passwords have been my own take on the Fibonacci Sequence since I was 15. I have always been (even through highschool) very socially withdrawn. I would always blow off my friends to stay in my room and play the MMO that I would be obsessed with at the time. Alright, well this has gone on long enough. I'm not asking for a diagnosis. I'm just asking for perhaps some insight/input from someone close to someone with autism, or someone with autism before talking to a professional, who only knows textbooks and patients. It'd just be nice to hear what you guys have to say. I apologize if this gets posted here a lot. Any positive response is welcome and highly appreciated.

483,i'm an autistic director making a movie about MS/disability and need your help!,"My name is Noelani Mei Lee. I am an autistic twenty-year-old indie film writer/director from Austin, TX and I have just posted a new kickstarter for my first feature film, ""SLEIGHT"" (www.facebook.com/sleightfilm, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2728986/combined)
Sleight was shot in its entirety last year and has since been about 50% completed in post so we are trying to raise $5,000 to finish all of post-production and distribute to film festivals.
This film centers around a man named Dennis Clemens who is diagnosed with a neurological disorder called Multiple Sclerosis. It affects him in every aspect of his life--his job, his money, his friends, right down to the core of his happiness.
He is forced to struggle this way his entire life and must find a way to accept who he is, disability and all, and be happy despite what he is handed. The friendships he encounters along the way push him along and through his disease, he learns more about himself than he ever thought possible.
A teaser for the movie can be watched here: https://vimeo.com/66934659
And the Kickstarter can be found here: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noelanimeilee/sleight
This film is not about finding a cure and it isn't about magically overcoming disabilities, because that is not realistic. It's about learning to live with them and discovering ways to take control of your life without letting a disease take control of you.
Please take a moment to check out this project--spread the word, donate if you can and keep it mind. Soon, this movie (with yours' and others' help) will be complete and hopefully will open many eyes to the lives those of us with disabilities, visible and invisible, live every day.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1gv067/im_an_autistic_director_making_a_movie_about/,365

487,Dog -- A short story about working with a 21 year old girl with autism. [x-post write],"*I apologize if this is out of place, but I wanted to share my experiences and feelings where they might be understood*

Alex is a thing of beauty, akin to a hummingbird or another small, delicate creature that you might admire from a distance with that chest-swelling feeling of awe for being lucky enough to have the opportunity to be in its presence, so fragile that you can hardly comprehend how its skeleton holds. I was pulled away from Sedaris to return to my post, a sentry seated next to her tiny body, curled up on a love seat and wrapped in blankets with only her face peering out just so, dimly illuminated by the glow of the television. I bristle when I hear her moan and whimper in her dreams, wishing I could defeat the demons in her mind and bridge the split between our worlds, make sense of the sensory chaos, but I cannot. 

So I position myself now on the couch beside her, her feet spilling over her sofa into mine, her audible breathing a steady beat that quells the demons in my own mind, only to be stirred again when her sharp exhales raise the hair on the back of my neck.

Tomorrow morning, I will wake her up for 8am meds and she will nod at me, maybe take my hand or if I am lucky, she will hug me, but beyond this, my words may as well be a dog's bark echoing in the distance, indiscernible and fading.

For now, I will continue watching the rises and falls of her breathing through the waves of blankets and like a dog, will wait by her side should she wake, squeeze her hands, and whisper nonsense that we both might understand, both trying with our entire bodies to communicate the simple transaction that needs desperately to end with the words, or rather the feeling, of safety.

I'm just curious if anyone who has Autism or someone they know with ASD has had any success with dietary changes?  For instance, gluten free diet.

Things that would be helpful to know would be:
- Age of person who started the diet?
- What diet was it (gluten free, casein free, etc)?
- How did you come about choosing to start or stop this diet?
- How long was the person on the diet?
- Your experiences with this or other diets?
- Was it expensive?
- Anything else.

492,it only ever gets worse,"i am tired as fuck.  

every day, it gets harder and harder to sleep at night and wake up in the morning.  every expenditure of self control seems to diminish my capacity for it.  

as i am forced to expend more of my time and energy just to remain functional i have less and less for everything else in my life, like pursuing goals, staying on top of my personal affairs, keeping my apartment clean, and trying to maintain some semblance of a social life.  

my life contracts further and further into a cycle of dragging myself out of bed late for work, working (as well as i can under the circumstances), coming home, eating, and trying desperately to sleep so I can do it again the next day.  

months go by as I grow less and less able to do even these things, feeling shittier and shittier all the while.  

i always tell myself that on weekends i'll use the time to get back on top of my life, but am compelled increasingly toward activities that serve only to distract me from the pain of being conscious.  

i have better days and worse days, better weeks and worse weeks, but the general trend is toward loss of my ability to function, loss of contact with other people, loss of control over anything in my life, and increasing misery.  

i hate my job, not because i don't like the work, but because it grows continually harder for me to even show up and do it.  i live in fear of getting fired again, because i doubt i'd be able to get another job before my savings run out, if ever.  

i have no friends, haven't had sex in several months, haven't had sex with someone i've actually been attracted to in several years.  i ache for human contact but find myself increasingly unable to connect with other people or even tolerate their company.

I talk to my child all the time about the new baby and we read books about the topic, although getting her to pay attention to books is very difficult (but I keep on trying). But I still feel like the idea hasn't ""clicked"" with her yet. For better or worse she does very well learning from videos. I watch them with her and explain what is going on and talk about the subject matter immediately after. She often seems engaged when we take this learning approach. Even some of her therapists have noticed how effective this is and will often start a session with a brief video of the topics we will be learning about on a particular day.

495,Autism and gastrointestinal issues. It's 3:23AM and my tummy hurts...again. :( [warning: potential TMI],"Okay, so my entire life, since childhood, I have been waking up in the middle of the night with the overwhelming urge to vomit. I used to think this was just because I got overheated in my sleep - I live in the South and it gets extremely hot in the summer, when this phenomenon seems to worsen for some reason. I started sleeping naked under a fan with just very light sheets to try and combat this overheating, and it seems to help. 

But all since yesterday I've had diarrhea - very dark stool, completely liquid - and I woke up at about 2:45AM *extremely* nauseous. I took a few swallows of the Coke on my nightstand (in retrospect, a pretty shitty idea, but swallowing a liquid usually calms overstimulation, and I had a bad nightmare, so I thought maybe it was related) and got up to get a glass of iced water and crunch three Rolaids. Didn't work. I ended up projectile vomiting up my supper in the bathroom. I did eat Mexi-Melts from Taco Bell for lunch, and that is probably a contributor to the sour stomach, but for supper all I had was a few bites of Hamburger Helper stroganoff, one of the blandest things we make. 

The diarrhea thing is pretty normal for me, though not constant. I usually just ignore it. But I'm starting to get worried that both it and the bouts of midnight vomiting are related to my autism, because up until recently (reading the Spourdalakis case) I didn't know there was even a correlation between gastrointestinal issues and autism. I'm also pretty sleep disordered and often wake up in the middle of the night anyway, I just occasionally wake up with this overwhelming urge to throw up. It's accompanied by all-body shaking/shivering, stomach pains, and a just general shitty feeling. 

I know nobody here is a doctor, but can anybody give me some insight into this? Do I need to switch diets? Is it overexcitability? I have a job interview this morning at 10AM and I'm a bit nervous - stimmed a *lot* worse than normal when I had to go out earlier yesterday to meet with a lawyer - but overall I feel no more nervous than usual. 

Before anyone chimes in with, ""You need to see a doctor to confirm,"" don't worry - I intend to. It's just that I don't *any* have health insurance right now (unemployed) and I thought I'd try to listen to some voices of experience for alternative methods of mitigating the problem before spending money that I don't have. 

Note: I was also reading a horror novel before I went to sleep and was having terrible dreams before I woke up nauseous, but since I don't always remember my dreams when I wake up (I usually don't, actually) I don't know if bad dreams are a constant factor or not. Also, once my phrenic nerve pathways are excited, I don't just evacuate my stomach and feel better, like most people do - I *keep* throwing up, until I have nothing left but yellow bile (*yuck*). It's like the sensations involved with vomiting throw me into sensory overload and cause me to do it compulsively over and over and over again. It fucking sucks.

Note 2: I also had a really bad meltdown yesterday, due to a fight between my brother and his wife that came to blows. I was caught in the middle, and there was a lot of screaming and whatnot that caused me to have a total emotional collapse. Rocking/regression/catatonic fix/breath holding spell/low silent hysterics. Could this be related to the systemic aftermath of that? 

All hypotheses welcome, because I'm tired of this crap.

497,Advice for Potty Training?,"So, my son is on the spectrum and is 3 and 1/2 years old. We have been having problems with him playing with his poop during nap time and at night. We found a way to stop him from playing with it (finally), but we want to begin him on potty training so we don't have to go through so much to stop him. The main issue with getting him started is he is non verbal. Any tips, advice, etc would be so helpful. We are so very lost going into this, as he's our first child. Is he too young to start? Where do we even begin? Thank you in advance

I feel betrayed and unable to trust him, especially due to the fact that he showed no remorse. The only reason he admitted it at all was because he thought we would find it funny. How can my family move forward when we don't feel comfortable having him around or even speaking to him? Are we expected to forgive and forget?

499,"Advice needed please: legal ""caretaker"" status available for spouse of high-functioning autistic due to job requirements?","Hi! I have high-functioning autism/Asperger's on the spectrum and work successfully in the technology industry. It plays well to my strengths and I telecommute because being in a normal office is wayyyy too distracting for me.

Recently, the office requested that I fly down to meet everyone and do in-person work. That has its own sense of social anxiety issues — I like my colleagues but I'm likely to be overwhelmed. But what I am wondering about is, when I reminded them (this has come up before) I am autistic and need my wife around at key moments like during the trip and getting checked in, they didn't seem that understanding/accommodating. Like they said they couldn't cover her plane ticket as well, despite it being a handicap for me. I can process info on a computer effectively but get embarrassingly lost in physical surroundings, among other issues.

I understand the company (as a private entity) sets some of their own rules but what I am trying to communicate diplomatically is that having my wife like a ""caretaker"" is pretty much essential to my daily functioning. I am not on the area of the spectrum where I can't manage my own financial decisions, for example, but I do have these issues.

I was doing research and the closest thing I could come up with is a ""guardian"" but that doesn't quite fit my specific situation.

Is anyone aware of some sort of status (here in the USA) I could apply to, in order to have these rights of mine legally recognized? So I have more clarity, whether it's in the workplace or elsewhere?

Thank you so much.

His SLP and Floortime instructor want to do some major intervention and completely restrict his time spent stimming.

502,Questions about the heritability of Autism.,"Hi /r/autism 
I've been googling, and found a bunch of scientific data about the heritability of autism, but much of the specifics went over my head. I'm hoping somebody with a better understanding could explain it to me like I'm 5.

How heritable is Autism? I'm not autistic. Although I have plenty of family history risk factors. Including a very eccentric grandfather who probably would have been diagnosed if he lived today. I get asked occasionally if I'm on the spectrum. It doesn't come up enough for me to pursue getting a diagnosis. Though the thought does cross my mind.

I've dated girls with autistic family members. But in the back of my mind was always concern over our future. Would it be moral for us to have children, if it dramatically increased the chances of low-functioning autism?

I have several of the characteristics and the description of autistic children sounds very much like me when I was young. My question is, is it common for people with high functioning autism to ""pass"" as neurotypical? I know that I come off as awkward/shy/eccentric but I don't think people look at me and automatically think anything.

506,"Parents, can I pick your brain for a few minutes?","My 2 year old is diagnosed with ASD.  I've received wonderful help here in the past and I have a few more questions.

My son is essentially non-verbal.  He's never had a regression per say, but he has a bank of words that come and go.  He'll say ""night-night"" for a few days, lose it.  Say ""uh oh"" or ""bye bye"" and lose those.  He's even said ""I love you"" and ""Who is this??"" a couple of times.  I've probably heard 25 words from him over the course of the past year.  

So I get the impression he will be verbal.  (And even if he isn't, that's okay.  However he wants to communicate is fine, I just want to help facilitate communication in some way.)  We've worked with a speech pathologist, but we've moved states and are in the process of getting him re-enrolled in all the services.

My question is this, why do the words come and go?  I know he is so capable, I just don't understand why nothing sticks.  I label everything.  I basically narrate everything we do together.  I try and coax words out of him when we take turns playing games.  He also knows the sign for more, but he only does it once in a blue moon.

Right now he communicates by bringing me things and taking me by the hand to things.  When he wants to go outside, he will take my hand and put it on the doorknob.

Also, this may or may not be related, but one of the really interesting things I notice in my son is that when he is introduced to a new toy or a new app on his iPad, he is super duper fascinated with it, masters it, and then wants absolutely nothing to do with it.  He seems to get bored with things so easily.  His problem solving skills, both mechanical and intellectual, seem pretty decent, if he's not frustrated.  If he's frustrated, forget about it.

Is there anything I can be doing on my end that can extend the longevity of toys or activities?  And is there anything I can be doing to foster language that will last, or is this something that's just going to happen as he grows older.

It's his little sister's princess bike, complete with the picnic basket, purple streamers, but zero fucks given. It annoys the wife that it's indoors, but you have to take what you can get sometimes.


He's five, starting summer kindergarden in a few weeks at the local public school. He's been in early childhood programs since being diagnosed at two.  


He's mostly nonverbal, but can utter a few single words when prompted. Has a few behavioral and meltdown problems, but that seems to come with the territory. It makes me very sad when he's next to NT kids at the playground or whatever, and I see the milestones others have reached. I believe he comprehends a fair amount of things going on around him. He is in speech and occupational therapy, and swim class once a week.

Mainly I fear he will never be able to express himself verbally, and depend on me until I die. As he's growing, I worry a lot about what will happen when he gets bigger and I can't pick him up anymore and leave when it's necessary. It's overwhelming to think how difficult it will be for him to learn to read.

512,"Autism! Don’t fear it, embrace it!","In the neurotypical world we tend to focus on the different as negative, rather than unique. We measure “goodness” by how it compares to the norm, and if it matches our view of value. If the qualities are “out of the norm”, than we immediately see the negative that blind us from the positive characteristics. We tend to interpret “different” as a weakness, or deficit, both something to change. We tend to interpret behavior that we do not understand as “bad”, not worthy, and needing to be suppressed. We do not look at differences as something that to value, understand, and marvel at. That differences may make our world better and enrich our lives. We are so conditioned to wanting to being “accepted” that appearing different is something to avoid. Unfortunately we block ourselves off from the true wonders that these differences may bring. 

Why is this? Why do we fear differences? Partly, I assume, is that the “unknown” scares us. We feel uncomfortable when things do not match what we are use to. How do you relate to it? How do understand it? Make it change, be like the norm, so I can feel comfortable with it! People have always been “uncomfortable”, even scared of things that are different. They are not as predictable. It doesn’t flow easily with how I regulate. It stands out as different, and will not be accepted! We become anxious; hyper-focused on the negative, and totally blind to the beauty that it may bring. It doesn’t fit our “common mode!”

I have been in the field for over thirty years. I have seen many individuals who are radically different in how they communicate, how they process information, what they attend to, and how they experience the world. I was a “behavior change agent” and employed to change these people; to make them “normal”, or at least appear normal. Like everyone else, these differences also scared me, especially since it was my job to suppress and change them. I started out in the back wards of an institution, where people with severe differences were secluded from the rest of the world. People who came from lives of abuse, torment, and despair at the hands of neglect and rejection. It was through their eyes that I learned that each had beauty, value, and worth. Values that we could not see, because we could not get past their differences. Once I stopped fearing the unknown, and embraced their uniqueness, did their differences start to appear, not as weaknesses, but as different perspectives; different ways of experiencing the world. Accepting these perspectives, allowed me to redefine them not as weaknesses, something to fear, but as strengths and gifts, that if supported, not only benefited their lives, but also enriched mine. 

I look around and still see our “fear” of that which is different, and our desire for it to “go away”. Whether embarrassed, or scared, we are definitely uncomfortable with differences, so we immediately interpreted them as bad and needing to be suppressed, or changed. We do more damage by wanting to change our children, then wanting to support them. “ If we make them “look” normal, then they will be happier, and so will we”. If it is not like us, then it is obvious unworthy. I beg you to resist this viewpoint, and try and redefine how you see things. Instead of immediately interpreting differences with a negative filter, try looking at them as potential positives; as different perspectives, that when supported, can be developed into strengths and gifts. Before suppressing the difference, observe and listen to it to understand it’s value. Look for positive value first, to redefine how you interpret it. My experience is that many of these differences are actually gifts that will enhance our own perspective of the world. Try to resist the urge to smother or change the difference because we simply don’t understand it. Try identifying the value in it, validating it, and fostering support for it. You will be surprised how the perceived “weed” can turn into a beautiful flower!

Your children come with a bundle of qualities. Many may look like ours, but many may not. Try to foster the children to develop all their qualities to see how they unfold. In my experience if we acknowledge, partner with, validate, and support the natural growth of these qualities, the children flourish, develop strong self esteems, and truly feel “safe, accepted, and competent.” Take their interests, regardless of how strange they initially appear, and try to view them from a positive perspective. What are they attracted to? What do they seek out? What do they initiate? What do they find pleasure in? Take their interests, and turn them into strengths. Start by assuming that these qualities are gifts and what strengths can occur from them. The children will not only feel accepted, supported and loved, but will also develop into more competent, self actualized human beings. In turn they may change your experiences, and possibly enrich your own perspectives . You will see the world totally different and be happier and more fulfilled as a parent, and as a person.

I love him to death, but he's driving me bonkers. He doesn't understand when he's hurting others, he doesn't remember any lessons he's learned through injury (like the stove is hot or falling down hurts). He breezes through child locks so we resort to more drastic measures- which he bypasses as well. Last night I'd locked myself in my bedroom while my husband watched him, but he ended up picking the lock with a popsicle stick. This morning he climbed over the partition we have blocking off the kitchen and climbed in the sink to play with the taps. I can't help but picture him toppling over and cracking his head open. Every knife, every dangerous chemical, every electrical outlet, water source, heat source, medication... it doesn't matter how securely locked up we think it is, he's a blink away. I'm a nervous wreck. 

That's to say nothing of the valuables and electronics.

516,My son is showing some characteristics of autism and I have a few questions.,"(TL;DR at the end) Last week I became aware of the fact that my son (5 years old today actually) may have ADHD, but he's too young for an official diagnosis. I have been paying close attention to the way he reacts to everything and today he did something pretty typical for him and I realized that it's likely he could have a mild form of autism. I'm going to make an appointment for him to be evaluated, but in the mean time, I'm hoping to put some of my fears at ease. 

First of all, what he did today that raised my curiosity was the way he reacted to a birthday present. It was a hat like Finn's from Adventure Time. He didn't want to wear it, he FREAKED out about it and didn't want anyone else to wear it. I messaged my therapist friend and asked why he would act this way and she said that it's a typical behavior in autistic children. They are hyper literal and focus on one thing and don't see the bigger picture. My son DEFINITELY does this. For example, sometimes I will say ""hold my fin hold my fin!"" like on Nemo and he gets SO mad because he doesn't have a fin, he has a hand. There are COUNTLESS examples of this that I kind of just ignored because I am so used to them. 

He never showed early signs of autism and he was evaluated when he was younger and nothing significant stood out so I know it's not severe, but I'm still a mom with an enormous amount of love for my son and I'm scared. I know I am only scared because I don't know what this means, what is going to happen, if we can afford proper treatment (just right now, I'm not worried about it for the future), etc. So here are my questions:

-I have always felt like he needs to be homeschooled. In general I love the idea of homeschooling, or more home education/unschooling. There are a lot of home school groups where I live and he will be able to have plenty of interaction with others. What are your thoughts on someone who has some autism? I'm not worried about it being frustrating for me. It is what it is. But hypothetically speaking, if we can do it the right way, do you think that would be beneficial? A big fear is that teachers will just get frustrated by him. This already happened to him in preschool.

-I know this sounds like a stupid question, but will he always have trouble functioning in society? Is this a life long battle? Or will he figure out how to cope well?

TL;DR-My son (5 years) is showing some characteristics of autism. While I'm waiting until he can have an evaluation, can you just tell me that if it is autism, everything is going to be ok?

At some point we will tell him he is autistic.  We want it to be our choice  and would like to wait a bit longer so he is better able to grasp it initially.  I'm concerned it's something that he would share with the other kids if given the opportunity.  It may not be obvious to everybody.

521,"Dear Shopper, Autism Spectrum Disorder, through my eyes.","&lt;not mine, just well written post from FB, and no links to FB, so just wanted to share&gt;
Autism Spectrum Disorder, through my eyes.
Dear Shopper,

Yes, I know. I’m well aware that my child is screaming. Not just a regular scream, but an ear-piercing, sanity-shattering screech. Even if I wasn’t seeing and hearing it, I would know by the expression on your face.

Clearly, you have raised your children better than me.

That is what you were wanting to say, right? There certainly can’t be any other purpose to you stopping in your tracks to stare or elbow your companion or better yet — give knowing looks to other shoppers passing by.

I have no doubt that you have wonderful, well-behaved children. Grown, tax-paying, law-abiding citizens who would never have dreamed of screaming like this in public when they were children. Judging by your expression and utter exasperation, you’ve never hesitated to let them know who was boss.

And I know that you did your best with your children, that you loved them, and want all children to have a solid upbringing in which to start their lives. You are, in all probability, a good person. You probably don’t mean any harm.

This is what complicates what I want to say to you. Because, despite my anger towards you, I happen to have been raised well too. I don’t want to be ugly, even though right now I feel like it.

Because I know some of that anger is misdirected. It is misdirected because I, too, have stood in judgment of someone like me. I, along with almost everyone, have stood in public and watched a scene like this one play out and thought to myself, “Clearly she has no control over her children. When I have children, mine will never behave like that.” I, like most people, wasn’t quite as obvious about it as you. I didn’t stare or make comments that could be heard. But I was every bit as decided. So, some of my anger is really directed toward Human Nature, who refuses to be put in its place.

The nice thing about human nature, however, is that it can be overridden. And all it takes is but a single experience, a single human interaction, to the contrary of your own strongly held convictions. Then presto whammo — you are a new and hopefully improved person.

Let me introduce you to my child. Like you, I marveled at the miracle of life upon becoming his mother. Like you, I rocked, burped, and inhaled his sweet baby scent and thanked God over and over for the gift of him. Like you, I had certain dreams for my child. There your path and my path diverged somewhat.

My precious child is autistic. Yes, I’ve seen Rain Man, and, no, my son is not likely going to be a great card counter. The truth about autism is that it encompasses a wide spectrum of abilities. And, like you and me, every autistic child who has it is different from the next. Yet they do often share some similar traits – sensory overload and meltdowns are one of them.

Every person on the planet has what I think of as an internal alarm system. Most of us have ours in good working order. But some people with autism have what I like to call a hair-trigger alarm system. Theirs can go off with what seems to average folks like little to no provocation. There IS always provocation. Non-autistic people simply aren’t as sensitive to seeing and hearing the triggers, and that’s when the alarm goes off. And when it does, it’s loud. Everyone in the vicinity wants nothing more than to have it turned off, including the people who love them. When you see me “placating” my child and “giving in” to his tantrum, I’m really just desperately looking around for the alarm key or trying to remember the right code to turn off that blaring alarm. It isn’t his fault. And, no matter how upsetting it is for you, let me assure you it is that much more upsetting for him.

I’m sorry that you haven’t had quite as pleasant of a shopping trip as you had anticipated. It hasn’t been so pleasant for me either. Problem is — I have to feed my family, deposit my paycheck, pick up prescriptions, etc. just like you do. And, unfortunately, no one arrived at my house today to watch my child so that his autistic behavior wouldn’t upset anyone in public. I have to leave the house and so does my child. Because I have to teach him about the world. I have to let him practice controlling his alarm system. So that he, too, can possibly be a productive citizen making come true all those dreams I had for him when he was so small.

With so many advances in early detection and therapy, many of us will be able to see most of those dreams come true for our unique children. And for some of us, our dreams will have to change for our children. We may need to re-define happiness and success. For life is like that. We constantly have to reevaluate our expectations of ourselves, others –and, sometimes, even the grocery store.

I’m hoping that your single human interaction with me has given you an opportunity to be a better person. For, with 1 in 91 children being diagnosed with autism now, you are going to have a lot more opportunities to make a positive impact in the life of someone like me. All it would take would be a smile, a pat on the back, or a “Bless your heart, honey, hang in there” to refill a stressed out parent’s reserve of patience and calm. You could be the bright spot in our day. And, then, if you want, you are welcome to ask all the questions you want. Your curiosity doesn’t offend me in the least. Most of us aren’t the least bit upset to talk about our kids – any more than you are. If anything, it is an opportunity to educate and dispel myths.

And, maybe, just maybe, you will be standing there when the alarm gets turned off. Maybe you will get to see what every mother wants the world to see – the wonderful personality of her child, in our case hidden behind a mask of fear, anger and frustration.

Who knows? Maybe I’ll get to see the one hidden behind yours.

523,"Members of the Autism community. Please get the word out and reject the California Governor's trailer bill language regarding regional center responsibility to pay deductibles, co-pay and co-insurance for ABA services as well as services affecting other categories of eligibility. Thank you!","The Conference Committee has 8 members and they have already given their ""yes"" on the trailer bill language that would place means testing on these ABA services. The amount of income for the threshold is irrelevant---THE ISSUE is that means testing is a betrayal of the Lanterman Act, which guaranteed that families would receive services at no cost. Recent legislation requires RC's to access the client's private insurance before providing services on the RC's buck, so it is easy to see that families above the threshold would not get their deductibles, co-pay and co-insurance paid by the RC, which would place financial, emotional and familial stress on them.
 
FEAT will be sending a specific official letter to the Committee and Senator Steinberg and Assemblymember Perez. WE NEED YOU TO SEND email and CALL, ATTEND Hearings.
 
Below is a letter from UCP/ARC which  covers the issue. Please follow the instructions below.
 
If you only push yourself to do ONE more thing tomorrow, PLEASE DO THIS
 
Dear Friends,

The fight goes on to have regional centers cover the health insurance deductibles and copayments for autism and other medical treatments required by IPPs and IFSPs -- but we only have a day or two more to make our voices heard.

Thank you to the hundreds of you who emailed Senator William Monning asking him to reject the Brown administration ""trailer bill"" that says regional centers don't have to cover copays and that they cannot not cover deductibles. Unfortunately, Senator Monning's subcommittee approved the trailer bill anyway.

Now the fight has moved to the budget conference committee chaired by Senator Mark Leno, which is meeting now. We and the autism groups statewide are directing our advocacy to Senator Leno and the other seven legislators on the conference committee.

Here are the two things we're asking everyone to do now. TODAY:

1. If you live in the district represented by any of the eight legislators on the conference committee, please pick up the phone and call your legislator now. Tell him or her that it is an outrage that the Brown administration wants to undermine the Lanterman Act promise by making families with insurance pay for services that everyone else gets at no charge. Say you want him or her to vote to reject the trailer bill that would allow regional centers to refuse to cover health insurance deductibles and copays for treatments that IPPs and ISFPs require.

Before your call, please take a minute to look at these suggestions for how to make calls like this: thearcca.org/46.html. It's easier than you might think.

Here are the eight conference committee members and their phone numbers:

Senator Mark Leno, Chair, (916) 651-4011
Senator Kevin DeLeon, (916) 651-4022
Senator Bill Emmerson, (916) 651-4023
Senator Loni Hancock, (916) 651-4009
Assemblymember Bob Blumenfield, (916) 319-2045
Assemblymember Jeff Gorell, (916) 319-2044
Assemblymember Holly Mitchell, (916) 319-2054
Assemblymember Nancy Skinner, (916) 319-2015

If you don't know whether you live in a district that one of these legislators represents, here's what to do: click on thearcCA.org; scroll down to red, white, and blue ""Write Your Legislators"" button; enter your ZIP code; click on ""Go""; and scroll down to the ""California Legislative Action Center"" and ""May Elected Officials.""

2. No matter where you live, take 45 seconds to call or send an email to the chair of the committee, Senator Leno. Besides being the committee chair, Senator Leno is considering running for statewide office and so should pay more attention than most legislators do to people from all over the state. His email address is senator.leno@senate.ca.gov and his phone number is (916) 651-4011.

Thank you for your advocacy.

524,I need help. Please read.,"Recently I've entered a relationship with a wonderful woman who has a 4 1/2 year old song with autism, and a neuro-typical 2 1/2 year old daughter. They are living with me and I have become a de-facto father-figure. I love them and their mommy very much.

My problem is that I have some severe anger issues when dealing with the autistic boy. I'm much older than my girlfriend, and I have a son from a previous marriage who is grown and married himself. My parenting days with him are long in the past, and I've forgotten how hard small children are to manage. But the boy's autism is something I'm apparently not able to deal with positively. He's constantly demanding, whining, manipulative, combative, impulse-driven, and obsessive. He will have periods of being the boy that both I and his mother want him to be: sweet, loving, able to listen and follow our instructions. But they seem to be few and far between, bookmarked by repeated, obsessive demands for whatever his whim is at the moment and combative meltdowns when not immediately given to him.

Given the fact that I'm upset at my failure to positively deal with this today and the anger of my girlfriend at me for it, the above description of the problem may be more dire than it actually is. The bottom line is, I have to gain some tools to deal with my anger and resentment issues towards him and some positive parenting skills for a special needs child like him. I just have no idea where to go or what to do, because me drawing on my earlier parenting experience is woefully inadequate.

Any suggestions or analysis would be welcome. Thank you.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1fnmtw/i_need_help_please_read/,183

(though I personally think it was more severe than that) I had a few suicide attempts as well as depression. There were times that I honestly hoped that one day I'd stop feeling things all together, it had to be easier to feel nothing than to constantly be all over the place emotionally. 
As I've grown up and gone through a lot of bad experiences things have affected me less and less until I've finally reached the point where I am fairly numb, that does mean I don't feel happy, nice emotions so much as I used to but for me I see it as a blessing, numb is good.

Dear friends of the mental disorder community of Reddit,

My name is /u/dimwit86. In November of 2012 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Since then I've started on medication and have been building a maintainable life for myself. 

One of the things I've been trying to get more involved in, seeking it out regularly here on Reddit, is exposure of the realities of mental illness and combating the stigma and ignorance that can be associated with it.

I reach out to you all in an effort to have an AMA for the entire community on Sat Jun 8 or Sun June 9 (best time can be figured out).

The goal would be to have a massive and comprehensive AMA + Discussion on mental illness, directly involving all of us that are directly affected in our real lives. 

Ideally, I would like a mod or two from each subreddit to act as official voices of each disorder, as well as usernames of those who wouldn't mind fielding private questions. If we have medical professionals amongst us, that would be incredible as well. 

The format of the AMA post would be something like this:

++++++  

We are the mental health community here on Reddit. AMA about mental disorders (bipolar, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, etc)

++++++  

Greetings friends! We are the members of the various mental health subreddits here on Reddit. We have decided to do one massive joint AMA in an effort to educate the public on the realities of our illnesses.

All the subscribers of our various communities have been invited to answer any and all questions you may have as well as facilitate a discussion. Our goal is to combat the stigma associated with mental illness and clear up misperceptions, generalizations and some biased ignorance that may exist.

If you don't want to ask your question publicly, the following members have agreed to field question via PM that partain to specific disorders:

Bipolar disorder:  
/u/fakename1 - Moderator /r/bipolar  
/u/fakename2 - MD/Therapist/Professional

Schizophrenia:  
/u/fakename3 - Moderator /r/schizophrenia  
/u/fakename5 - Diagnosed Schizophrenic

Depression:  
/u/fakename4 - Moderator /r/depression

We want to be as comprehensive as we can, so the more questions you ask, the better. Please be respectful and avoid generalizations, aggression and accusations.

We hope that everyone enjoys and learns from this AMA!

So go ahead, ask us anything!

++++++

I welcome all input in regards to this effort. If you have suggestions or concerns, please voice them. You are welcome to respond in this thread, but [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1fizv0/looking_to_do_a_massive_joint_ama_xpost_multiple/) ***is our master thread***. I will be x-posting various questions and comments into that thread in an effort to consolidate.

""You have a cold. You have a headache. You have a cut, but it's something that eventually will resolve itself.""   

Obviously some situations will arise where things will get worse in certain scenarios. But for the most part, my intent is to have people understand my kiddo's mind works differently, and they should understand to embrace this and not hope to ""cure"" him or change how his/her brain works.

His school is amazing and he gets a ton of support and therapy from them every day.  He's going into 1st grade next year (after repeating kindergarten, first time was 1/2 and 1/2 special ed and regular ed, 2nd time was fully regular ed) and we had him officially diagnosed so he could continue therapy over the summer.  
Any time I mention he was ""finally diagnosed"" I feel like I get pity.  I don't see it that way.  I know we are fortunate bc he is considered high functioning, but not Aspergers, and doesn't face so many of the challenges that children ( and adults) who have a more severe form face.  
Maybe that's why I didn't realize it was a ""problem."" yes, it's been a tough 6 years, and frustrating, etc.  but, so many people don't even realize he is in the spectrum, but when they find out I get sympathy.
IDK, it's such a strange journey and this is really the first time I've reached out to other parents.  Maybe bc I didn't feel qualified to until we had an official diagnosis.
Am I the only one who gets this kind of pity?  should I not share that with people who don't need to know?  I don't tell strangers, just friends or acquaintances in conversation, it's obvious that he has ""quirks"" and is dealing with a speech delay",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1fevmg/my_son_was_just_diagnosed_with_autism_and_i_didnt/,59

We're hitting what I hope is the plateau of tantrums and I'm having a very difficult time isolating what is a normal ""I'm 2 and I want my way"" tantrum and what tantrums might be related to his ASD and how to resolve them.

I have an iPhone, which he knows has apps he likes on it.  He wants my phone every time he sees it and will throw a tantrum every time he doesn't get it.  He has his own iPad, which our Autism specialist  suggested as sort of substitution method.  As in, no, you cannot have mom's phone, but you can have your iPad.  

We've been trying this for a month and we just aren't getting anywhere.  Part of the problem is this happens when we're out and about and I'll get a call and it's just not feasible to enforce this.  Sometimes I don't have his iPad with me.  

I also don't want him to have any negative connotation with the iPad because it's been an amazing learning tool.  He knows all his letters and numbers now from it and has actually started pointing.  

We also run into this issue with the television.  His only TV experience is watching a movie at bedtime.  Sometimes, he'll come downstairs from his room during the day and my husband and I will have been watching a program and if he sees the remote, he hands it to me expecting to watch a show.  If we don't comply, tantrum.  So we hide the remote and never have the TV on, but this is avoidance, it's not really solving the issue.

We try and talk him through the tantrum and never give in.  Sometimes it's 5 minutes and he's moved on, but more often than not, it's 20 minutes and he's a blubbering mess and there's no coming back from his frustration.  Usually we take him up to his room where it's dark and there's white noise to ""reboot.""

I'm just really struggling with toddler discipline and how to best approach considering his ASD.  To top it all, this started to get much worse when his little brother was born, 6 weeks ago.  

Am I overthinking it?  Should I just be doing time outs??  Picture exchange card with a big NO symbol over my phone?  

He is essentially non-verbal, but I would say he absorbs and understands most of what we say to him.  

Any help appreciated!!

541,Swearing!!,"My 5 son is five years old. Only just started becoming verbal just after Christmas. He tends to repeat words out of context at lot.

Now I don't swear around my son. (Well let's be honest I have an accident every now and then) but nothing so bad or so often as to make him feel the need to repeat it.

Anyways, I was watching Star Trek DS9 yesterday morning and my son comes in, waves at me and then says. ""Fuck you!"" And then walks out of the room like nothing happened.

I have no idea what to do. I don't believe in hitting my kids and I'm honestly pretty sure that would have no effect on him. I don't think a bar of soap in the mouth will get the message across and I'm honestly kind of freaked out about what's going to happen when he goes back to school on Monday.

I'm thinking I may call his EA and warn them that he's picked up some colorful language and I don't know how to stop him.

Any advice? Anyone?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1f2sz2/swearing/,409
542,"Calming Tea, or herbs to help with meltdowns?","My son (5 years old) has been having more intense and violent melt downs.

He is also VERY strong, he is 50 lbs and it is becoming increasingly difficult for me to stop him from hitting.   It breaks my heart to think that I may not have a choice but to medicate him if we can not find a solution that works for him.

I would like to find some sort of natural herb or tea that will help calm him, maybe something that I can make at home.  I recently purchased some ""Calms Forte for kids,"" which did absolutely nothing.

551,Requesting some literature to better understand autism.,"Hi all. I am here looking to gain more knowledge and have a better understanding of autism. I have an opportunity to work as a direct caregiver to children and adults with varying levels of autism living in a facility that works towards improving behaviors so they can live more independently. I currently live with someone who has been working there for 4 years and from what I understand is this position, being entry level, becomes a sort of revolving door and is not taken as seriously as it should be. I don't want to be one of those people.

Now, what I am looking for are any recommendations on books or articles that produced somewhat of an ""ah-ha"" moment for you, or anything that provides insight to what it is like living with this disorder, maybe something not so clinical that describes what it feels like to live with autism if that makes sense. I do understand that every person is different and there will be no blanket advice but I am hoping to go into this position as prepared as possible and would like to do research outside of their training program.  

Any advice outside of that is very much welcomed as well. Some of the points that stuck out to me from people who do similar work is patience with the children as well as their parents, picking up on cues from the children, not straying from routine, positive reenforcement and smiling :) Also when someone said ""If you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism"" struck a chord.


I am also open to pen pals who work in similar facilites, are autistic or are the parents/family members of autistic children.

The Advice Letter (pdf) from the FDA requested several changes to the exclusion criteria involving subject safety, some of which we thought were not necessary based on existing scientific literature. We have prepared an amended protocol incorporating some of these changes, along with evidence for why we don't think the other changes are necessary. Once the FDA has reviewed and approved this amendment, we will submit the protocol and study materials for review by the Institutional Review Board at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center/Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute. Charles Grob, M.D., and Alicia Danforth, Ph.D.(c), will be co-investigators for this study. 

We have a lot of work to do to raise the roughly $15 million we still need to complete our MDMA-assisted psychotherapy studies. We ask you to help us change minds and make medicines.

564,My 7 year old is having more trouble at school than ever before. Help?,"A little background on my son first.  He was diagnosed with HFA at 4 years old, and up until this school year (second grade), he's been in a special education class setting.  Last summer, we moved from California to Canada and aren't permanent residents yet, so seeking ABA is currently out of the question for us.  By nature, my son is empathetic, sweet, silly and curious.  He has never had trouble at school for hitting anyone before, and has never ever hit anyone at home.

He had been making improvements in his classroom all year.  The downward spiral started when he was bullied and beaten by someone four grades above him.  Kids have bullied him at school ever since.  He's been called a girl, gay, fag, pervert.  He's been punched, kicked and choked.  

He's been influenced by kids to throw sand, and punch other kids (of which I made my son take full responsibility for)... and I just don't know what to do anymore.  The kids in his school are a little rough.  I don't know if the school is right for him anymore, but putting that aside, I don't know how to address his issues. I started with taking his privileges away for a week, twice.  I warned him that the third time would warrant no more computer/electronics indefinitely. Well, he punched someone last week, and that was it.  Today, I got a call from the office and while he didn't punch anyone, he was punched.  He had major meltdowns today and his school had a bunch of other problematic kids to deal with, so they asked me to pick him up.

I have sucked all the fun out of his life and told him that he needs to sit in his room and think about why he is in there.  

I moved from a white collar suburb to the inner city.  I am perhaps misguided, but afraid that the school he is in, isn't good for him (the students are the problem, not the staff).  I am at wits end, and I don't know what else I can do. I don't want my brilliant child to waste his life away on poor choices.  He has wonderful aspirations and if he can't learn how to cope with life, I fear he will never be all that he wants to be.

Ugh, does anyone have suggestions, advice, or care to share experiences?

Extremely desperate mother here... :(


**Edit:** For those who are having trouble understanding what I've written, I apologize if I wasn't clear enough.  I do not punish my child for getting bullied.  While his getting bullied and his hitting other kids are most likely related, he needs to take responsibility for his actions.  

I am asking for advice on strategies to deter him from making these bad choices in school, and asking for possible coping strategies as well.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1e9ope/my_7_year_old_is_having_more_trouble_at_school/,59

577,selective mutism problems,"I was diagnosed as having high Functioning Autism about 8 years ago (I'm 29 now). I've noticed it more recently as I've had to tolerate being around people more as part of my new job - but I get really bad selective mutism when there are more than three people near me/around me.

I open my mouth to speak, and I either embarrass myself by spluttering nonsensical garbled stuttering that makes zero sense, or worse case scenario - nothing at all comes out, and I'm left standing there with my mouth open, frozen, not saying anything.

579,"Hello, I have autism, and I have some problems in my life. Could you help me? I might be able to answer some questions too.","Hello, I am a 19 year old female with diagnosed autism, and I have been keeping the same problems in my life.

I really didn't knew where to post this, and this is difficult for me, but here we go.

I always was different. Since i was a month old, my parents knew there was something wrong. I was crying non-stop. They didn't knew what to do with me, I didn't wanted to be hugged, held or talked to. I only cried a lot and contact with my parents made it even worse.

I behaved very odd during my childhood, always making myself an outcast. I was always on my own.
I had done some really odd things, and I could never be reasond with.
I started to talk in my self, making up a world out of the books I read, or the few movies I saw.
I really read a lot of books back then.

When I was 7, my mother brought me to a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with ADHD and Borderline.
I didn't even made eyecontact with te man, too cought up with the pictures hanging in the room.
Sinds then I always have been having medication and therapy.
At later age, the same man said I was having schizophrenia, and was mentally undeveloped for 3-5 years, depents on the aspect. (this I do believe in)

At school I was bullied at. Since I can remember, I always was an outcast, never had friends and always been bullied at at school.
Long time (although I don't remember much of that time)
When I was 18 I moved to another school, and for the first time, I was not bullied at.
I did not knew how to act. It was a whole new world to me, people acting nice at school.

School and work (I have worked at age 16-18) where war-zone's for me. It felt that way.
There was noise, people laughing, kouching, talking, yelling, looking, moving. There where always threats I saw, and there where huge fears.

I was trapped inside my mind. My mind always becomes a thick white fog, where everything goes slower, on schools and workplaces. It also happens on crouded area's and occasualy at home.

I can not talk in that state. Nor can I process anything or really do something.
It is still very annoying, and I get frustrated when and after it happens.

Anyone who reconizes this?

I have been having these destructive moods lately, and now I have medication what really helps. When I'm having such a mood, I am so sad, angry and frustrated that I yell at some one, or I start hurting myself.
Afterwards I am cleaning up the mess I made, am very ashaimed. I am not the girl who is showing her self in those moods.

There are moods where I only am able to think that I must die, or be gone or be hurt. And it does not always ends well then.

2 years back, I was admitted to a mental hospital, because I was very suicidal. It also had an good side, there I was diagnosed with autism, and a year later, I was admitted to a facility, designed to help people with autism, to give them support for work and a home.

A lot of us go to an more independed home, some of us go to a long term living form, where you have your own apparement with help.

I might sign up for that.

Now I have activety's on the terrain, and therapy's.
There are nurses here at this unit, and I have been having more contact than ever.
I am happy here, and that never happened, I can find peace and quitness here, and structure.
Things are finally good, the fog keeps appairing lesser, the Darkness also does. (my moods and depression, I like to call it Darkness) 


Another thing, I wrote back earlier, that at some point, I started talking in myself a lot. 
Since I was 15, I started doing this in English, a foreign language, and I still do it a lot, sometimes even in public.

Anyone who reconizes this?

This was most of my story, I wanted to share this with you, because I could not simply ask the question before you knew my story.

I was posting on different subreddit's, until I thought it might be easier if I just told everything on one subreddit, instead to post bits and pieces on a lot of subreddit's.

I'll hope you forgive my bad English, and if you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them.

Update 1: 
Hi, I e-mailed the tekst to my 1st nurse here.
We talked for what seemed like a whole morning and we are going to look on until january, and then we look further.
I emailed a really messed up letter, I was a bit confused and sad.
Thanks for all the help!

Update 2:
Hi, a small update. I get an intake at a supportive housing home. It is quite scary, and good at the same time. The nurses say that they finally see what I am capable of, and they say that all these years I have been overasked, always too much pessure. I thought about it and I understand it. Until my 18th nobody knew what autism was, so everyone asked a lot of me. And this year in this facitity, I finally saw that nobody wants to put pressure on me anymore, they actually want me to be happy!
I never saw that.
I am going to focus on beeing happy now. Now, I have a lot of therapy and no responsibility's anymore.

581,Culture shock that never ends. (personal rant),"From my earliest memories to the present, I have felt alienated from society.  
  
When I was a teenager I was charged with a nonviolent felony, increasing this sense of alienation to a literal prohibition from public service.  
  
Three years ago I earned a bachelor of arts degree from a noncompetitive state university. My grades were terrible and I barely qualified for graduation.  
  
After ten years of working countless part-time jobs in the service industry, I have lost all desire to mitigate the effects of my personality, or search for a proper role in society. I'm not sure I am capable of becoming a fully functioning member.  
  
The people I have worked with were generally my only social contacts, aside from a handful of revolving, yet still meaningful relationships.  
  
Interacting with others is taxing for me. Roommates have found me difficult to live with.  
  
I try to be like other people, but in social settings I struggle to play the right role, and look for any excuse to retreat back to the comfort of isolation.  
  
I just want to read, and enjoy food, water, and shelter. I can't support myself and have moved into my parents' home. They are trying to help me find work, but the thought of more wage chasing feels like slavery to me.  
   
It's not that I am depressed or lonely. I just cannot, and have no desire to, integrate myself into a meaningful community.  
    
I'm not sure this is the right forum to vent my frustration. I suspect that I am neurologically atypical, but am too anxious to seek medical guidance. I fear that my failed life story is too common, and that others will think I am searching for an excuse.

584,"How aware is this subredditt of the link between advanced paternal age and autism? I am interested, because I keep hearing how vaccines are linked to this diagnosis, and not the age of the father.","For those of you unfamiliar with this research, mounting evidence, largely gathered from genetic studies in Scandinavia, points to advanced paternal age as a contributing factor in autism diagnoses in children.  Apparently, males' DNA replication machinery present in germ cells (the cells of the testes, which fertilize the egg of females during intercourse), as in all cell lines, begins to deteriorate after the age of 23.
Females do not have this problem because they are not making new germ cells throughout life as males are (instead, they generate a finite amount of eggs early in life, and shed them gradually following puberty as they age - sorry for the review if this is not new to you). 
At any rate, younger men, who have more accurate DNA replication in their germs cells, pass fewer mutations to their offspring than their older counterparts.  And a higher number of mutations raises the risk of a number of conditions, including autism.
I didn't write all this because I want to discourage the random older guy from having a kid.  Rather I want to direct conversation to this area of research, which is being taken seriously by scientists, and not vaccines.  Here's a NYT article on the topic:

591,[24/f] I interviewed with a family for a nanny job. 4-YO son has PPD NOS. What should I expect?,"I'm a graduate student and trying to find a full-time nanny job for the summer. I met with one family yesterday and overall, they seem great. Parents are laid-back with a good sense of humor, great house and neighborhood, and their current nanny (who is moving to Europe with her fiance, which is why she's leaving them after two years) seems to love working with them. They have two daughters who are 10 and 6, and a son who is turning 4 this week. The girls seem great but the boy was in a VERY bad mood when I came over. Cranky, whining, refused to say hi to me, and was sucking on a pacifier, which seemed a little odd for a child that age. They said he had been playing  outside all day and was tired. I know kids that age can have meltdowns when they have had a long day, so I didn't think much of it.

Then the parents told me he has a developmental disability called pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, or PDD-NOS. I'd never heard of it but the way they described it sounded like it fell on the autism spectrum. I asked if it was and they said he does fall on the spectrum but is on the extremely high-functioning end, and that he is affectionate, gets along well with other children, etc. They also said they've been very proactive about it and that he'll be going to a special daycamp this summer for kids like him where they work on various skills.

I don't doubt that he's a sweet child and that the parents are doing all they can. And maybe it's just because my first impression of the child was so bad. I have no experience with children on the autism spectrum, but I'm not sure I could handle the major meltdowns. If I am offered the job, which I think I have a pretty good shot at, I want to be sure what I'm in for if I accept so I don't a) overwhelm myself and b) then have to quit, putting them in a shitty situation.

594,18YO Autistic Student being Denied Senior Year,"This is hopefully to help an old friend's brother Haven't talked to him in a couple years but would like to help him out. His brother was a very nice kid when I knew him. Here are the updates from the family. Hopefully someone here has some information that could help them out to give Tyler the graduation he has worked so hard for and deserves:

Tyler is an 18 year old high school student with special needs. As a special education student he will be in the public school system until he turns 22. We had scheduled his ""Official Senior Year"" for the 2013-2014 school year. This was supported and approved by the school and district administration at the first of the school year, and reconfirmed by email in November 2012. We have had no other communication about this matter UNTIL April 12, 2013. On April 12, 2013 we were informed by telephone that things had changed. Suddenly he was now a Senior with enough credits to graduate and would be forced to receive a Special Diploma at the end of this school year. He would also be forced to leave his current school and attend another facility, even further from home, for vocational training until age 22. He is being denied the ""Senior Experience"" which he has worked so hard to enjoy. No picture in the yearbook. No Prom. No grad-night. No graduation ceremony with his family in attendance (there isn't time to arrange this now.) We have sent emails and made phone calls to EVERYONE we think could help us, but without success. If you have an idea, please share your thoughts.

Most recent Update:

Some of you have asked for some clarification of our issue. Actually we have two issues going on. First is the issue of the school denying Tyler his Senior year of high school. I've explained that in the 'About' section above. Basically, we were told and reassured more than once, that he would be participating in graduation and all senior activities in 2014. They school is now denying this, even though I have written documentation and notes that prove otherwise.

The second issue is the reason we have the first issue. It is the new transition plan for students with disabilities that Duval county schools has just put in place. Up until now, high school students with disabilities could stay in their current school program until they were 22 or earned a regular diploma. Between ages 18-22 they could choose which year to participate in graduation and ""walk"", but would not accept a Special Diploma until age 22. This left options open to them to attend vocational programs at FSCJ as a dual-enrollment student. The students could also choose to transition to another program if it was deemed appropriate for them. 

The new plan is forcing students with disabilities to graduate with a Special Diploma at the end of their 4th year of high school. Then they must transition to another facility until they are 22. There are very few options to choose from, and none of the options are very good for Tyler. The option for FSCJ is still there but can only be taken the first year after they leave high school, and most students are not quite ready at 18 and don't have the testing scores needed to be enrolled. (like Tyler)

Tyler's teachers did not become aware of this new plan until the same day we did, April 12, 2013. They say they had heard rumors but could not get anyone from district to meet with them to explain the plan until April 12. His teachers are great! They are creative and excited to be teaching these special students. I am at a loss as to why they would not be told of this new plan so they could prepare the students from the beginning of the year. I also cannot understand WHY THE PARENTS WERE NOT INFORMED before now. There just isn't an excuse possible to explain this.

As I said, none of the transition options for Tyler are good ones, and none of them allow him to stay where he is and have his senior year. We have already been informed that he will be placed at Alden Road Exceptional Student Center. This is a facility that houses students with disabilities from ages 11-22. A large percentage of those students are profoundly disabled. There are NO non-disabled students at this center. We toured it today and knew within a few minutes that it was not appropriate for Tyler. We had already been told by several people who know Tyler and know about this facility, that it would not be a place for him to thrive. 

We had NO part in deciding if this would be an appropriate placement for Tyler. This decision was made mostly by people who don't know Tyler at all. They may have read about him in a file, but they don't actually know him. After all these years of inclusion into a regular, normal, typical, non-disabled school experience, our school district is taking a GIANT leap backwards. Students that have been included in regular education whenever possible, and have thrived there, are now being sent to spend all of their school time with students that are disabled. There will be regression for these students. We cannot and will not let this happen to our son. We have been advocating for him for 18 years and we will never stop!

The other parent and I have not been together for quite some time. Even after no longer being involved, we tried to continue to live together, but it just did not work. We have lived separately for quite some time, though the other parent still lives close by. 

Custody is informal, but the situation out of the past year has been as follows:

Their schools do not provide transportation. I drive them to and from school every day, with exception to the past month, where the other parent has picked them up 1-2 days a week. If I am doing drop off and pick up it takes about 90 minutes total.

The eldest child has spent the past 350 nights at my house, 15 with a relative other than the other parent. The youngest has spent the past 365 nights at my house. The other parent has had the eldest child for 8-16 hours per week in the daytime, the youngest child for 5-10 hours per week in the day time.

There are other relatives in the area, as I mentioned. Two sets of grandparents, aunts, uncles. One grandmother is very ill, and cannot get around much. One grandmother is very close by, is self employed, and has not spent an hour with either child, save for holiday dinners. One grandfather is about 40 minutes away, frequently takes the eldest places or for sleepovers, will spend time with both children together very occasionally, once a month or less for a few hours. One grandfather is about 2 hours away and does not speak to this part of the family. Aunts and uncles see the children infrequently or not at all.

Does anyone else have this?

It bothers me on so many levels. Because family members should be nicer to my kids, because they have enough to deal with on a daily basis. Because of the seeming favoritism towards other children of other family members that both my kids see. Because of the favoritism towards my eldest that my youngest sees. 

Because I do not understand how a parent can go for days without seeing or talking to their child when nothing is stopping them from doing so.

Because there is no reputable, qualified child care in my area for my youngest, and with no support, I can't find a job that will hire me to work only when my kids are in school.

The only place that will keep me on treats employees very poorly, and does not pay well. I am a fairly qualified individual, with lots of experience, but nothing in my field is available within the restrictions of my schedule. I do not receive any child support, though one child is biologically mine, the other is not, and ironically, the other parent receives payments for the one that is not mine.

Does anyone else deal with this? 

Has anyone, anywhere found ways of getting past any of these obstacles? 

I don't know what to call how I feel, but I miss not feeling this way.

:(

I'll admit I don't know anything much about autism, but their parents want me to do whatever I can to help their children. I'm not trained for this, but they seem to be responding to love, kindness and friendliness. 

It's not my job to help them, or anyone else's job in this school; nobody here is trained for this, and nobody knows what to do. They're all concerned about the children, but no matter what they do, it's not really helping. We want to help. I can't stand seeing them getting left behind, and I want to do everything I can. They're expected to get along with, and integrate into the classroom with many other children, but it's proven almost impossible. I actually got 1 of them to participate in the English games, and I felt like that was milestone for him, but it only happened once. 

Any kind of tips on helping them would be greatly appreciated. I am just an English teacher, but I wish to become a pediatrician in the future... so I really love working with kids. 

I don't look at them as people with disabilities. They're different, yes, but not really. They just need to be taught differently, I guess.

A few days a go, I submitted two links to this subreddit. I did so with a genuine aim to raise awareness in the general reddit community, but my methods lacked a delicacy that should come with any discussion of autism, especially from an outsider. Mods later informed me that others have been trolling r/autism this month with derogatory and otherwise insulting material, and this context likely made my posts even more hurtful.

Thankfully, mods have given me a chance to apologize to this courageous and fierce community. I'm sorry for any feelings I hurt, and I especially want to extend my very best wishes to you all on a campaign to raise awareness and acceptance for autism. I do not know anyone on the spectrum, and yet your efforts were able to impact me nonetheless.

She has a nine year old son, and we spend time with them once every couple months (they live several hours away) and have since he was born. Over the years since watching him grow I have noticed that he shows an overwhelming number of symptoms of something that may be Asperger's syndrome. He has a great deal many interests (bordering on obsessions) that while admirable intellectually aren't even remotely age-appropriate (Greek mythology at the age of six, for example) and no interest in anything other kids his age enjoy, he doesn't really understand the concept of personal space or boundaries (he met my aunt on the other side of the family for the first time at my sister's wedding and immediately sat on her lap, at the age of seven, and attached to her the entire night) he has never really grasped the ideas of body language or interpreting someone's tone of voice, he is incredibly intelligent (he watches the Big Bang Theory and gets most of it) and condescends to adults (even ones he doesn't know)- that's a short list, but there are many things over the years we have noticed that concern us (my mother and I are both nurses and work in pediatrics, so we're very familiar with typical child development, and she agrees with me that something isn't quite right). Anyway, he has never been tested for anything on the spectrum, and my mother has never said anything to her cousin about her suspicions, which I find a but frustrating. I'm not a huge fan of labeling kids and normally I'd be happy to mind my own business, but it has gotten to the point where he is being bullied so severely that he has told his mom he wants to kill himself (specifically to take a knife and cut off his head until he dies, because that's how they killed Medusa in the story he read- his words). It breaks my heart, and I think if he were to actually have something like Asperger's and be diagnosed, it would open doors for him to get therapy to control some of the more troubling behaviors (inappropriate attachment to strangers, etc.) and at the VERY least, could have some opportunities to connect with other kids who are like him so he didn't feel so lonely and could actually make some friends.

Anyway, so, to my question. Would it be extremely rude to suggest to his mom that he may have a problem? Is there any good way to do it? If a close friend/family member had noticed the signs of an autism spectrum disorder in your child, would you want to know? I don't want to offend her or damage our relationship, but I'm so concerned about his future, especially since he's expressed suicidal thoughts. He's a very lonely kid and it breaks my heart.

616,I thought this would be a good place to ask about autism.,"Hello, firstly I would like to say that I posted this in /r/Aspergers because I do not know which one I should post in asking my question. Heres my question:

When I was a child I was seemingly average. I played with the neighbor kids, usually pretending. When I got into public school I don't remember having very many close friends, but it didn't really bother me to talk to other children. My teachers used to say I was creative and good at writing, and I even spent a couple years in a Gifted and Talented class. But once I got to around 5th and up, I began to act very antisocial and self conscious. Bullying probably attributed to this, but I was never scared to talk to people I sort of knew. Im now in high school and since 5th grade, I have acted antisocial. I thoroughly enjoy the alone time I set aside each afternoon, when I shoot hoops in my driveway alone.
 I use this time to think about my day and just general thoughts. I like this time and I feel comfortable when I am alone. In school I don't like to talk to new people, or people I don't generally associate with, even though I have friends. My parents tell me I am quiet and withdrawn, and I don't like it when people point out that I am shy. I tend to stay silent unless I am spoken to, and I usually have to muster something up when I am spoken too.
When I first noticed how often people pointed out how withdrawn or quiet I was, I didn't really worry. But after a while I looked into my symptoms. I don't think it is depression, because I have my days where I am sad, but generally I am happy. But people still question if I am depressed because they say I don't act happy. I don't know how to show it besides smiling, but I only smile when I laugh or am really enjoying something. When I am happy I think its like I'm happy in my head. My body doesn't really show it, but I'm in a nice state of mind.

Anyways, I took an AQ test online, because I don't really want to go to my parents (not that I dont want to interact with them, I talk to them alot. I just feel it would be weird if I went to them about it.) 

Anyways, I scored a 33, and the site said that a 32 or above ment autism or aspergers. It said numbers slightly lower than 32 could be in the range, so I guess I'm far enough to wonder. (Im not a specialist, sorry If i sound like I am self diagnosing myself.)

 I don't know if I have either, but from my understanding, I seem to associate with the symptoms of aspergers pretty well. I don't have any particular attraction to numbers, and I have a somewhat vivid imagination (I like to tell storys to myself in my head a lot when I am alone).


Does it sound like anything? Id love any replies, I would appreciate it very much for anyone to chime in.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1d20s8/i_thought_this_would_be_a_good_place_to_ask_about/,59

Hi guys, thanks for the responses, I thought seen as you guys are so supportive and that the least I can do is give you an update.

So it's been a week or 2 since I found out and I realised I can't hate every one about this, I've come to terms that this isn't something that's against me, it's just who I am and how I tick. After my mum explained my youth and how I behaved I started to understand how I behaved before in my early years, Teens and even 20's up until now. 

The main reason why I wasn't confirmed to have Autism is because when I was born (1988) they hadn't broadened the autism spectrum to include me in it, since then I have understood that this is really an umbrella diagnosis that can cover a range of issues all the way to including aspergers syndrome. Since knowing this I can't exactly justify having a grudge against any one, as they were just getting to understand autism in the medical sector.

I've come to terms with what I have and realising I don't have to change my self feels like I have taken weight off my shoulders, but I've also grown alot more rounded and mature to understand how I work and my thought process. This in turn I advised my employee about this and asked them for support in certain areas, that they were gladly happy to do and has improved my life greatly.

I want to thank people on /r/autism for their support and welcome to this community, were gunnah be ok! :)",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cutg3/update_i_24m_found_out_i_am_autistic_last_night/,468

622,"Looking for input regarding picture book to help with communication, socialization, etc. for child possibly on spectrum.","I have a three year old son who hasn't been officially diagnosed with being on the autistic spectrum.  Obviously this is because he is three, and we do not see a diagnosis as anything that is currently necessary, especially in regards to what resources are available to him.  He has been receiving therapy (speech and OT) for about six months now.  It is suspected that he may have asperger's, but again, this isn't a priority.  He is an awesome little guy and we perpetually celebrate who he is as an individual. 

It was recommended to us to create a visual schedule for him - and we did, it isn't a problem for us to follow, we have always been fairly routine.  The only obstacle was the visual part (this was a problem with me creating it, it was slightly overwhelming, like a stressful art project - I always take things a bit far, I complicate simple tasks). 

It was recommended that we create him a picture book as well, and I have perpetually struggled with this.  He is currently in a pre-school environment and his teacher really feels as though his current areas of focus should be on his communication and socialization, which is congruent with his past therapy focuses, etc., so we agree in this regard.  She told me to continue to model behaviors for him, to make and let him watch videos of scripted dialogue for various behaviors (like sharing, again, he's three, and do we ever really learn how to share?), and to finally get around to making that photo book that I never made.  

OK, so my point and inquiry, those of you who are on the spectrum, did you/do you have a photo book?  Did you have cards?  Emotion cards? 

Should I just buy a set of conversation cards (such as these: http://www.nationalautismresources.com/conversation-autism.html)? It would certainly be more economical to make it myself, I'm just overwhelmed with the idea of it not being effective.  When he and I are together, we understand each other perfectly, and no, it's not because I am perpetually anticipating his needs.  At home we are at our best, in public, we have issues, around other children and around strangers we have issues. 

So, I'm looking for experiences, what may help when making the book.  I started a list of topics such as ADLs, food choices, going to school, going home, social things (pictures of hugging, holding hands, sharing a toy, children playing together), etc.

His teacher also suggested some cards with sentences on them that he can hand to someone he is trying to talk to, like, one with his photo and a sentence saying hello, his name is.., i am three.., and such.

We're not just playing board games—we're getting lights, buzzers, music... the works. And we're doing it to raise $5,000 for the American Cancer Society and the Kennedy Krieger Institute, an internationally recognized institution dedicated to improving the lives of individuals with disorders of the brain, spinal cord, and musculoskeletal system.

We're turning to reddit to help us get the word out. We've got great perks for donors and we're going to put on a great broadcast.

If you don't have cash, please send our links out via your preferred social media outlets. We want the eyes of the world on us so we can put on a great show. http://www.facebook.com/24HourGSM is our Facebook page and http://www.twitter.com/24HourGSM is our Twitter page.

632,Help coaching a child with undiagnosed Autism on a soccer team,"I am the assistant coach for my son's soccer team for the 4th year now, working with the same coach and mostly the same group of 9-10-11 year old boys.  This year, we have a new boy on the team, I'll call him B.  

During the first practice of the season, I suspected B was somewhere on the high functioning autism spectrum due to his behavior.  I would NEVER bring this up to the parents, and since they didn't bring it up to me, I'm not breaching the subject with them AND I have to assume that they either don't want to know, or don't see the signs.  I have several friends with autistic kids, and B is just like them.

Just so you know where I'm coming from, let me tell you what I observe.  He doesn't like to be touched (jerking away from physical contact, but not flinching like an abused kid would - I've seen that too), He LOVES rules, knows all of them and all the positions, he paces and talks to himself, he cannot handle long series of instructions, he tries VERY hard, but he takes a LOT longer than the other boys to work on a skill (running and kicking evade him completely, he cannot seem to get his body in sync with his mind), he completely avoids eye contact, and at the first game he just walked off the field when he was done (without telling anyone at all, and the coach and I didn't notice until I counted kids (maybe 60-90 seconds after he left the field) and paced back and forth talking to himself about no one passing it to him...

Here's what I have started to do with him at the advice of friends, in no particular order.  If any of you can think of ANYTHING else, please let me know and I'll try to incorporate it into my limited time with him.  I'm giving him short declarative instructions (kick the ball the same time I do) instead of the longer instructions the other boys get.  I'm working with him directly enough to give him the extra time, but not so much that it makes him feel different or left out.  When he does work with the other kids, I do my best to put him with my son or the head coaches son, who all know he has special needs.  I'm letting him ALWAYS work with his ball (turns out, that's a trigger...who knew??!).  I put him into and pull him out of the game for MUCH shorter times than the other boys, but he's in the game for the same total amount of time as the other kids (he goes in for 2-3 plays, then comes out and we talk about it briefly - I try to point out the good stuff he's done, he's hard enough on himself - where the other boys rotate out every 7-10 minutes).  

I want him to have a good/great experience in soccer, not just because he's got special needs, but because he's a good kid at heart, I just don't know what else I can do to help him without totally making him feel different and outside the normal, which is something that I'm trying VERY hard not to do.  

Some more suggestions my friends have come up with are having him put his hands on my face when I'm talking to him, making sure that I get to his level (eye to eye) when I talk to him (even if he's not looking), and make sure that I continue the things that I am doing.

any ideas would be welcomed, I'm trying to do the right thing for this sweet little boy, he tries SO hard and I want him to succeed.

Im a 18 yo male with autism(pdd-nos) and in the future (yeaaaaars later) I hope to have children with my now girlfriend.

(Having all kinds of ideas of being together forever and all that fun stuff.)

But when I tought about it seems pretty hard for a person with autism to raise kids. When I cant even express my own feelings how do I learn a kid to do that? 

I got a couple of questions but feel free to tell me everything about your experiences. 


1) How old are/is your child(ren)?

2) do(es) your child(ren) have autism as well? How do you handle that? Do you have any conflicts with your children because of the autism?

3) is it hard for you to tell what you want your child too do and or express yourself ?

I really have no idea what i should ask further, but i was thinking about how it can be hard to raise a kid when you have autism.

I really dont want kids in the near future but Im just interested in how you parents handle this.

636,"Autism and an obsession with ""completeness"" or ""perfection""","Howdy everybody, I'm not a subscriber here and first and foremost I will say that aside from my training regarding interacting with special patient populations as an EMT, I am not particularly well versed on autism. Nevertheless, I think this community is the best place for me to get some insight on this question:

For the longest time, I have had an obsession with ""perfection"" in my life. This has been debilitating in a lot of ways, mostly in just creating thought-forms that seem to limit my own imagination. For instance, I am trying to buy a house and I find it VERY difficult to even conceive of the process without obsessing over all the things I want to do to the property: immediately put on a steel roof, get a commercial-grade water heater, induction stove, tile the heck out of everything, plant fruit trees in the yard, etc. and if I look at a house where those options wouldn't be available to me, I get a little downtrodden about it.

Now I'm also a builder by trade, so my obsession with this stuff can be explained by the fact that I find it artistically fulfilling to have control over a physical space, and as someone who has always rented it is the kind of constant impulse that I've never been able to exert. But here's another example:

I really like certain board games, and when I get into them I REALLY get into them, like I'll buy a game, play it a couple times, and then go spend several hundred dollars in one big spree just to acquire every single available expansion for it, including anything off eBay that might be out of print. Now on the one hand, again, I don't really see anything wrong with having a complete set of something you enjoy and use all the time, but I've been able to step back and recognize it as a specific mental process and realize that it actually causes me a little bit of anxiety if I'm missing just a single piece from a game or whatever. Everything. has. to. be. perfect. And if it can't be, I sometimes don't even bother involving myself with it.

So here's where my question comes in. Recently I was discussing board games (specifically Last Night on Earth, for the curious) on another forum and someone else on there was talking about this same urge to have every expansion set or whatever and ended up saying something like ""damn autism haha""

I realize that at this point I'm just pulling conclusions from a throwaway, half-joking comment that some stranger posted online, but it intrigued me because I had never heard anyone talk about this need for ""completeness"" or ""perfection"" as being associated with autism, and it occurred to me that if there was indeed a connection of some sort, then there might be literature out there about it, and that I might find such reading to be extremely interesting.

So to sum up, I have never been diagnosed as autistic and I don't personally identify with that label, but I do recognize a certain trait of my thinking that may or may not be related to autism in some way and I'd be very grateful if any of you could clarify the connection if indeed one exists, and furthermore point me in the direction of any good articles, blogs, etc. that might focus on this specific concept because I'd love to read about other people's experiences with it. 

Thanks! :)",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cfcng/autism_and_an_obsession_with_completeness_or/,483
637,"Visiting my autisitc nephew in a couple of weeks, looking for some help.","Let me start this post with 2 apologies. First for the long rambling I know this is going to become, and second for anything I say in this question that may be inappropriate or offensive.  Please believe that is not my intention.  Now on to my question......

In a couple of weeks my wife and I will be going to visit her nephew for his 3rd birthday.  We don’t see them often, and in the last year, he has been diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum, though the therapists say it’s too soon to identify the severity.  The last time we saw him was pre-diagnosis, but my wife had some suspicions.  I have a 2 year old son that I play with a lot, and when we are with them, I noticed my nephew definitely did not like the type of playing I did with my son (plenty of rough housing and wrestling).  He has an older brother who is 5 that I also play with in this manner and he loves it.  My question is: Is there a particular way I can interact with him or play with him that he will like? I don’t want to be playing with my son or his older brother and he be left out, but I’m also afraid of trying to play with him and it backfiring.  I know all kids are different, so what may be applicable so some children will not work for others, I’m just looking for ideas.  I’m fine buying something if someone has an idea for a particular toy he might enjoy.  I’m also fine with a different activity – doesn’t have to be rough housing, can be puzzles, coloring, etc. 

As I said, I apologize if any of this came out wrong.  I just want to have a good time with my son and nephews without anyone being left out, but I’ve never had any experience with an autistic child before.  Thank you for any help or suggestions.

-What kind of resources do you look at that someone like myself could advertise? 
-Do you think families would be more iterested in school hours (for kids not young enough to go to school) or nights/weekends?
-Are most of you happy with the amount of therapy your child recieves or would you be interested in hiring on a second therapist for more treatment?
-What would you consider a fair price? I would plan on charging hourly.

641,Are any of the others on the spectrum here bothered by Nicole Hockley's voice?,"She's the mother of Dylan, an autistic boy killed at Newton who is talking a lot on the media about gun control.

Her interview starts here, at [8:45](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26315908/ns/msnbc_tv-rachel_maddow_show/vp/51524234/#51524234)

Voices like hers drive me absolutely crazy. Make me want to stim so bad.

I don't understand her. She's relying heavily on an emotional argument, and it's working like mad, because who would dare to argue with the mother of a murdered autistic boy? No one would.

Maybe Dylan was pure, but it wasn't because he was autistic. That is only the exact same issue of whether Adam Lanza was evil because of his autism. 

It offends me so much when parents of autistic kids believe they are speaking for their children's best interests, when they are really just exploiting someone else's disability for their own political purposes. 

How do we know Dylan wouldn't have grown up to have doubts about what his mother is doing? 

Blindly championing political bills in the name of a child only ensures that those bills become Orwellian in power. Who would dare question [Megan's Law](http://thnt.gns.gannettonline.com/article/B3/20060306/SPECIAL07/101120017) or the [three strikes law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Polly_Klaas#Aftermath_and_legacy) in california that now makes it standard practice to [sentence shoplifters to life sentences](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/cruel-and-unusual-punishment-the-shame-of-three-strikes-laws-20130327).

Nicole Hockley claims to be doing what she's doing in DC for her own purposes, but what idealist isn't? That doesn't mean that they aren't being careless. That doesn't mean they won't be exploited by career opportunists. 

Anyway, it's not just her. It's a systemic problem. Autism Speaks is the perfect example of non-autistics exploiting me and my condition for their own purposes. I am perfectly aware that's what is going on, but I am all but powerless to do anything for it, because they took my voice away from me when they ""speak.""

644,My girlfriend has a 2 year old with autism,"I have been dating a woman for 5 months now who has a daughter that is developmentally delayed. 

She just turned 2 years old a few weeks ago. She just started walking about 5 months ago. She doesn't speak yet at all. 

They haven't officially diagnosed her with anything yet. The last thing they're testing for is testable genetic disorders. She has a lot of the signs though. She doesn't like certain sounds (almost painful for her). She has a handful of repetitive movements that she'll do for several minutes at a time. She has almost no interest in social interaction. She has very little communication (no eye contact, speech, gestures). She often seems in her own little world.

Having said all that, she is so adorable. She gets excited about certain things that fascinate her (like lights, legos and mirrors). For the legos, she doesn't actually play with them, but if you put them together for her, she absolutely loves taking them apart. She'll do it for 30 minutes, laughing the whole time. 

She is a very happy little girl, she rarely has any tantrums. She is always smiling and laughing. She plays mostly on her own, but she will occasionally come over and put her hands up to be picked up (one of her few gestures). It is always hard to get her attention, she won't turn her head to her name or even sounds. The only things that seems to pull her back into our world is putting legos in front of her. She doesn't make any eye contact. While she doesn't interact with people, she does seem to like being near people. 

She is already in weekly physical, speech and occupational therapy. Her physical therapy has made tremendous progress over the past few months. From not walking to attempting to run already. There isn't really any noticeable progress on the others. 

My questions are:

1) It seems to be hard to get much information on how functioning she will be. She is so young it is hard to know how much of it is just her being young. Does anyone here have insight into this based on the information?

2) Her mother is a wonderful mother and it isn't really my place to recommend anything, but are there any good resources on working with toddlers that I could read for myself? I'd love to play with her, I just don't know how.

3) Any other recommendations?

I'm currently on a weeks Vacay from work, to help spring clean / redecorate the house and to get away from work for a while. 

I live with my parents due to the economic climate I'm in no position to move out (however I did live on my own for almost a year in another city far away.) After taking my car to the garage to get fixed up and weighing some clothes to be sold, my mum returns from work.

While we chatted about the then thing's about each others day and current affairs she asks ""Has any one even sat down with you to tell you and explain how your autistic?"" And me taken back by shock just plainly explained ""no, not one person in school, not any of my teachers"" She said ""Well did you not realise because you was in special need's in school"" I thought I was just not as clever and needed help with some subjects and that was it. Didn't know I was in there for a reason.

Since knowing this I went out to hang about with a few mates and kept quiet about the subject with it plaguing my mind all night and this morning... I got up, feeling really angry at every one, it's like I can't trust any one any more, because no one fucking tell's me any thing. I'm not necessarily angry at my parents, because they believed that my school would have explained what autism was to me.

Any way's my mum wishes to explain what it is for me, but I don't think I wanna know any more, whats the point, fair enough I'd understand my self better but it's still not going to change anything. It's not going to change who I am and how I work, I'd rather not be labeled as autistic when I can hold proper intelligent debates with other people and actually be 'normal' to other people.

Sure it would explain alot about my behavior in the past but the past has gone since and I don't see much value in it. And I don't want the next time that I have an episode (that is pretty much rarely any ways from what I believe) to just label it down to Autism I dont see any point in knowing about it now seen as I've gotten this far in Life not knowing.

However I still have this bitter and firing rage at every one.

652,Question regarding Aspergers video resources,"Hi all, 

I'm running an Aspergers social group and am having some difficulty finding age appropriate video resources that demonstrate appropriate cooperation. The clients involved in the group are extremely high functioning and as such the materials one would typically use (e.g model me) are not appropriate and they would likely find them condescending (at the very least I would get a lot of eye rolling). I'm currently looking into YouTube videos and other popular media as alternatives. Does anyone have any suggestions?

654,Mild case or subclinical autism?,"Hello there. 
I'm aware that you probably get a lot of ""am I autistic"" questions here, but getting an assigment with an expert could take quite a while, and the question just keeps bothering me, so a bit of feedback would be appreciated.

Symptoms that'd suggest a case of Asperger syndrome:

- pretty bad motor skills since early childhood: terrible at handicraft, concussions due to stumbling all the time
- impaired social skills: no eye-contact, phone calls often taking seconds due to lack of small-talk, a tendecy to monologue
- pointless routines: used to collect pretty random things during childhood, like chestnuts. Nowadays, I tend to wash my hands a lot and prepare certain foods (like sandwiches) in a meticulous way. None of those to an extent I'd consider obsessive, though.
- mild sensory issues: Can't stand certain textures and ""annoying"" voices. Also motion sickness.
- something that could be described as shutdowns or hypersomnia when I'm bored (also present during childhood, was described as absent-minded by teachers).


Traits that'd be contrary to an ASD:

- no particular difficulty with socialising during grade school, that became a problem way later.
- while I have special interests, not being able to act out on them isn't unnerving.
- no signs of ADHD or similar comorbidities.
- mirroring emotions. While I'm not quite sure if I mirror the more subtle stuff, I'm prone to infectious laughter, for instance.


That's all I can think of right now. Thanks for reading!",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1bxi0u/mild_case_or_subclinical_autism/,493

658,Beer. Autism. Hope. Lance's Brewery Tour launches,"Rare Brain Films announced a new campaign called BEER. AUTISM. HOPE. to help bring to life Lance's Brewery Tour, a documentary and book set to follow an extraordinary beer historian with autism as he journeys to fulfill his lifelong dream. Throughout April, autism awareness month, people can contribute on Kickstarter to help bring Lance's inspiring story to life. Both the documentary and the book are poised to make an incredible impact on the public as well as the autism community.
 

If it took nearly 40 years for your dream to come true, would you give up? Now in his mid-fifties, Lance Rice is a gifted historian with a passion for beer and a rare photographic memory. For over three decades Lance has used his computer-like mind to memorize a staggering amount of knowledge in beer and brewery history. Yet even more astonishing is the fact that Lance has never been able to share his passion with the world, but he still has not given up on his dream.
 
Lance's Brewery Tour will follow Lance on a 1500 mile roadtrip as he visits the breweries of the Midwest and to fulfill his lifelong dream to write a book about the history and culture of American Beer. The documentary chronicles Lance's awe-inspiring journey as he faces his social fears and phobias and spends nearly a month away from home to collect the photos, experiences and information he needs to write his book. When the documentary is complete Lance will finally hold a published copy of Lance's Brewery Tour, a dream that has been 40 years in the making.
 
""Lance's life story is a rare triumph of hope, faith and overcoming incredible odds,"" stated Rare Brain Studios President, Aaron Rice. ""We are so excited to share his heartwarming journey with the world and give back to the autism community.""
 
Lance's Brewery Tour will not only shed positive light on autism through Lance's unlikely heroic journey but also give hope to friends and families with autistic loved ones and provide support for autistic people to pursue their own dreams. Production will begin in Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis and more throughout the Midwest in the coming months when the Kickstarter goal is met.
 
The Kickstarter campaign goal will help produce the documentary as well as create the book in both hard copies and digital applications to be available to iBooks and Kindle. Please help us tell Lance's beauful story to the world.

663,Can we have a chat about education?,"So I work both as a teacher in an additional needs class and as a carer with a family whose son has autism and fragile-x syndrome.  Teaching kids with autism has taught me infinitely more about education and learning than working with mainstream kids ever did.  As a result, I have a real penchant for fun learning materials which incorporate problems/questions which are relevant to the interests of the child.

For example, one of the kids in my class is extremely interested in Pokemon.  He is dyscalculate, and just the sight of maths worksheets/textbooks is enough to cause him great stress/anxiety and will usually result in him throwing his pencils, storming out the class, and declaring that he's rather die than do maths.  In order to teach him maths, we give him challenges in the form of pokemon cards; 

""Raichu does a thunder attach on Squirtle which normally does **20 damage**.  Squirtle is weak to thunder so the attack does **double (x2)** damage.  
a) How much damage did the attack do?  
b)  If Squirtle started with 60HP, how much HP would he have after the attack?  
c)  If Ash used a potion on Squirtle, which restored 30HP, how much HP would Squirtle have now?""

The family I work with have a kid in a special unit in a mainstream school.  He has been there for four years and cannot add numbers up to 20.  He loves to send and receive mail, he loves to help people do tasks, and he loves Postman Pat.  As a result, he receives a letter ""from Postman Pat"" each week, where Postman Pat asks for his help completely his sums.  We have simple challenges; ""Pat had 6 letters left over from yesterday, he picked up 7 at the office this morning, how many letters does Pat have to deliver today?""  He receives this letter, does the sums, puts it in an envelope, we address it and put on a stamp, and we walk to the post box and ""send it back to Pat"".

Anyway, I'd love to have people's input into what methods you've used to learn, or to help someone else learn?  I feel there's so much knowledge to be gained just from sharing stories about how other people have managed to overcome obstacles in learning.  Also, for parents whose kids are struggling, I have a whole bank of techniques that could help, so if you are looking for anything in particular, or are struggling with a certain area of your child's education, then feel free to ask.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1bq7if/can_we_have_a_chat_about_education/,501

669,Questions about diagnosing autism in toddlers.,"Hi r/autism. I am a parent of three kids, ages four, three, and one. My three-year-old son has several ""red flags"" of autism, and I have an appointment with our pediatrician for later this week. But before I go, I wanted to get some advice.

He just turned three a couple of weeks ago, and can be a funny, sweet little boy. But he is also prone to HUGE meltdowns, with a lot of physical aggression. When he gets this way, he HATES physical contact (and he's only somewhat tolerant of it most of the time, even on good days). He acts like we're physically harming him when we even reach to touch his shoulder, or brush the hair out of his eyes.

He tends to want to play by himself, and only regularly acknowledges other kids (his brother and sister are an occasional exception) if they have something he is interested in. Today, for example, we were at my cousin's funeral, and there were at least 20 other kids between 1 and 10 years old. He had no interest in playing with any of them at the reception following the service (they were all playing wonderfully in a big group), and instead spent an hour and a half having a meltdown, complete with screaming, sobbing, thrashing, and rolling on the floor. I know he's a three-year-old boy, and tantrums can be par for the course, but this seems excessive. And it's becoming increasingly common. He is speech delayed, so I'm not sure how much of his frustration is due to his inability to effectively communicate.

He tends to fixate on certain things and completely tone the world out, until he wants something and then he ensures (via tantrums or violence) that he gets our attention. He prefers to play alone with the same few toys day in and day out, and becomes overwhelmed when we break up daily routines. We like to take the kids to the zoo, museum, parks, or the river to play, and there are times when he handles these outings okay (even though he often goes off by himself), but they often result in complete meltdowns.

He has other possible, milder warning signs, which I'm not sure are related or indicative of a problem. He takes things very literally, so you have to be very specific if you tell him to do something. He's struggling severely with potty training, even though he shows interest in it. It's like he wants to do it, but doesn't understand how to recognize the physical cues of needing to ""go."" He has issues with different textures of fabric and food, and it's really hard to get him to eat- he was barely on the growth chart at his last doctor's appointment, and I'm not sure he'll even be on them when we go soon.

I'm not sure how much weight to give ANY of these behaviors, because of his age. I've been through terrible twos/threes with his older sister, so I know that a lot of this could just be extreme but normal toddler behavior. His sister was an early and advanced talker, so I think that contributed to her relatively ""easy"" toddler years. But even taking into consideration his toddler/preschooler status, his actions seem very extreme. The potty training and listening issues (he seriously seems deaf a lot of the time, and asking him to look at us when we're talking to him so we know he's paying attention elicits zero response, as he hates making eye contact unless it's to stare us down like he wants to strangle us), as well as several of these other issues, could just be normal (albeit fairly extreme) toddler angst. So I'm at a loss to determine how much of this could be indicative of a larger problem.

Does this brief glimpse at his behavior warrant a closer look, or am I just paranoid? We'll be going to the doctor regardless, but I want to know what to ask. I'll bring up all of these points, but if there are other things you noticed in your kids' early years that were indicators of autism, it'd be nice to know. Did you have trouble distinguishing between normal toddler actions and possible autistic signals? I'm just a bit lost and looking for advice. We were at the funeral Mass/cemetery/visitation for about 5 hours today, and I barely got to talk to anyone because he was only NOT throwing a fit for about 30 minutes of that. I saw several of my cousins' kids throw tantrums during that time, but nothing like what he was doing. That's how it is everywhere we go.

Oh, and in terms of disciplining kids with these behaviors... How exactly do you go about that? Taking away privileges seems to be the most effective, although it definitely warrants major meltdowns. But if there is a more effective solution, I'm all ears.

679,"Possibly autistic 14-year-old getting an ADOS in a couple of weeks for Asperger's, what should I expect?","Hello /r/autism.  First time poster, a few month lurker.



A little backstory:

My adventures with Autism started in preschool.  As my mom recounts, a preschool teacher/counselor/whatever told her that I may have Asperger's.  Because my mom did not trust ""preschool people"" with medical diagnoses, she ignored and never got me tested.  Throughout my schooling years, after going through speech therapy (IEP, completed goal in fourth or fifth grade) and gifted support (GIEP, note that I live in Pennsylvania) with social awkwardness and my obsession with computers, writing, and knowledge in general (thus why I am on Reddit and in Gifted) scattered in between.  I have gone through therapy in three or four rounds through my hospital system starting in around fifth grade, originally for ""uncontrollable anger"", my social awkwardness, and the such.  Recently, about a few months ago, my therapist loosely diagnosed me with depression, which a psychiatrist agreed and prescribed me Zoloft to help control my symptoms.  For those who care, I am doing wonderfully with the meds and with talk therapy; in other words, the clouds have parted and a new light has shined through.  That psychiatrist, while going through the initial examination, noted my various Asperger's-esque symptoms (if anything, most likely in the lower end of the spectrum) and referred me to a Psy.D. to go through an ADOS.



Now into the important stuff:

In about a week or so, my mom will go through her interview with the developmental stuff, and a week after that, I will go in for an ADOS.  I have read that the ADOS, when used in younger children, is based among observations with play.  As a teenager, playing with toys does not appeal to me, and as my therapist has told me, the ADOS will probably be a questionnaire of some sort.  Although I understand that every psychologist is different, as a teenager, what should I expect from this ADOS?  Thank you for your advice and, if a diagnosis comes through, you may be seeing more of me in the future!

682,Has anyone been able to transfer their child's school?,"My son started kindergarten this year and within 2 months, we ended up pulling him out of school because there were signs he was being molested by his one on one aid. We had no proof so the principal refused to do anything about it, so we did what we felt was best to protect our son. 

I have been homeschooling him ever since, but it has been very slow going because everything distracts him and because I'm Mom he doesn't seem compelled to try. My husband and I both feel it would be best for him to go back to school this fall, but since the person who molested him still works at his old school, we need a new school. The problem is that we are just barely outside of the town boundaries. We still live in the town but are considered out of district. There is only one school in our outlying district, the one we pulled our son from. 

The town has 22 elementary schools and a ""life skills"" program that my son's developmental pediatrician highly recommends. We rent, so we could move but my son is epileptic as well and we just got his seizures under control. Another move could throw him all out of whack, so we want to avoid that. Plus, by renting out in the country we are able to provide him with a large yard to play in on a quiet road which is safer for him (he is just learning to be aware of road dangers).

I don't have a problem paying a fee for him to go to a school in the town district, but I don't know if they would accept him because of his needs. He receives outside speech and occupational therapy that our insurance pays for, so I'd be fine with signing a waiver stating that they don't have to provide that for him. He is pretty high functioning and doesn't necessarily need a one on one if he is in a classroom with a good teacher/student ratio, which the life skills program provides. 

If it helps, I have a younger child that will be starting kindergarten this fall and would be transferring her as well. My questions are two fold, have you ever transferred your child to another district? Do you have any experience with school programs designed for children with high functioning autism/other high functioning disorders?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1b5guk/has_anyone_been_able_to_transfer_their_childs/,185

Wraparound worked great for about a year and a half. His original TSS quit to go back to school, the second (and best) moved to another county, and his BSC/MT for that whole time moved to another office. 

Then, we had a bout with a TSS that totally clashed personalities with my son. Now we have a young male TSS, whom I like a lot, but it just doesn't seem to be working anymore.

My son feels like a slave to the wraparound. It's become 3 nights a week of tantrums, defiance and threats. The activities created for him are fine, but the whole idea of sacrificing 3 nights fills him (and me) with anxiety. 

He could have a wonderful day, but the minute there's a knock on the door, Mr. Hyde shows up. I feel embarrassed and helpless.

This will be a MAPS-sponsored collaborative study between Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and the Stanford University School of Medicine. Social anxiety is prevalent in autistic adults, and often compounds the considerable social challenges faced by autistic adults. The main objective of this study is to collect data on the safety of MDMA-assisted therapy in autistic adults, and to use standard clinical measures to estimate the extent to which MDMA-assisted therapy may reduce social anxiety symptoms in this group. Even though we did attempt to obtain external funding from a private foundation, our letter of intent was rejected. [Please consider donating to help complete this study](http://maps.org/donate).

I have seen completely legitimate responses, suggestions and general feedback on some very important and valuable comments buried to oblivion leaving it up to the user to search and travel to get to the meat and bones of the comment.  
My ultimate goal here as a moderator is to provide users with a valid and valuable place to come and seek information, idea's and more importantly, support. It is obvious to me, as I have been using this site for well over 5 years, that people do not follow guidelines and use the voting system properly. On a smaller scale, we as a group and I as a moderator can alter or better our little slice of the reddit pie. I have reached out to the /r/ before in asking for feedback on what you think. That is the purpose of this post. I would like plus and negatives to make it so that you can NOT downvote comments. All reporting of spam and vulgar postings would still apply and removal of trolling for emotional comments from others will not be tolerated. I would rely on users to help me with this, as they currently do. Tell me what you think, or if I am just trying to reinvent the wheel.  

On a different note, I have noticed a great increase in the trolling accounts and the ban list for this subreddit is growing much larger in the last few months. There have been large groups and whole /r/'s that dedicate themselves to trolling other /r/'s and the users to instigate arguments and emotional responses. I personally go through MANY posts and comments just to keep an eye out for these ""people"" so I can protect others from the horrid things they say. Most of the time I catch them, but some slip through. I'm sorry if you or your post was bitten. Again, help me or the other mod's by reporting them. Use your judgement and I will do my best to keep it under control. If you can message the mod's, that would be helpful as well. If its painfully obvious as to the violation, no need to tell us.

I know we've got the best intentions, as do the parents/guardians/teachers/etc. asking for help, but dispensing anything other than passing suggestions are a violation of APA ethics guidelines.

This includes: suggesting changes to IEPs, suggesting the implementation of IEPs, suggesting any form of advice specific to one individual or groups of individuals.

Those of you with autistic members in your life: your greatest assets are the professionals working with your individual.  Despite the best of intentions, advice given over the internet, or by people who do not know your individual, is possibly risky.  BCBAs, BCaBAs and other credited professionals are violating their code of ethics by giving out advice; even though the possibility of legal consequence is miniscule, there may very well be consequences.

When doctors and lawyers post information online, it is almost always prefaced with ""I am not acting as your counsel; do not interpret this information as such.""  This extends to any and all APA professionals.

At the very least, we should strive to make the distinction between professional and non-professional advice.  Parents et. al, remember: no matter how intelligent this community may be, it will always be hampered by the fact that we cannot, and should not, know the individual in question.

Autistic people are often times more empathetic than non-autistics.  Autistic people can and do fall in love and get hurt just as easily as any other human being.

I don't know what love is, wouldn't know it if I felt it, I really kind of don't care about having more than one or two close friends and even them I don't see very often, I do occasionally joke around but most other people don't understand my sense of humor at all and a ton of stuff that most people think is funny I just find utterly stupid..I've been accused plenty of times of not having a sense of humor...I also apparently don't know how to smile but thats another issue altogether, while I am function in my day to day life and get by just fine I couldn't ever really funtion as a normal part of society, I hate people, crowds and talking too much for that. I can't hold a job, I'm very hard to get along with. 

So now that these lists are starting to give me a new complex to worry about I'm wondering if there are autistic people like me out there somewhere.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1a5tp3/fitting_the_stereotypes/,420

718,Educational program for teaching 3D modeling and computer skills to kids with autism looking for support,"Hi /autism. My parents are professors at the University of Utah who organize a program called iSTAR that tries to meet the needs of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder in a way that traditional education does not—building on their visual-spatial strengths. The iSTAR program began in 2009 in conjunction with Google’s Project Spectrum (now Trimble) when Google developers realized that children with ASD enjoyed using SketchUp and had a gift for 3D modeling. Since then, the iSTAR team at the University of Utah has worked to develop a curriculum that not only creates employable computer skills but also provides a bonding experience that allow real friendships to form around mutual interests. In addition to these peer friendships, studies have shown that iSTAR program also helps improve the relationships between youth and their siblings, parents, and grandparents. 

Currently, my parents are trying to find funding on RocketHub so that they can expand their program into other communities. Personally, I think what they are doing is pretty cool so I thought I would do my part to help spread the word. Any support you could give would be great!

I recieved an email today with an update and it seems things are improving for this young boy.

This was such a devastating story. I still get a bit upset going over what happened and thinking about how it has impacted this boy. Will the damage done be irreversible? Even if he bounces back how long will it take? I just wanted to share this in case someone might be interested. The charges against the boy were already dropped but he was still not allowed to return to school because he had had in his possession and sold drugs on school grounds.

720,"Moral dilemma, advice needed: to walk or not to walk","WARNING: I'm going to be talking about the dreaded AS, please hear me out. I'm not a fan of them and that's really where the problem lies.

One of the women that has helped me most with handling my son's diagnosis from another mom's pov, asked me to join her team for AS and in a moment of awkwardness I said I would. I didn't want to hurt her feeling or upset her, she sees it more as a time to help her son than support their ""company."" She's been doing it for years so I don't think telling her all the stuff I've learned since being on here would do much, if she doesn't already know it. 

I thought at first I would simply support the awareness and not fund raise and wear shirts about acceptance on the day etc. But now she wants us to join in fund raising and come to invites and I don't know what is expected and what morally I can handle. I can't stomach giving money to people who want to cure something that isn't wrong with my kid but I don't want to hurt a friend when she's always been there with a kind word. I've thought about being sick on the day or not being able to go but the fund raising is really the part that's the worst for me. Please I'd love some advice.

722,Going to the ER al0ne for the first time...,"And I'm scared. Really, rediculously scared. So scared letting my wisdom tooth grow into my jaw joint really doesn't seem all that bad, in conparison. I hate doctors, I hte hospitals, I hate the public transport I have to take there. I can't speak well enough to hold a conversation.

A trip to the hospital usually goes like this: 'name' *goes in little room, hands over little statement clarifying situation attached to insurance info, waits* 'Please rate your pain' 'I can't' *friend/family explains I really can't, nurse gets agitated, I melt down, friend talks nurse out of sending me to psychiatric, nurse makes up a number* Scenarios like this continue the whole time. People keep trying to talk to me, ask questions I quite literally can't answer, and everytime it has been an absolute miracle for me to actually make it through to getting care and beyond a miracle they let me leave at the end.

I don't know what to do. I don't even know where to begin, it'd take me a week or more to prepare for even the bus ride, and I've only got a few days. I normally get through by letting myself seem like a scared little kid, but I have to seem competant to be seeking my own health care. I do not want to end up trapped in psychiatric or ruled incompetant. I'm not. I may be 'officially low functioning', but I'm not dumb or incompetant, no matter how I appear under stress.

723,"During my son's IEP they tried to label him ""intellectually disabled.""","My son is 5 years old, diagnosed with autism.  He is not verbal, therefore they do not consider him high-functioning.  He is a very loving, and intelligent little man.
He is going to be transitioning him into a structured Kindergarten class in the fall.

During his most recent IEP the school psychologist said that she would like to add intellectually disabled (the new term for mentally retarded) to his diagnosis.  

The school psychologist sees him maybe 30 minutes a month.  The tests that she preforms ask him to do tasks for example ""put on your shoes"" if he does not do it, he gets a zero.  He can put on his shoes, he is capable of it, but he is not going to always do it on command.
I am not trying to knock psychology, but not everything is so black and white.  

His teacher, along with everybody who works daily with him, entirely disagreed.  I asked if he would get more help, and how his services would change.  The school district employees assured me that it would not change his services.  

I thought about it and was worried that if he was labeled 'I.D.' that they wouldn't give him the same treatment that they would a child with just a diagnosis of autism.  I was concerned that they would just think ""this is as far as he will go"".  His teachers, speech therapist, occupational therapist all have high hopes he will speak, and be a successful high functioning person.

Has this happened to any of you other parents out there?  What was your reaction.  Parents who went along with the diagnosis (I had it removed from his IEP) what was the outcome?  I asked that he be re-tested in 3 years and if they come up with the same results and he has not improved, I will accept the diagnosis.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/19zi6y/during_my_sons_iep_they_tried_to_label_him/,410
724,A tendency toward discouragement and withdrawal,"Now bipolar NOS is not the only thing I've had. As a kid I had ADHD, PDD-NOS, and conduct disorder, and was in special ed. As a teenager I had Asperger's syndrome and even a psychotic break--though I've since gotten much better.

Anyway, I've recently noticed something that has been a pattern for all of my life. Basically, I'm transgender and I do support transgender issues, but I've recently become frustrated over the lack of access to SRS. I've been volunteering at the local LGBT community center, but to be honest I had not been doing much with these past few months. I was given an assignment by our coordinator, but anger about lack of SRS surfaced and I at the same time began to feel very discourage over the work. After a week of basically doing nothing, I told the coordinator I quit and that I was no good to have as a volunteer. Every time I think about it, I have this burning pain in my stomach--I feel a lot of my emotions through my stomach.

I've had this pattern all my life, going back to childhood. Is this the bipolar, or is it something else?

729,My three year old is autistic from this day forth,"So....

yeah. My beautiful, mischievous and incredibly puzzling boy is now on the spectrum somewhere, supposedly. He's been doing great this week. He's finally getting the hang of toilet training, realizing that he doesn't have to be buck ass naked to drop a deposit in the commode. 6 peepee stickers on the chart earned from multiple spaces. Today was a good day, Dun dun Dun. Then we got to the psychologist office.

I've known my little frogman has not been developing like a typical child for quite sometime. He came into the earth two weeks early and got jammed in the canal along the way. Then he was cut out of me all bruised but a mighty sucker. He would go on the nurse another 18 months. I miss the cure all of the powerful ninny. It was around this weaning age we realized he had a delay in speech development. He'd mastered about 10 words by the time he turned 2. That's when this mama freaked out and started looking for help.

I got him an assessment through our state's program, a screening at the local autism center, a meeting with his old neurologist from frogman's mysterious bout of staring spells that cleared up just before a rigmarole of testing to find their cause. And finally frogman met with a speech language pathologist who accessed his skills to be at the lowest end of average.

So we got frogman speech therapy for a year. The year is up and she says he needs more. We tried a different route this time and went straight to a psychologist. She didn't impress me but I think she's right. Frogman is on the spectrum. I broke down on the drive home and wailed through 6 lanes of traffic. Frogman sat in the back oddly quite but occasionally commenting on his precious cars bestowed upon him after exiting the doctor's office. 

So now here were are a year later with a diagnosis we suspected a year ago. I've spent the past 6 hours reading about autism and therapies. Trying to find all of our options. Frogman is a talker, a repeater, a big singer, and swimmer and some of the things add up. Like him calling every tall dirty blonde guy in the grocery store daddy. Or when Frogman first learned his cousin's names Lerp and Derp. All little girls were Lerps and Derps for a while. He used to confuse Aunt Ray with Baby Boon. When he saw Queen Latifa in a movie he exclaimed praise to Ms. Shorenay his preschool teacher. I had no idea that facial recognition had anything to do with autism.

Frogman does not know he is a man. He can say penis. Today when he was drawing a face he drew a big circle, added eyes, added a nose, added arms, added legs, added a neck and chin. Then of course he said, let's add a penis and so he drew two long ones on either side of the neck.

Well, frogman has arisen from his slumber for a midnight cuddle with mom. He is demanding yogurt drink with reversed pronouns so I must go. Any advice here on how to raise up my strange creature to be a healthy and happy being? Any personal anecdotes? What about school? He's in a normal school now running circles around everyone but being well loved. His speech therapist says more structure would be key as he is in a montessori school currently. I want him in a normal school but I'm afraid the private schools will not want him with the ASD label.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/19p23f/my_three_year_old_is_autistic_from_this_day_forth/,542

My wife started a new job last year that is seasonal, her work ending in December. While she still received some income through unemployment while laid off it was not enough to pay the bills through the winter. We made it through January and February by selling unnecessary household items, while I contracted out work for some odd jobs. While rent was paid, it was unfortunately paid late. Our lease is up at the end of March, and our landlord stated that if the rent is paid late again this month they will not be renewing our lease or allow us to stay until we are ready to leave. We are not financially ready to move, none the less be forced out, and will have no where to go.

My wife returned to work on February 25th and all will be well at the end of this month when she receives her paycheck, however, this does not help us pay rent for the month of March on time.We are continuing to do what we can on our end to handle this but are also reaching out for any monetary assistance that can be provided. Any funding that can be donated is gratefully appreciated and we will also consider any loans that could be provided. We would be happy to trade work for monetary compensation. I am an autistic person and have a strong ability to design systems and engineer solutions to various problems as well as improve existing systems for efficiency.

732,Exploring my tentative autism diagnosis,"When I was a child, probably under the age of five during the mid 90's in Canada, I was labeled as ""possibly autistic."" I only know this as hearsay from my mom, who never really talked about it until I had asked her, when I found a document in our house outlining autism. I again, became really curious when reading Donna Williams' ""Somebody Somewhere."" As a child I was late to speak, had a speech impediment, and hearing difficulties (ingrown ear) and growing up having a difficult time socially. Having social difficulties has transcended to today, I am 21 and studying social work, coincidentally. The topic of autism has intrigued me and when reading about it, I can make some connections, social difficulties, math difficulties, highly intelligent in some areas, and not in others (anyone could generalize with this). What speaks to me, is finding the self, and the social fopaws I experience. Nowadays, I work hard at being more social and outgoing; I even have an internship with people who have developmental disabilities. My question is, do any of you share something similar like this. Is it worth the idea of exploring a diagnosis? I do feel if I was labeled (something I am highly adverse to) that I would had more educational and social supports which I needed.

He also has huge problems with frustration and meltdowns. One thing we have always noticed is that he calms right down around animals and so we would love to get him an autism service dog.

These dogs are trained to sense agitation in these kids and calm them down by placing pressure on them, allowing the child to focus on them to help them relax, help them stay out of dangerous situations like preventing them from stepping out into the street, etc. We think the benefits for him would be huge!

I don't know these people, besides waving at them when I'm walking by. I've met the kid once and he seemed fine, he just showed me his skateboard and went off to play. 

For the past month or so the boy has been out in their backyard, just standing there yelling ""fuck you"" and ""bitch"" OVER AND OVER in a really angry voice. Sometimes he will do it for like an hour and I can hear it inside my house with the windows shut. His parents are home but I rarely hear them say anything to him, although once I heard his mom quietly ask him to stop, but he didn't. She said ""if you don't stop, you can't go to the park"" and he said ""really? I want to go to the park!"".. Stopped for a few minutes and started up again. (FYI I saw them take him to the park later that day).

A friend of mine suggested that perhaps he is autistic, she said that repeating phrases, especially ""bad"" ones, is common. Is this true? If so.. what should I do, if anything? I feel bad for the parents, because I'm sure it must be extremely stressful to deal with, but I'm also not too keen on listening to a kid yell ""fuck you"" over and over when I'm trying to relax. I want to be sensitive to their needs but I mean... it's really awful. Does anyone have any advice?

740,"I am writing a series of books addressing social skills, tailored to a child's perspective. What topics would you like to see addressed?","Hi /r/autism!



I have been doing intensive early intervention with children with ASDs for over ten years now.




One thing that has always struck me is that there is a lack of social skills materials aimed at children that truly speak to a child's experience and perspective. A lot of the literature available for children seems to have the same ""do not do this, because you should not."", or it talks dow to the target audience. 




As such, I am writing my own series. One that takes a child's perspective into account. One that treats the child as a person, and explains things in a way that makes sense to them. 




I have written a few already, which are in the process of being edited and illustrated. I know a number of topics that I would like to address, but it is much more valuable to me to know what topics YOU would like to see addressed. There is no better input than that of parents, professionals, and individuals on the spectrum.





I won't disclose which ones have already been done, and which ones are in the works, because I'd rather see an unbiased comparison of how my target topics align with yours.




I hope to get these published, but if I cannot, I will be publishing them independently and distributing them myself. I believe that these books can be an extremely valuable ressource.

744,"Hi! We are Autistry Studios, a prevocational program that helps to promote the growth of independence in ASD youth. ","Autistry Studios is a non-profit organization in Marin County, California. We work with the ASD population ages 14-early 40s in the context of experiential workshops. These workshops help to improve real world functioning, as well as cultivate communicative and social skills. 

The workshops begin with an exploration of interests: what does the student really like to do, read about or dream of creating? Individuals on the Autistic Spectrum often have difficulty applying themselves to tasks in which they have no personal interest. In school they excel in some classes and fail at others. Their success rate is directly proportional to their interest.

Paradoxically, individuals on the Spectrum can have difficulty making progress on tasks which they find very interesting due to issues of self regulation – managing excitement, handling their own distractibility, etc. We encourage students to fully explore their interests and we assist them in learning new skills and coping strategies that will allow them to successfully pursue those interests. The process also provides them with greater insight into their own strengths and weaknesses as workers and students and allows them to take action to remediate some of their weaknesses.

Rather than mandating social interactions or creating artificial social situations, we facilitate naturally occurring interactions and conversations in the context of Autistry Studios activities. The longer workshop sessions and the meal break help create a friendly, comfortable environment where students feel more at ease expressing themselves. After a few weeks the students begin to initiate conversations on topics of interest to them and they discover that others share their interests. This discovery of commonality is the beginning of the creation of a social cohort. We encourage the students to stay in contact with each other outside of the workshops.

Because Autistry Studios is not for profit, there are times where we are seriously struggling to keep our organization afloat. We would like to expand and really reach this population, especially within this age group. Please support Autistry Studios by making any kind of donation you can. It would be greatly appreciated.

749,How to handle my son running into the street.,"Hello, I'm new here and this is my first post. My son (2 1/2 yo) was just diagnosed with mild autism about two weeks ago. We're still in the process of getting evaluated and getting insurance to cover therapy, but in the mean time, my wife and I are trying to learn as many skills as we can to better communicate with and support our son.

The technique that I've found most effective (I picked it up from one of the evaluators) is to narrate feelings. When he gets upset, I start asking ""are you mad?"", ""are you upset?"", ""are you hungry?"", ""are you hurt?"", etc. and that often helps him calm down when I identify what's bothering him.

The major issue that we have right now is that sometimes he'll have a tantrum (often because we've said 'no' to something) where he runs into a place he's not supposed to go in order to get us to chase him (hell look back to make sure we're following him). In the house he runs to the kitchen or the bathroom, which is an issue but a comparatively minor one. The problem is that when we're outdoors, he has a tendency to run into the street or parking lots. Obviously, this is terrifying for us.

Once we get into regular therapy we hope that the professionals can help us with this, but while we're in insurance limbo, we're hoping you have some advice for us. Obviously the #1 thing is to catch and restrain him to prevent injury, but once that happens what do I do?

I've tried (in various combinations):
1) restraining him in place in the hopes that he'll calm down (he hates being held against his will so much that I don't think he would ever calm down).
2) calmly asking him what's upsetting him and trying to narrate my way to the solution.
3) gently telling him his behavior is not acceptable.
4) raising my voice to tell him his behavior is not acceptable.
5) Carrying him, kicking and screaming, to the car/house/shopping cart.
6) Figuring out what he's upset about and fixing it.

1-4 basically never work.
5 is often the only safe way to get him out of the situation, but it's not always available if I'm carrying other things or we're with my 4yo daughter
6 is very effective if I can figure out the problem and it's something that can be immediately addressed. but often that's not possible. It also in some cases leads me down the road of abandoning rules and boundaries to accommodate his behavior, and that's a danger area I want to be really careful with.

If anyone has other suggestions, we would greatly appreciate it.  One other aspect that's relevant is that he is language delayed by about a year, so he's on an 18 month speaking and comprehension level.

This post is not meant for financial gain or blatant self-promotion. I'm genuinely curious if this helps fellow ""disordered"" as well and if/where there's room for improvement.

It's hosted on Bandcamp for easy access and the opportunity to download it. Even though the download link states ""Buy now"" it's ""pay what you want"" without any attachments (such as providing an e-mail address). See it merely as an optional tip jar.
Unfortunately free downloads are limited to 200/month (Bandcamp's choice, not mine). If I run out of those and there's still interest in free downloads I'll upload a copy somewhere else. 

And if you're going to download it, please select a lossless codec and not MP3 unless you like shitty compression and missing frequencies. I didn't upload a 200+ MB wav-file for nothing. ;)


**Actual, hopefully interesting, content of the post**

I've been experimenting with random elements in music and rendered a track which is almost fully randomised. I found out that this helped me focus: it drowns out background noises, but doesn't have melodies or ""hooks"" to catch your attention. I wonder if this is the case for others as well.

Here's the link:

http://soundsofolympusmons.bandcamp.com/track/third-render-in-c-major

If you notice that something peeves you in it, please write it in the comments.

The ""second render"" (previous track generated with same settings) is almost 80 minutes (so burnable on a 700MB CD-R). If anyone is interested in that, please say so in the comments and I'll make sure it'll be available for download.

If anyone has a request for a modified track, feel free to post so. The ""composition"" (for a lack of a better word) is done on the fly by my computer (the project name is the computers network name), but I'm able to influence most aspects of it, such as sound, time, key, rhythm, etc.


By the way: the track is under the [CC BY-NC 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) license. You're pretty much free to do with it what you like, as long as it's non-commercial, credits the project-name and isn't used in hatred (the only ""moral right"" I'll use).

759,Writing a character with autism in a premodern society--Need Help!,"Hello! I'm an aspiring author and I'm writing a story about a premodern society in central Alaska. I'm hoping to write one of the characters as autistic, but need help. 

Some background about me: I have a high-functioning cousin that I've always been very close with. Experiences with him made me think that instead of high-functioning autism being a 'bad thing' or a 'disorder' as many seem to think of it, it's just a specific personality type, and it fills one of the many irreplaceable roles which a society needs to function. I have always believed that a high-functioning autistic person would not only fit in great with a small, premodern society, but would be a really helpful asset. For example, my cousin has an incredible ability to do impressions of people's voices, which is an extremely useful skill in a premodern society because of their close interactions with birds (especially bird calls) and other animals in nature. He also has a fantastic memory, especially for stories, which is the main method of communicating information in hunter-gatherer societies. And of course, he has extremely strong morals and an unflinching positive attitude even in the face of terrible difficulties, which is honestly pretty rare in the modern world.

I want to make a character which has mannerisms that will identify them as being on the spectrum, but nothing too obvious. I also am interested in any special skills or assets that you have noticed of people on the spectrum. It would also be helpful if you could think of possible discussion topics or interests which could apply to people from 100,000 years ago just as much as they would to people today.

Edit: The character I'm writing is a girl, around age 25-35. I have no idea if that would affect anything.

**tl;dr I am an aspiring author and would like to write a character with ASD which is an asset to the group of hunter-gatherers that they live with. Please help me think of more useful talents they could have, some conversation topics they would mention, and mannerisms which could subtly identify them as being on the spectrum.

He always seemed a bit off to me, not very social, looks down when he speaks, has trouble expressing ideas, but he is very gift in engineering type activities/physics. He doesn't have any friends at school, but he does well academically. His parents pay little to no attention to him because they are always working 7 days a week to make ends meet. 

After reading about autism, I really think he may have some moderate form of it. I've tried bringing it up with my husband many times, and he just denies and denies. I think lately he may have started observing what I see...to some extent, but just barely. I've tried to push him to bring it up with his parents but he refuses because he thinks they won't accept that something could be ""wrong"" (his words) with his brother.

765,I was diagnosed this week. I have some questions.,"Apparently my entire post is too long and I can only post the TL;DR here. Then again, the long version is mostly just incoherent babble anyway. 

Full text: http://pastebin.com/evMDWx34


TL;DR
 
- I'm 19.
- I'm sure that I have ADHD. Tried about a dozen drugs that didn't work for me. Could autism be an
explanation for why this is? (ex. I'm still very fidgety, can't focus, can't sit down, always
walking/jumping about)
- I was diagnosed with autism this week. Doctor only saw me two times, and also had two appointments with my mother. His diagnosis seems reasonable, though.
- What should I know about autism?
- What can I do about my sensitivity to light? (computer monitor, fluorescent light for my room.)
- I only have very limited interests and practically zero motivation outside of that. None of these interests can really get me a job. How will I manage the future?  (Strangely enough, I find many little, odd things rather charming and nice, but nothing like the obsessive, devouring autism-fuelled interests. These minor interests are basically just for the present, ex. Seeing a low hanging fog and remarking on the scene, even though I'm probably alone.)
- My day to day thoughts and daydreams are EXTREMELY repetitive and dull. Games, computers, girls, sex, making a magic deck, ""winning"" in a game, theorycrafting in a game, general vague thoughts about destruction and death, if something ""sucks"" or is ""good"". Is this typical for autism? What can I do about it?
 
Another big issue: I feel like my brain hits a ceiling in college. Even in high school, for grade 10 math &amp; science, I found it extremely difficult to wrap my head around the concepts. In college, I find it very difficult to follow biology, with all the information that is related to other information previously taught, that is related to more etc. I find it hard to follow logic in philosophy (as much as I love the class.) I find programming exceedingly painful to do, though my friend managed to teach me a bit. I simply find any thinking beyond trivially simple to be abhorrently difficult. What can I do about this? I feel as if I should be intelligent and at least good at something; my brain can be very quick. I don't feel dumb but if I'm intelligent, it simply doesn't seem to manifest in anything practical. I feel almost as if the autism diagnosis is both a relief and a sorrow... that a lot of what I can't achieve academically, my lack of motivations could be strongly attributed to autism, but it also makes me completely hopeless about the future, as none of my autism-obsessive interests are useful for a job. Nothing seems to make sense, except maybe arts courses, in which everything you need to know is basically common sense. Course, a degree in arts would totally get you places...

My 4y7m old nephew was recently diagnosed by the school district as falling under the autism umbrella which allows them to provide him services.

I was hoping I could get advice here as far as books/websites/etc that I can read myself (I am very involved in my nephews life, a surrogate mother is what my brother calls me since mom isn't as involved, they are still married) and that maybe I can provide for my brother to help him learn more about what is going on.

771,"Just discovered ""stimming"". So this is what that weird thing I do is called!","My heart is beating so fast. I first remember doing this when I was 4/5. I would watch Aladdin over and over, I loved it. What I loved the most was the magic and the lights and the patterns of cloud, sparkles etc (funnily enough I'm gay lol). I would want more of it in a different form, so I would sit there and squirm around, shaking my legs around and sort of flapping my arms. I would completely zone out and would just be consumed by my own imagination, only coming back to the room if I needed more inspiration or just got tired and hot. I used to ask my mum if I could do it when we were at family gatherings, and once my mum and my aunty spied on me doing it and were laughing. Ever since then I've done it in private, sort of like masturbation, and still do it now once a month or so. For me it's always inspired by magic and bright lights: Pokemon, Digimon, Harry Potter etc. Just to clarify, that is what this is, right?

772,I suspect I might have a form of Autism. ,"I'm 31. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but now I'm wondering if I have been suffering from an autism spectrum disorder since I was a child, and nobody picked up on it then. 

Since I was a kid I used the turn my head back and forth whenever I got excited, especially when I listened to music. I still do it, although now I've trained myself to only do it when no one's looking, whenever my mom sees me doing it, she tells me to stop. I also remember in elementary school, I used to rock back and forth to the point that everyone in the class noticed. When I became a teenager I started to play with my knuckles, pinching them and sometimes chewing on them, the more stressed out, the worse it got. Even when it hurt, I'd still continue to do it. I've always been a little weird and introverted. When I was a kid, I'd interact with other kids at school, but as I got older I started becoming more withdrawn. I've also had problems paying attention, I remember in grade 4 my teacher would constantly call me out for not paying attention. 

All this being said, perhaps some of this was just developmental stuff, although the head rocking and knuckle manipulation still remain. Now I'm wondering if the anxiety and depression is just a by-product of some bigger problem, caused by my inability to cope with ""normal"" life. 

I've also noticed as I've gotten older that my father exhibits some Aspergerish behaviour. He seems to not pick up on a lot of social cues, he also says stuff that can be hurtful, but he doesn't seem to realize what he said might be insulting or offensive. 

I just wanted to get that off my chest and tell someone. When I bring it up with my mom she acts like I'm crazy. Has anyone else had the head/body rocking?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/18ehdz/i_suspect_i_might_have_a_form_of_autism/,574

To interject the one opinion I have, in case it helps anyone: I have a couple of students who have the iGuy case, and I would NOT recommend it for kids who don't have great dexterity.  I'm trying to avoid kids dragging their hands on the iPad when tapping in Proloquo2go, and this case makes that really difficult.  It won't stay standing if you tap it, but if you lie it flat with the feet towards you it slopes away from you (really difficult to prompt tapping), if you turn it it's still not sloped enough to make any difference.

Have a 19 month old boy waiting to be evaluated with EI and developmental peds, I got some amazing feedsack from the parenting subreddit before I realized this subreddit existed.

We live in a small town.  We have EI services, but no developmental pediatrician.  We're traveling 1.5 hours to meet with the developmental ped, and I realize if they want to do therapies in conjunction with EI, we're probably going to be traveling 1.5 hours each way, several times a week.

This is all fine, I stay at home and watch him, and we'll do anything necessary.  But what I'm really wondering is, parents whose kids have aged out of EI at 3, did you do developmental preschool?  Is it location based like a regular school district or how does it work?  We don't have anything remotely like that in our area, and we'd be looking at a 1.5 hour drive again to get him in something like that. 

My husband and I are open to the idea of moving to the city to accommodate him, but we need to basically make a pretty fast decision if we do.  Homes in our area just don't sell in the winter and they tend to sit on the market a while.

Any of you guys live in a rural area?  The school district here is quite good and once I talk to the EI folks, I'll have a better indication of what they can do for him once he's school aged, but looking at years 3-5 is where I'm kind of fuzzy.

We caught it early, and she's doing quite well, all things considered. She's semi-verbal (she can request and label stuff, though has problems with pronoun reversal), and generally a happy, affectionate, child.

We're having a serious problem with some of the typical ""little kid"" stuff she does, and her complete lack of care for authority or consequences is making it impossible. 

Take mornings, for example. She knows exactly what the routine is. We get up, eat breakfast, get dressed, and go to daycare/work. Some mornings are alright, but most are completely horrible. She'll eat most of her breakfast, and then run off to play. When I ask if it's time to get dressed, she runs back to her breakfast and pretends that she's going to eat. The second I turn my back to go about my routine, she's off again. The same thing happens with getting dressed. She'll even go as far as say, getting her pants half on, but when I leave to go do my stuff, I'll come back to find her completely undressed again. I literally have to stand over her every second, and even then she goes so painfully slow. 

This sort of behaviour extends to the rest of her life. She lies about anything and everything if she thinks it will help her get what she wants (like saying she needs to go to the bathroom if I'm about to put her in timeout for hitting the dog). I know it's normal to be deceptive and difficult. I remember doing it myself.

Anyone have any personal experience being in a relationship with someone who has high functioning autism, maybe some advice on how to deal with certain frustrations. I don't want to change him, I would just like to understand him more and help reduce any frustrations that I feel and challenges that he might have.


I became friens with a guy last summer and I started to feel attracted to him four months ago.One of the reasons why I started to become attracted to him is because I find him so different compared to other people. He is so shy and timid to the point that I invited him to my place for thanksgiving dinner, and he was uncomfortable about coming because there was a chance that my roommates were going to be there. I first suggested that I'll invite some of my other friends over who he hasn't met, and he initially said that he's way too shy to do that. He's told me that he often has a hard time getting out of his comfort zone, and can spend the day in his room (he often spends his Saturdays by himself in his room). He has spent months in his room when he's not at school or at work, and he has to keep telling himself to get out of his bedroom. He told me shortly after we met that he gets along a lot better with dogs than with people, and it seems like complicated things escape him.

He's also very timid and admitted to me that he has some self confidence issues. He loves listening to music, he can play the clarinet and guitar, but visual arts are lost on him. I'm a visual artist myself and he clearly doesn't appreciate my work when I show it to him, which is not a big deal to me, I don't take it personally. But at least most people who see my work will tell me how much they like it, even if they think that they have no artistic bone in their body.

I told him that I was attracted to him back in November, and that made things more complicated. I told him that if he doesn't feel the same then he can just tell me and I won't be angry at him or upset because I want us to be honest with each other and I still value his friendship, so I want to continue being friends regardless if he feels the same way or not. He hasn't given me a reply to that. The only thing that he has told me is that he's only had one romantic relationship in his life and that it was such a long time ago that he doesn't know how to act when someone likes him.
It seems like he at least still wants to be friends, but he has not told me about his feelings at all. He said that he has a hard time explaining how he feels, especially since his maternal language is french and I'm still learning french (we mainly communicate in english). I have found it very frustrating in dealing with him because there have been times where I have opened myself up to him about my feelings and he doesn't know how to react. Another time I was really upset because I found out that I have a severe kidney disease, I sent him a message telling him about it, and he didn't even respond to it. He also doesn't always pick up on jokes that I make, or when I'm playfully teasing him.

He also seems to get fixated on certain things, mainly his work and studies, he can talk to me about it for hours.It seems like he'd rather just hang out with me and no one else when we hang out. He doesn't seem to care for large groups of people. I feel like he's been sending me mixed messages as to whether or not he likes me as a friend or more, which has just left me confused. And he often seems aloof most of the time, and can't pick up on subtleties. One time we were laying on his bed together, watching youtube videos on his laptop, I put my arm around him and he did nothing. He didn't try and push me away, nor did he try to do anything more. He invited me to his place another time for supper, I picked him up from his office, so he was already dressed appropriately, but when he got home he decided to change into a tighter, nicer shirt that showed more of his chest and arms. But when I make a move on him he kind of freezes, like he doesn't know what to do.

He seems to prefer to keep things pretty private, he mainly has a facebook profile for `professional` reasons, mainly only posting links related to his field of study. He used to have two photos of himself but has since taken them down. He keeps his friends list private

I've talked with a friend who's studying psychology and they told me that he might have some form of autism. I know that the label can get thrown around a lot, and I don't want to just label him with that. I can't really talk with him about it because he seems to shut down when conversations turn serious, plus I don't think that it would be very productive to bring it up.

What I would like to know, is that if he does have some form of autism, how do I interact with him? I mean, I want to at least stay friends with him, but I often get frustrated with him because he'll often seem aloof. How could I approach him if I want something more out of the relationship in a way that won't make him freeze or run away?

I know that there's a possibility of him not being attracted to me as well, I have given him many chances to be honest with me and I have reinforced a number of times that I won't be angry with him if he doesn't feel the same was as me, but I would still like to know where we stand as friends. I think it would be easier for him to just stop talking to me since he has moved to another city for four months for an exchange program and coming back in the spring, yet he still keeps in touch with me.

And even if we don't develop a romantic relationship, there are still some social norms that seem natural to almost everyone I know that escapes him and I wonder what I could do to accomodate him and what I should expect from him if in fact he is autistic.

Anyone got any advice?

786,Some questions from a dad who still doesn't understand his daughter's autism diagnosis.,"My 3 year old, Izzy, was diagnosed with autism a year and a half ago, at the age of 2. At the time, she was speech delayed, had really just learned to walk confidently, would make no eye contact, was emotionally flat, almost never smiled or laughed (but would cry and get angry), and even though we were convinced that her severe jaundice at birth had done something to her just short of kernicterus, we went along with the autism ""thing"" to get therapy for her. Speech therapy. Behavioral therapy. Motor therapy. All that stuff.

She's now in preschool through our town's special education program.

Let me try to explain what's happened over the past year, and why I'm confused about whether Izzy really is autistic, or something else is going on:

A year ago, Izzy was 6 months into her speech, behavioral, and motor therapy. A very slight aversion to textures had mostly vanished, or at least seems to have vanished. Otherwise, she was much the same as when we started. She had a few words now to request things like juice or milk or food, and that was about all. 

Then one day, maybe 6 months and one week into her therapy, Izzy looked at me and said, ""Daddy, I love you. I'm hungry, can I have a snack?""

I bawled. I'm crying writing this. That was the first time Izzy expressed love verbally (we'd gotten some half hearted hugs in the past, in response to requests most often).

over the next 6-8 months, Izzy came alive. She went from being a little wooden puppet to a real girl, if you'll pardon the metaphor, it really is the only way I can think of to relate her transformation.

Izzy started talking in ever more complex sentences, which is I guess what happens with any toddler, but after so much silence and apparent indifference, it really seemed revelatory in her case. But talking wasn't the only thing. She started smiling easily. Laughing. Hugging. She started showing spontaneous imaginative play with her toys. A few months ago, Christmas 2012 was the first thing that Izzy had ever expressed excitement for in her life (previously the gift of one of her favorite things elicited a rather terse, ""Oh, I like that. Thank you."") Recently, she was bouncing in her seat, smiling and laughing, as we drove to the aquarium to ""see the sea lions and penguins.""

It's like the lights are coming back on inside her head, one at a time.

Is this typical for ASD kids? My impression is that progress like this is very hard won for most kids with autism. That sudden, dramatic breakthroughs like this aren't common or even in line with the expected progress of the disorder(s).

Has anyone else here had an experience like this?

About the only ""relic"" left of Izzy's ASD presentation is her moderate-and-sometimes-extreme aversion to eye contact. If not for that, I don't think she'd be diagnosed today. She becomes adamant about routine when exhausted (she gave me a ten minute lecture this morning for turning on the bathroom light to wash up, instead of waking her up to do it), but I think a lot of young kids are like that..?

It's not so much that I'm in denial as that I either have a hole in my knowledge of the way autism works, or Izzy's case doesn't fit.

793,"As an adult, how likely am I to be laughed out of my dr.'s office for asking to be assessed for ASD?","Hey r/Autism,

This is something I have struggled with for a few years.  Since I first started learning about Autism/HFA/Asperger's and the like, I've felt like many things I have gone through made more sense.

I've been clinically depressed for most of my life and I also have generalized anxiety disorder -- all of this according to a psychiatric assessment done 8 years ago, when I was 15.  I am quite intelligent (I'm not trying to toot my own horn, please forgive me) and did really well in school initially, but my performance declined in high school and into college -- it isn't that I cannot learn or do not know the subject matter, it's just that none of it interests me.  I don't feel it is worth my time (good or bad -- it's a constant struggle with myself).

I have always had *immense* difficulty maintaining eye contact, and I still struggle with allowing people to touch me.  However, I can read people/their motivations and read between the lines very well.  I have a hard time with social boundaries and have to constantly remind myself not to say what I think AS I think it.  The inability to always do that has bit me in the ass before.

I have a freakish memory for numbers...I still remember the phone number for that language-learning software, Muzzy -- commercials for which I haven't seen since the mid-'90s (800-424-0700, if you were considering making a purchase...).

I'm always considered the ""weird"" one in any group of friends I've had.  I make jokes that are sometimes kind of ""out there"", I tend to isolate myself at inappropriate times, I dwell obsessively on details, and I have a very, very hard time letting things go/moving on.

Due to my difficulties in college classes, I was tested for ADD/ADHD a couple of years ago but I tested negative for both.  Based on the research I've done, I feel it could be beneficial for me to at least be assessed to see if I am ""on the spectrum"", as it were...even if only to put to rest this idea that I could have HFA.  The problem is, I'm afraid that I'll be laughed out of my GP's office for suggesting such a test.  Also, since I have been assessed for attention deficit disorders in the past, I'm concerned that this will all just look like a ploy for ""the spotlight"" or whatever -- which is the last thing I want.

I'm sure this community deals with this kind of post every day, so for that I'm sorry.  I'm just feeling more and more lost with this nagging feeling that depression isn't the reason for all of the social oddities I've noticed about myself.

Any advice anyone can offer is greatly appreciated.

803,Developmental pediatrician vs. Neuropsychiatrist,"Hi,

I'm looking for advice about finding the right professional to manage my son's development.

My son is 5 1/2 and has been diagnosed as PDD-NOS with sensory integration dysfunction.  We live in urban Utah, and after an early diagnosis, went through most of the state's early intervention programs -- OTs, STs, PTs, kindermusic, directed play groups, special ed preschool.  He's spent the past two school years in a school specifically for autistic kids.  Through that, he's had ABA geared towards helping him ""attend"" in a classroom, in addition to learning some of what you'd learn in a typical kindergarten.  He's also been seeing a speech therapist in a group ""social skills"" session once per week.  He really digs that.

He does pretty well now, although he's still delayed in many areas.  He seems to really enjoy social contact and seeks it out.  He knows a lot more than he can communicate.  He will speak in complete sentences occasionally, but tends to lose his speech when he's upset.  He makes pretty good eye contact, particularly when asked.

He's very impulsive, fidgets constantly, and chews his sleeve or shirt most of the time.  He's mostly potty-trained, is pretty obstinate about getting his way, and is generally pretty happy.

His teacher told us at our last meeting that she thinks he'd make more progress in a typical kindergarten.  We're trying to get him into one for next year, and will find him a shadow for at least the start.

With him leaving his current school, I *really* want to find someone who can give us good advice as he develops.  His current pediatrician is great, but doesn't know diddly about autism.

What kind of specialist should we look for?  A neuropsychiatrist?  A pediatrician specializing in development and behavior?  Other?

We can't even be positive his diagnosis is accurate.  He may have severe ADHD along with SID and that just looks like PDD-NOS.  We've never tried medications for behavior, but I'd like to have that option available as he gets into the typical school.

Any other advice for us?

Thanks very, very much.

Some of the things he does makes no sense and I don't know if they are autistic behaviors.

For one he cries all day, cries when he wakes up, cries when he has to take a nap. When nap time comes he will reach for me and when I grab him he will run away crying. Same with food. He's not eating much anymore and spits EVERYTHING out. If the piece is too small he will scream and cry after spitting it out. He's even doing this with favorite foods which used to not be a problem. I am concerned about him losing weight now. We are worried it may be sensory issues as well.

He's literally a nightmare all day and it's driving me and my husband crazy and we have no idea what to do. Does this sounds like an autistic behavioral thing? (he's also not talking, repeating or imitating.) He is smart though because he knows all his shapes and zoo animals due to us using an ipad with him)

Another problem I am having is Early Intervention in California.
They are horrible. My sons insurance denied him for speech therapy and now Early Intervention does not want to provide it because they don't think he needs it BUT my son had an evaluation and the SLP said he was severely delayed and needed speech therapy.

808,We were told to leave a cafe because we had a service dog with us; we called the police but the cafe employee lied,"My daughter, a 23-year-old woman with multiple disabilities (legal blindness, seizures, autism), uses a service dog from PGI (Paws Giving Independence). I was with Sarah and her dog, Jordan, in Chicago, when we decided to go into an independently-owned coffee shop named Cafe Descartes at 327 N. Michigan Avenue in Chicago. As soon as we entered the shop, the only employee there began shouting at us, asking us to leave and saying ""No pets! No pets!"" We attempted to explain our ADA protections and to show him the paperwork &amp; I.D. badge that we carry in Jordan's zippered vest, but the employee would not touch or look at the materials, nor would he listen to our explanations.

The employee placed a call to the store owner, who was in Rockford, Illinois at the time. After he got off the phone with the store owner, he told us that we could ""stay one-half hour only."" Again, I explained to him that we had the same rights as any other customer, and could stay as long as we chose to stay. I called the police non-emergency phone number and requested that they send out an officer for mediation.

After speaking to the employee, the officer showed us a bottle of ""Espresso Machine Cleaner,"" and explained that the employee told her that the chemicals were unsafe for pets. He said that the espresso machine was leaking. However, the floor was bone-dry when we entered the store and there wasn't a chemical smell that we could detect. Additionally, there were children present in the store. None of the children had been yelled at or asked to leave. I took a picture of the espresso machine cleaner bottle with my cell phone.

This morning, I realized that a police report had not been generated. I called to speak to the officer, Officer Rodriguez in the 1st District, to request a written report. She refused to write a report, saying that she ""did not know the brand name of the cleaner."" I am working with the Chicago Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities in order to get a written report.

By the way, the brand name of the espresso cleaner that purportedly excluded us from the cafe was ""Cora Clean.""

811,Autism and taxes - what is deductible?,"My son is 5 and diagnosed with autism. Thankfully we have health insurance and our state passed legislation that requires all health insurance companies to pay for autism related therapy. We still have to pay out of pocket and file for reimbursement (minus $20 co-pay per session) every 2 weeks. Adding up all of those co-pays and other expenses still puts us under the 7.5% medical deduction limit. 

This past year, we made the decision to move our son to full-day preschool care, even though my wife hadn't found a job yet. His shortcomings are mostly in language and social interaction, so he really needed to be a school-type surrounding for his development to move forward. Several months later, my wife is still unemployed, and my son is still in pre-school (and making good progress toward better social skills). 

According to the IRS, we are ineligible for the Child Care Tax Credit because my wife isn't working. I understand the reasoning that if one parent isn't working, why is the child NOT with them instead of paying for child-care. But for us, this was a decision based on my son's development, not on the employment status of my wife.

It all started because we did some google searches and found that a lot of things fit. (2 years and 4 months and can't really speak, is not interested in other kids).

821,Any suggestions on dealing with the insurance company?,"I got a notice in the mail today that I need to pay $800+ for speech therapy for my son for the month of October because my insurance is refusing the claim. I called my insurance and they informed me that my son's occupational therapy was approved, but his speech therapy did not meet their demands of a necessity. I asked how that was possible because my sons language skills are mostly echolalic and not spontaneous. 

Apparently because my son sees the speech therapist and the occupational therapist on the same day at the same location, the facility only sent over one approval form for both. Because the Occupational therapy was listed first, that is the one that the insurance used the paperwork for, instead of for both, as it was intended. They say that each therapist needs a seperate claim. This was for his October therapy, he has had therapy every week since then. They have never once notified me. 

I got the paperwork straightened out, and he is now covered for speech therapy ""pending doctor approval"". They will back date it to all claims that have not been processed so far. Meaning December. November and October were already processed through their system and rejected so they are not covered. We've had the same insurance since 2011, with no breaks in coverage, can they do this? To my way of thinking, I went through the appropriate channels and got all the referrals in place before he started speech therapy, so this is not my error. The clinic sent the forms needed, albeit they sent a combined form instead of individual forms like the insurance wanted, so it would seem it is not their fault either. The insurance company had all the right paperwork, just not on individual forms and they even took info from that form to approve the occupational therapy. It looks to me like their error. Maybe I am wrong on that.

If I can't get them to pay for the speech therapy I am going to ow the clinic $1600 which I simply don't have right now. I don't know what their policy is, but I assume it is possible for them to cancel his speech therapy due to non-payment of October and November. That would be really bad.

824,"Cutting 7yo hair. Mid-functioning, low verbal. He's too strong to do it anymore... help!","I have a 7yo boy who is mid-functioning, low verbal. He is mentally pretty smart/clever, but is totally ""self contained"" and has the speech patterns of maybe a 2.5 year old? I don't know how to describe it, he sort of ""sounds"" like Rainman from the movies (he's not a savant though). So trying to ""communicate"" and reason with him is very hard. He is capable of understanding, but getting through his bubble is aways difficult. He mostly repeats back what we say to him, but usually pared down to 3-4 words. 

So he comes out of the bathroom and has used scissors to cut a lot of his hair, all chopped up. It's good he's not afraid of haircuts anymore. We cut his hair maybe every 3 months with scissors, and usually have him watch his iPad while we do and it's been okay. So we try to finish it with scissors, and it's just not going to happen. So I get out the clippers, which he is terrified of, but I don't know how else to do it. We haven't buzzed his hair in maybe 1.5 years since he does okay with the scissors.

So we bribe him with a trip to the toy store to buy anything he wants, and he lets us start on the top. We can do the top of his head, but to do the sides/back, he just freaks out. At this point, the top of his head is shaved and the sides/back are 2 inches long... 

Well, I am with my wife trying to get it finished. We're all 3 struggling, and I sort of have to hold him down to finish it. He's really upset and struggling, and I find out since the last time we did this, he's a lot stronger. Too strong to do this. I had to hold him a lot harder than I am comfortable with, but in the moment we just needed the haircut done. I won't be restraining him again, it was a bad choice and made me very sad.

After we finished, he was really upset so I had him sit with me and we stimmed with our hands a bit, I joined him in it to help him feel better, and in a few minutes he was okay and we went and got a big Lego set.

So, what do we do now? I realize that we could let him grow out his hair down to his butt, but it seems like he's okay enough with scissors to have us do that. This time, we couldn't fix it with scissors because he had literally cut it against his scalp as short as scissors could.

So how do any of you do it? Do we have to focus on a lot of conditioning and desensitization? Should we do a fake haircut like once a week? Any help would be appreciated, I am not educated in what to do with ""live at home for the rest of his life"" Autism, especially when he's bigger and stronger than me.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/16hz5a/cutting_7yo_hair_midfunctioning_low_verbal_hes/,607

Recently while reading [A Modest Proposal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal), a satiric essay,  a student who is on the spectrum had difficulty recognizing and interpreting the satiric text.

I'm hoping that you could point me toward some research on helping individuals on the spectrum recognizing and understand satire, or even if you have any experience teaching or interpreting satire with or as a students on the autistic spectrum. 

Secondly,Satiric texts are often featured on state exams, does any one know any strategies to help students recognize a satiric passage when they encounter them with out support?

834,Assistive Tap makes tapping and scrolling easier on sensitive iPad screens (Posco AAC app),"Hi everyone! I hope you all had a nice holiday and you're enjoying the New Year.

Many of you probably remember me from my posts about my app, Posco AAC. You guys have given me some great feedback on it and I have some amazing features planned for the near future! But for right now, I'd like to tell you about Posco's newest feature, Assistive Tap.

Assistive Tap makes the navigation of Posco easy for users who are not used to the sensitivity of touch screens. During my testing with people at my high school's special ed department, as well as with families in the area who use apps like this with their children, I found that some users had difficulty gently tapping on the screen. Because the user would push hard on the screen, as if it was a physical button, the iPad would interpret it as a scroll, rather than a tap. This was frustrating for the user, the parents and special ed teachers, as well as me.

I finally figured out a solution to this problem. Posco AAC with Assistive Tap enabled allows users to push hard on the screen without it being mistaken as a scroll. I have spent a lot of time perfecting this feature, and as of right now, I'm the first app to implement this kind of functionality.

For existing users of Posco AAC, how is this new feature working for you? And for existing users who think that this kind of feature would help them / someone they know, I encourage you to give Posco AAC a shot! I'll be making a video soon to demo Assistive Tap so stay tuned for that as well.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/164ngq/assistive_tap_makes_tapping_and_scrolling_easier/,614

839,Do you ever feel like autism is under represented?,"That may not be the right term exactly, I have just been reading stories of various families struggling with various diseases and genetic disorders and I got to thinking, autism seems to be passed over in terms of funding, understanding and help available. Maybe it's just me, maybe it's just because I live in an area where there isn't even a pediatric neurologist in the state and only 1 developmental pediatrician. But it seems to me that because autism isn't life threatening, it gets passed by. 1 in 88 children has autism according to autismspeaks.org and that number is growing, so why the lack of attention? 

Autism isn't without it's dangers, my son has epilepsy which I am told goes hand in hand with autism. Last year I ended up having to do CPR on him because a massive seizure stopped his heart. He was 4 at the time. He was molested this past school year and we can't do anything about it. The police say he is an unreliable witness because his verbal skills aren't great. His medications and therapies cost thousands, but you can't get disability for high functioning autism to help provide these for him. My husband took a job working on location in the oilfield just to help us pay for what he needs and provide good insurance. We only get to see him 6 days a month. Why is there not more awareness and help available?

Before I had my son, I had only heard of one instance of a child with autism, my best friend's little brother. He is moderately autistic, with the right therapies early on he might have been high functioning, but as an adult he's moderate. I thought he was mentally handicapped. That is what autism was to me. Another friend had a son 8 months after I had my son. Early on you could tell something was wrong. He didn't develop like other children and was happy sitting alone. He was diagnosed before a year as having autism. My son didn't talk much or well, and he seemed a little different than other kids, but surely he couldn't have autism, he ran and played with other kids. I didn't know the difference between playing next to and playing with at that time. At 2 I asked his neurologist if my son might have autism. He called my sons name and when my son turned to look at him, he said, ""See, he's not autistic. He responds to his name and looks at you."" It was another year before I dared bring up my worries again. 

I have read every one of Jenny McCarthy's books and most of it wasn't appropriate for my son. I couldn't get any doctor to run a blood test on him for heavy metal except for lead. No ABA therapies anywhere. The gluten and casein free diet just made him miserable. I've read everything else I can lay my hands on, the only thing that helped was ""Look Me In The Eye"" By John Elder Robison. At least that gave me some peace, if not answer. 

I worry constantly about what will happen after I am gone. Will one of his sister's take him in? Will their husbands accept him and be kind? Will he be able to manage on his own? How is he going to afford to live? Will he be able to work? He is so lost in his own world most of the time, will he remember to take his medications? 

I'm sorry this turned into a rant. My original intention was just to ask if my perceptions of how autism is treated and handled was correct. It went way beyond that and I am sorry.

844,Anyone that has experience using AAC apps: I need your help.,"Hi /r/autism,

This is my (long) story (if you want to skip just to my question, please scroll down to the tl;dr):

When I was 14, I started working closely with a student at my school who had many severe disabilities. Her name was Celine. She was barely able to speak, it was difficult for her to be accurate in her movements, and suffered many seizures. I was a part of a team of 5 that worked closely with her in developing social and communication skills. What was supposed to be just a volunteer opportunity for a year turned into a friendship, and I became close with her family and continued working with her through high school as well.

At the time, Celine was using a 'tablet' called Vantage. It was heavy, thick, the UI was bad, the screen was awful, but it was before the iPad was introduced, so it was the only option on the market. Turns out, the family paid $15,000 for this device. I couldn't believe it, and on their website, their tablets are still incredibly expensive [(roughly $7000 each)](https://store.prentrom.com/index.php/cPath/11). Fortunately, her family was very well off so they were able to afford this kind of device.

Then the iPad came out, and it was supposed to revolutionize the market for AAC devices. Today, there are many apps on the app store that are functional. The most popular being Proloquo2go. This year, I visited Celine and her family when I came home for the holidays (I attend university outside of my province). I spoke with her mother about what device Celine was using, and what apps she used. She was using an iPad with Proloque2go. However, her mother explained that she was not satisfied with the app. She tried many others as well, some of which were suggested by Celine's speech pathologist, but none of them were up to the standard she expected them to be.

I tried these apps on her iPad, and the biggest problem, aside from the poor aesthetic and design of the app itself, was the learning curve. I've been using an iPad ever since the 1st gen came out, and I still found it difficult to navigate around and learn the features. If a techy university student finds it difficult, I can't imagine how difficult it would be for a parent, or the child.

The worst part of this is the price. Not many families can afford to buy an iPad. However, the ones that make the investment are faced with an incredibly high price tag. Proloquo2go is $180, almost half the price of an iPad 2. Other apps that are cheaper are even less functional, and some apps even exceed $200. 

Now, I'm a university student, and I'm studying computer science. I'm also a graphic designer, and I like to think I know what good design is, what good UI is. I want to create the absolute best AAC app. I want the kind of clean, but functional design that [Clear](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/) has. It needs to have an easy learning curve, something that is so intuitive that it comes naturally. Lastly, it needs to be much much more affordable. Perhaps even free. It isn't fair that these big companies are taking advantage of a niche market with such high prices.

Over the next few months, I hope to bring together a team of designers and developers and start working on this project. There is no projected dates as of now, but I hope that a clear timeline of goals and milestones will be made in the next month or two.

**Now, here is my question:**

Do you have any experience with using AAC apps? Have you tried them yourself, or has your friend/family had experience with them? What was great about them? What was missing? How was the learning curve? If you could also specify the app, that would be phenomenal.

Thank you in advance for your help. This project is personally important to me; as it is for Celine. I hope you can help me make an unparalleled AAC app. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/15lej5/anyone_that_has_experience_using_aac_apps_i_need/,621

851,Anyone with experience regarding seizures/epilepsy in autistic children???,"My sister is 17yo and has low functioning autism. She gets along fairly fine though and is super happy and loves to laugh. The only health trouble of significant concern is that she experiences seizures once in a while (maybe once every few weeks). These usually start with her eyes drifting to one side and her becoming very quiet. They usually are drawn out for ~30 minutes (in and out of this seizure daze). We give her some medicine rectally typically, but it doesn't always put her to sleep. She also usually experiences nausea, and since she doesn't know how to throw up or spit saliva, it's very uncomfortable for her and us. 

I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this or could offer any advice in general? We have a neurologist but it's not like we're able to call him at any time of the day and get immediate medical attention. We always consider going to the ER (and we have before), but typically they aren't able to offer much help besides giving her an IV. We're usually stuck their and need to convince them to let us out the day after and we're left with a $1000+ bill for a single night.

852,Advice on tutoring someone who is autistic,"I figured this would be the best place to ask this question so any tips would be really helpful.

I'm most likely going to become an English tutor at my community college next semester, but I also might try helping out a family with an autistic son. He's about ten years older than me, and he is probably the nicest person I've ever met. His face totally lit up when I told him that I might become his tutor. 

He is incredibly self-motivated and enthusiastic. He actually goes to school (same college as me) just to feel ""normal"" which is truly amazing. Anyway, what do I need to know before I commit to becoming his tutor for a couple hours a week? I know that patience is key. What else? I think this would be a great opportunity for both of us, as I am an aspiring psychologist (psych major).

I really appreciate any advice that I can find on here, so thanks in advance.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/15d47r/advice_on_tutoring_someone_who_is_autistic/,628

What future awaits?","My girlfriend, 22, has a half brother who is 13 years younger than her, and is autistic. Their mother is pretty much a hermit, and they live in the middle of nowhere. He goes to school, but outside of that, doesn't have much interaction with other people or other stimuli besides television and his iPad.

She recently confided in me her concerns for when her mother is no longer with us, and his responsibility will fall to her and (possibly) me. I've had these same concerns upon realizing I could have a long future with this woman, which includes her family.  

I imagine this is far in the future, but I was wondering where I could find some resources about caring for autistic adults, and what life is like for that autistic individual and their caretakers? What sort of financial burdens are there? Medical?

854,Advice for people with autism,"as a person with autism i must give this advice especially with the heat the news groups on how violent people with autism are the cause of mass murders. as we know we are unlikely to commit a mass voilent act.
this post will hopefully help people with autism, if you are anything like me (an outcast) i found it hard to socialise and make friends especially im my younger years. i went to help clinics to try to help me deal with my autism, and depression from being such an outcast and bullied from my peers. over time i gradually learnt to deal with things but at a cost, i suppressed so much of my depression anger and other feelings to try to fit in with everyone i ended up being schizophrenic and still am to this day. this limits me more that ever before with social groups as people cant understand why i act differently on different days. 

so my message to people with autism is dont suppress your self to fit in, find people willing to accept you for who you are and make friends through other people. and dont take the road that i took of forcing myself to fit in with others.
there are always people willing to accept you for who you are :)",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/15byoo/advice_for_people_with_autism/,59

We went to a xmas musical show and the theatre sold glow in the dark sticks to the clientele - totally fine with that , added a bit of color to the event.  The couple beside us left during the interval and in the last 10 minutes of the show, a mother and child decided to take these seats.

The mother had a glow stick sitting on her lap and I asked politely if she could put it on the ground.

I get a torrent of abuse telling me that the child is autistic and that she hopes I never had children. 

My logic is she was an asshat using the kid as an excuse....

My sister, at the moment is suffering from a lot of anxiety from school. She is 12, and there is this girl who is taking away her best friend (who is also autistic) and she is being called names by some other kids. She always shows her stress and anxiety by harming herself (not to the extreme though). She picks her fingers constantly - even when she isn't at school. It has now resulted into her picking holes around her knuckles and picking her fingers until they bleed constantly. 

The thing is, the school won't help. At all. They did prevent the name calling for a little while, but unfortunately it is starting up again. The SENCO (basically a special needs co-ordinator for UK schools... I think) is a useless pile of poo. I am currently being diagnosed for ADD with possible Aspergers and she's been no help whatsoever (she doesn't even acknowledge the chance that I might have Aspergers, only ADD). My mother, bless her soul, is constantly fighting for my sister and I at the school. But they won't help.

But basically I just want help on how to prevent her from picking her fingers. Her fingers are now swollen and they're constantly covered in plasters.

Sam's seizure came to an end after about a minute and I snuggled him into me. We cuddled for a few minutes while he went through a short post dictal phase. Then he looked at me and reached out and patted my face. ""Sams loves you."" He said. 

My son is on the autism spectrum and while he is verbal, he doesn't make a ton of spontaneous speech. He'll reply to you or repeat something he has heard, but in general doesn't make independent speech. I've heard him say I love you to me before. I say ""I love you.""

859,Last-minute Christmas gift ideas for a non-verbal autistic teenager?,"Hi all,

I have a younger brother (18) who is what you would call, I think, ""severely autistic."" He is very alert and bright, likes to hang out with the family and laughs at jokes, but he doesn't speak at all. He also can't read for the most part. He doesn't really draw, paint, or play music (though he does occasionally bang on the piano, and he has a toy keyboard that he just uses to play the preset songs). I tried to get him interested in video games once, but I think the controls confused him.

I'm having a really hard time finding him a Christmas gift. It's difficult because he's too mature for most children's toys, but he can't follow the instructions for big kids toys, and since he can't read, that rules out most adult gifts. He's also outgrown all the movies he used to watch, but I don't know if he would sit still for a more mature movie.

It's also frustrating because, while scouring the internet for ideas, I've found suggestions for autistic children and high-functioning autistic teens, but not non-verbal young adults.

So far what I've though of getting a Hoberman Sphere, which is very difficult to find, it turns out, and a stress relief ball (or something he can fidget with), which is also surprisingly hard to find. If nothing else, I'll get him legos or a puzzle. Barnes &amp; Noble had some cool stuff.

He's pretty physically active, but since he'll be cooped up at my parents' house for a couple weeks during the winter break, I wanted to get him something he can enjoy indoors.

The other dilemma is, of course, it's a little late to order anything online. I'm in a big city so I have access to a lot of different stores, but it's hard to find exactly what I want.

Does anyone have any suggestions? This is the first year I've been able to  buy the whole family presents and I don't want him to feel left out. I'd love some advice, since I don't know anyone else who has an autistic sibling or child, and I've never had to deal with this particular issue before.

860,"English teacher in Japan, needing some advice for teaching an autistic student! ","Hello everyone! I am in need of your advice. 

I work at an English school in Japan. Keep in mind that the type of school I'm at only required a degree to be hired- my degree is in art, not teaching. But I am finding that I do love this job and I do my best for my students. 

Now, I have this autistic child, let's call him Yuu. I do my best to teach him, but my company's offered nothing more than a shrug and a 'lol dunno' when I ask for advice on how to teach Yuu. I barely had time before my first lesson with him to Google 'how to teach autistic kids'! I've been doing my best, but I'd love to get some better advice on how to teach Yuu better. 

Here are some constants I can't change- his lessons are at random. There is no schedule to when he comes in- not even the time of day is similar. It's basically when his parents want to bring him. He is not guaranteed to have the same teacher. Because he has different teachers that will try different things for him, there is no set schedule in the class. Even if I wrote a lesson plan, there is no guarantee the others will follow it. 

We use flash cards to help build up to a sentence, but the most I can seem to get from him is one word answers. He focuses a lot on single words, both in English and in Japanese. He has a great memory- I can point to nearly any picture in the book and he can tell me what it is- but sentences are usually a no-go. His writing is also excellent. He has to change colors when drawing different pictures or he gets upset. He seems to our mascot character and (according to a note from another teacher), he enjoys songs.

Any advice at all is great appreciated. I know his parents pay a crap ton of money for these lessons and I want Yuu to enjoy class and hopefully learn something helpful! What I'd really love to do is to write a proper guide or at least an info packet so myself and the other teachers can help Yuu to the best of our abilities. Thank you so much for reading!

Now, in 2012, these children have grown up and aged out of a services system primarily geared towards early intervention and childhood therapies. There is little information available about the changing needs of adults with ASD or which types of programs and services they may require to lead fulfilling lives.

If you are an adult on the spectrum or a parent or guardian of an adult on the spectrum, we invite you to [take our survey](http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/participate/adult-asd-survey) on services needs. The data collected from the survey will inform decision making with regard to the services and programs that should be created or expanded, and the ones that may no longer be of value to adults with ASD. 

You are eligible to participate if you live in the United States and are:
 
* An 18-35 year old adult with ASD who is independent (that is, you are not under anyone’s legal guardianship)

* The parent of an 18-35 year old independent adult with ASD (that is, your adult son or daughter with ASD is not under legal guardianship and maintains the right to make their own medical and legal decisions)

* The legally authorized representative of an 18-35 year old dependent adult with ASD (for example, you may have legal guardianship or medical power of attorney for the adult with ASD)

If you do not meet the eligibility requirements, please share this with someone who does. Your participation is critical. Inform those planning programs of the resources and services adults with ASD and their families need most!

868,Autism and the shooting in CT,"I sent this letter to every single person I could think of at our district, including the Superintendant and the School Board.


Dear (school) community:

There has been much discussion online and in the news about the connection between the Connecticut school shooting and the fact that the shooter may have been diagnosed with autism. As our families and our community discusses this issue and tries to find a reason for this heartbreaking tragedy, I feel that it is very important to remember the following: *There is no connection between planned, violent behavior and an autism spectrum diagnosis of any kind.*

Autism is not a mental illness; it is a developmental disability. Many autistic people may have emotional regulation problems, which are impulsive expressions of frustration and anger, that are immediate and disorganized. They may lash out with threatening statements or behaviors, but these behaviors are impulsive reactions, they are not deliberate or organized plans. Once the situation has been diffused, the behaviors will stop. What happened in Connecticut required methodical planning of a deliberate and tremendously violent act; this is not typical behavior of an autistic person.

Right now we are all struggling to find a reason why this kind of atrocity would happen, and we can speculate about the mental state of the shooter; about gun control laws; about the current state of our country’s mental health system, or about whatever else that might help us make some sense out of this. Please know, and please tell your children, that even if the shooter *was* autistic, autism is not the explanation for this tragedy.

If anybody has any questions about autism, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you very much for your time,

My son has a book from his previous school that he made with his teacher that contains a picture and recipe of something they cooked each week. My son likes to look at this book every once in a while but is by no means attached to it.

I picked him up after work from my mum's house last week and he had been writing in his recipe book. He had written a date on most pages. I noticed that the date on the spiderweb cake page was near Halloween and the date on the easter cake was near Easter. Then I checked and found that the dates were all on a school day one week apart. He remembers the date on which he cooked each item. This book is from 5 years ago. 5 frickin' years. 

I asked him about it and in his one word responses he seemed to think it was no big deal. He just remembers. He has some other impressive talents and I've always thought he was amazing regardless but this one has finally popped my brain balloon!

Any advice or knowledge would be wonderful.","Ok, first off I'll take some time to describe you my brother.  He's mildly autistic, but many of the severely autistic kids I know can't speak and use PECS (using pictures for words and to form sentences) to communicate.  He has a HS Diploma, but all his classes were modified; but it's still a real diploma.  He loves video games, especially the simple ones.  Frankly, if he had it his way, he would probably play them all day.  He also really likes comics, but not serious stuff.  He likes the Disney comics a ton and the Simpsons.  Socially, he's pretty closed off.  He really only spends considerable time with me, my parents, and a tutor.  Every weekend we see a movie, go bowling, minigolf, or something like that.  We play a decent amount of video games together because I like it and we really bond during that time (and I've never seen anyone so good with fucking Yoshi in super smash bros).  However, he still has temper problems sometimes, but they're rare now.  He self talks quite a bit, but he knows that this is weird and usually doesn't do it in public too much and what he does is usually under his breath.

I've talked to my dad about it, and when he can't do it any more, I'm going to manage a trust for my brother.  I don't want to sound like a dick, but my dad has been successful as a lawyer, and I don't see me needing to support my brother so long as I manage the trust decently.  This is really a great blessing as I'm free of a major financial responsibility.

That being said, I know I'll have the money, but I don't know what the plan really is.  Now that he's out of school, he goes to an animal shelter in Concord, but he has to be accompanied by his tutor because...well you know.  The other two days he goes to Creative Growth in Oakland.  We really do think that he likes making art, but he doesn't really communicate well.

Side note: if you want a pretty sweet Ghostbusters backpack and want to donate to a good cause, ring up Creative Growth.  One of the guys makes them, but they're a little pricey, but it's a good cause.

But this really just seems like temporary measures.  We live in the Bay Area, so I'd assume that we have access to most resources that would be available.  I'd like my brother to live as independently as possible.  However, I fear that if he were completely independent he would do nothing but game all day, which is a life that I don't see being healthy for him.  So maybe some kind of group home type setting that could give him some work and activities to do?

My parents are old (which is a major source of guilt for them) at 65 and 62 respectively.  Frankly, I can tell that they're starting to burn out.  Dealing with autism is a 24/7 job and my parents deserve the time alone.  Besides, my dad's retiring and I know that he wants to travel.  My parents have sacrificed a lot of my brother and they've earned some freedom.  Besides, they won't be able to take care of my brother forever mentally or physically.

Basically, I'd love to hear from some people who have siblings with autism (or other disorders) who are older or who have plans on what they're doing.  I'd really appreciate any help reddit has to offer.

Plug: check out the Dan Marino Foundation; they do a lot of good for families with autistic kids who can't afford the therapy that can really help.

877,I am kind of losing it... My 5-year old has stated that he was hit by school staff,"Well... Like the title states I have no idea what to do. I have a very verbal, very engaged 5-year old son with autism. He has been going to the same preschool for over 2 years. 

He has been SUPER fragile tonight and very weepy which is pretty unusual for him. He has been crying about ""something very bad""  happening. I tried to ask questions without leading him and eventually what he told me was that Pam, his OT hit him in the front of the head (although he stated she has hit him in the back of the head too,). 

I really don't know WTF to think /do. He has been fully sobbing when he talks about this but according to his primary teacher Pam is one of his favorite support people. 

Please throw advice and ideas my way.

**EDIT** - I've spoken to his advocate and she said her suspicion, based on the way he is reporting it (consistent facts, holding his forehead in the same spot every time when he talks about her hitting him, etc.), is that this very well might have happened. That is *not* to say that it wasn't something like her accidentally bumping him, or something similar. 

He has an appointment with his counselor on Monday and his advocate said she would be the person to help figure out the nuts and bolts of what actually occurred. 

I have kept him out of school for the last two days, and if his counselor feels like *something* happened I will likely not have him return until things are resolved. 

i guess I'll keep you all posted. Thanks for all the thoughts and advice. I guess right now I'd rather he's wrong, and still be keeping him safe than risk him being right and throwing him to the lions. 

**EDIT2** Little Man's counselor believes something happened, based on his consistency and reaction. What she can't say is whether it was intentional or not. I haven't sent him back to school yet.

Yesterday after the meeting I called the Directer of Special education for the SAU and explained to her what is going on. The are opening an 'investigation"" for whatever that's worth.

I think the really unfortunate truth is that it's going to be a 5-year old kid with autism's word against an educated and professional adult. Whether it happened or not, I'll probably never know. I can tell you for sure that if they are unable to provide another OT to work with him we'll be suspending OT services. I am also going to tell the school that I do not want him doing one-on-one work with anyone, unless it is in an area where there are cameras.

878,From the Mouths of Babes,"I've had many people ask me over the years what it is like to be Autistic. How does it feel when my senses are overwhelmed and I have a melt down. I've tried and tried to come up with the appropriate response, but I was an adult when I was diagnosed. When I was a child, I was told that I was making things up and acting bad on purpose. My parents saw me as willful and disobedient and never asked me how I was feeling or why I did what I did. As an adult, I just can't describe it now. It is like me asking a normal person what it feels like to be normal. 

I was talking with a friend a while back. She is NT but she has two autistic children. She once asked her more verbal child (who was under the age of 5 at the time) what it felt like when his senses went haywire.

His response: PAIN. Worse than a physical injury or a spanking. I had never thought about it that way. But it is true. That is what I feel. Intense and overwhelming pain. 

I hope that this helps you understand your loved ones. This may be what they feel like too. Be gentle with them. Let them stim when it is appropriate. Remember, we live our lives like exposed nerves chafing at every sound, every touch. It is especially true when I have to look someone in the eye. I now have the words.

879,How to intervene the singing behavior(vocal stereotypy)?,"Hello All,

First a little context. My daughter is 2 y and 7 months. She was diagnosed with PDD when she was 2 y and 3 months. She was non-vocal, non-communicative, non-pointing, spinning ,toe walking and auto-singing. We had started Early Intervention and in four months of therapy she has shown a lot of improvements.Now she is saying a few words, pointing at things and playing meaningfully.

But her singing behavior has not reduced. She is singing all the time. Mostly rhymes we had taught her earlier. When i say all the time, i mean she can sing to herself for hours if left alone.This was not a problem before, but now it is becoming a problem as she becomes completely unresponsive when singing. 
The therapists say, if we can reduce the singing , she will become more attentive. The therapists have suggested two things.  

1) To intervene her when she starts singing by tapping or saying ""shhhh"".

2) To play some classical music whenever she is singing to herself.

I am trying to figure out how this works so that i can efficiently manage this. I tried reading some articles on vocal stereotypy but they were beyond my comprehension. Any help is really appreciated. Thanks!

Title: Parenting Stress, Psychological Well-Being, Depression, and Anxiety in Parents of Children with and without Pervasive Developmental Disorders

This dissertation research study will examine the unique experiences encountered by parents of children with differing needs. I am seeking parents or primary caregivers of children that are:

1) Typically developing

2) Diagnosed with a genetic disorder (such as Down Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome, Turner Syndrome, etc.) or

3) Diagnosed with a pervasive developmental disorder (such as Autism, Asperger's Disorder, Rett's Disorder, etc.).

All parents are welcome to participate, however parents of children age 12 or younger are preferred. Should you choose to participate in this study, you will simply be required to fill out a one-time, anonymous survey based on your experiences as a parent.

881,Extreme moodiness,"I'm a 27 year old female with high functioning autism. I've been fairly moody off and on since puberty. I can go from just fine to pretty much wanting to kill something (not completely literally...at least I wouldn't ever act on it) in no time flat. 
I am very much a loner and need a certain amount of alone time to even really be able to function on a semi normal level. I've noticed the last couple days that this has become pretty extreme, my bf who lives with me came home last night and within a few minutes I found myself wishing he would just go to sleep or something and leave me alone. The more he tried to talk to me I just got pissier and pissier and wanted to hit him. I have always had this problem with anyone I've attempted to live with and sometimes its been so bad or lasted so long that its ruined many of my relationships.
I used to think this was just due to not getting to spend enough time alone but recently I've had plenty of alone time, so that isn't it.

882,Vaccine deniers and their use of autism,"Afternoon everyone. 

Kinda unsure of whether I should ask this but it's something that has been bugging me for a long time. I frequent anti-vaccine pages, to debate for vaccines, and am struck by how often the now debunked link between autism and vaccines is still brought up as proof that vaccines are bad for us. What is bugging me is that, even though this 'fact' is still brought up, it is rarely done so by someone who is actually affected by autism (from what I can see).

From posts I see here I think it's fair to assume very few here think there is a link. Is there some responsibility to tell vaccine deniers to stop using autism to further their agenda?

I watched that entire C-span thing with the panel talking about autism and it just pained me every time the scientists would say there wasn't  a link and 5 minutes later one of the panel members asked about vaccines.

883,"Quiet, not rude","I am an autistic adult. I am verbal but my sensory problems put me well into the autistic category. While I can, under certain circumstances appear ""normal"" I have a hard time maintaining that act when my sensory system is being challenged. 

I have a service dog. After learning all the weird things he needs to do for me on a daily basis, he is now being trained to accompany me out in public. Kind of backwards compared to most service dogs, but an Autism service dog is not like most service dogs. Yesterday, we were working on training him to get me out of a crowded building on a cue so that I will feel more confident in public. When my system gets overtaxed I will sometimes have sensory meltdowns or sensory storms where my brain stops being able to process incoming information. When that happens I stop being able to understand the world around me, I can no longer read, talk or understand how to navigate the isles in the grocery store.

Yesterday when I was out training my dog I happened to walk past a bell ringer outside a store, actually several times as we were working on having him get us outside on a cue. The guy was pretty outgoing and was giving out loud Merry Christamses to everyone that walked near him. On about the 5th or 6th pass I once again said ""Merry Christmas"" back to the guy and he basically gave me a ""there you go"" since I guess I finally said it loud enough that he could hear me. At first I was just a little irritated. First at myself for acting in a strange manner and then at him for treating me like a kid and giving me an ""atta boy"". I am, very obviously an adult, with wrinkles to prove it. 

I guess his response, which wasn't all that out of the ordinary, hit a bit of a nerve for me. In public situations, I've been accused multiple times of being aloof or downright rude since I make very little eye contact passing people (even friends and acquaintance) and have a hard time responding to simple hellos. I've pissed so many people off who seem to think it is their right to get outraged by what they assume is my rudeness. I've even had people come up to me and chew me out publicly. I thought the confrontations might ease up as I got older since people wouldn't see me as a kid anymore and think it was their right to ""teach me manners"". I guess the take home for me on this is that it will keep happening and that I'm going to keep offending people who don't know better. 

If you have read this far, the information I would like to offer to you is that there are people, some may have autism and some may have other issues, that find it hard when they're already overstimulated from a sensory perspective (from being out in public in a crowd with weird lighting or lots of noise etc) to simply navigate and put one foot in front of the other in stores, office hallways, etc. If they seem off or aren't friendly to you, don't take it personally. They might not even be in a bad mood or be having a bad day, they may just have a disability that makes it difficult to behave in the way you think is appropriate.

If you would like, you can share my story. I am one of the few in the autism community that is not qualified as being Aspergers who is verbally articulate. I know I am not the only one on the spectrum who has run into these types of situations.

884,Its time I tell someone that I am a miracle child.,"When I was a boy, I was diagnosed with autism. I was completely non- verbal, in consent pain, and had so many trips to hospitals/doctors. One thing I had was motivation. My parents saw such determination for me to communicate and recover. My sister also has autism, so with 2 unique children things were CRAZY. The only memory I have from my beginnings is this beautiful white light. It was whiter then any light I have ever seen. Then I told my parents that I had to go to the bathroom. They started to cry tears of joy. The doctors who diagnosed me jaws were dropped when I walked in and started to communicate with them...I moved to a new town and lived my childhood as a normal kid. I feel blessed but a little guilty that I was granted a normal life, but my sister is still has this disorder. Although I have a gluten deficiency, and ADD. I can speak out my ideas, and act socially acceptable. I also understand autism so much since I am exposed to it everyday. It was something that I overcame, something that makes me feel blessed everyday. Parents, hope exists, I am living proof.

886,Determining whether or not a child is autistic.  Can r/autism help me?,"My 3 year old son just had his well-child checkup.  For all intents and purposes (physically, anyway) the doctor said he's doing well.  He asked if I had any concerns and I brought up the fact that his verbal skills are about a year or so behind where I know they need to be.  He tends to do a lot of the baby babble, using his own little language that nobody but him understands.  A stranger would maybe understand 25% of what he says, and often even his dad doesn't understand him even when I know he's said something clearly (or as clear as he can right now).  When he speaks this way, it's with inflection and intent, with the same vocal patterns as normal speech.  It just rarely has individual distinguishable words to it.

He does have some standard words in his vocabulary, things like ""milk, nanas (bananas), orange, cookies, fish, cars, puppies, cereal, hots (which is his catch-all word for cooked food of any kind), want, toys, ball, bath, splash, words, letters, numbers, mommy, juice, froggies, birds, thanks.""  He knows all his letters, numbers up to 10, and colors.  Once in a while I'll hear him give a 3 or 4 word sentence, but for the most part he'll use single words to indicate his desires.  And if he knows he's not being understood, he will take my hand and pull it to what he wants.  He is also reluctant when it comes to new things, and will panic and try to push me out the door whenever we go someplace he doesn't recognize.  It will take 3 or 4 visits before he gets comfortable in new places.  Introducing him to new movies or shows is a fight, but if it's got something I know he likes (puppies are his favorite thing on earth), it's easier.  He really does best when he's got strong routines and will panic if they're messed with... like if his dad puts him to bed instead of me, he freaks a bit (unless I'm not home for some reason).  These things combined had his doctor concerned that he might be autistic.

On the flip side of things, he is playful, loves to get and give hugs, listens and follows direction (ok to the point where any 3 year old will),  likes to be silly (if he finds something funny, he'll say ""silly dat!""), does well playing with other kids his age but will shy away from adults he doesn't know, makes good eye contact, and eats well.  His daycare loves him and says he's been doing really well (I just went back to work about a week ago), and has adjusted more quickly than I expected him to.  These aspects of his development are what have me thinking he's not autistic, just behind.

I was hoping that /r/autism could help me, because I'm EXTREMELY reluctant to let him be diagnosed as autistic if he's not.  I don't want him pigeonholed if he's actually just to the side of normal with a few developmental delays.  I'm concerned that with the trends of teachers and doctors labeling kids with disorders they may not actually have (ADD comes to mind as an excuse to turn otherwise active and creative kids into quiet drones just to make things easier on the teachers), that he'll get diagnosed and drugged rather than getting the boost in the one or two spots he really needs.

Can you guys help me?  Maybe offer some suggestions on things I should look for that would be clear indicators either way?

But as soon as we stop giving it to him (after about a month or so) a week will go by and boom it's back to the same issues.

I feel this is only a temporary fix for something that could possibly be way worse then just the occasional constipation. We have tried the gluten/casein free diets etc, and the only they seemed to do was put us in the poor house. 

I also feel this will cause major problems when he gets older and his on going potty training, as if it's hurting him to go to the bathroom he will be reluctant to do so, even if he just has to go pee as he will associate it with the pain of #2. 

We ask our Dr. if maybe we need to see a gastroenterologist, be she seems to think they will only say the same thing ""Give him miralax"".

Some background information, my sister of 17 has been diagnosed with autism since she was around 2 or 3 years old. I think she's around the moderate level of autism. She uses verbal language every now and then, usually only for basic commands. I haven't noticed too many sensory problems, other than some mild auditory sensitivity. She's always been a joy to be around.

I've always known that at some point I'd be the one to take care of her. For the time being she lives with her father. She also has very supportive grandparents that would be willing to take care of her at any time. Over the past few years I've been trying to figure out the best way to help her live a self-fulfilling life. It’s always been a dream of mine for her to be able to communicate with others on a deeper level than the usual “I want __”, or answers to simple yes or no questions. That would be an ultimate goal. I understand that it may not be a possibility. In that case I just want her to be the best and happiest she can be. I don’t really know how to go about this. 
I’m also not completely sure if my family has done the best with handling her autism over the years. They have put a lot of effort, and I respect them for it. But I feel as if there are HUGE flaws in the way they handle certain things, such as her mannerisms, lack of communication, etc. I don’t know how to go about fixing this. I also don’t know how to figure out the best way to help her.  Is it best to try and find a specialist? If so, I don’t know if I’ve liked the doctor we’ve gone to before. They seem to only prescribe medicine that helps calm her down. This solution just seems to make her completely emotionless and blank. She just sits quietly unless she wants something. It’s disturbing, but the people surrounding me find this to be an improvement. I don’t know if I’m right or wrong about stuff like this. I’d love some kind of expert opinion, or something along those lines. 

Eventually my sister will live with me and whatever family I have in the future. I’d like to know the best thing to do for her. If anyone has any advice or wants more details please feel free to comment or pm me.

I've got 3 kids, my oldest Sam is on the spectrum (apparently he's not autistic but on the spectrum? I never fully understood that). He's 5, soon to be 6, and has epilepsy as well. Had his first seizure at 2.5 and was put in speech therapy about the same time. Wasn't diagnosed until 4 because his neurologist didn't believe in autism. Sam answers to his name so obviously he is not autistic is what I was told. The preschool finally convinced the behavioral specialists to do the ADOS test and low and behold, we have a diagnosis. Kind of. Now we're told he's somewhere between cerebal palsy and autism. Whichever, he's my kid and he's awesome. He homeschools because of a bad experience in Kindergarten this year and it's frustrating, but we've made some progress. Math comes easy it seems, reading not so much.

901,How to deal with Self-Injurious behaviour?,"I have a student who is 9 years old, that exhibits SIB very frequently. He is in the lower middle spectrum of autism and he is verbal. He also has mental retardation.  Usually, his outbursts occur when he is denied something that he wants or it is taken away. Also, in order to evade doing something he will self-harm. His mother told me recently that she can sometimes hear him hitting himself in his room when he is alone. She also mentions that sometimes when he's watching something on the television he will do it. (This, I think; in excitement.)What he mainly does is hit his fists against his cheeks. I would like some coping strategies for this. What should I do when I have to say ""no"" and he starts self-harming? When should I ignore it?

902,What is the consensus here on people-first language? ,"Hey everyone, I'm the mod at /r/downsyndrome.  There was recently a comment on an article I posted about a ""down syndrome boy (the way the article was written)"" and the poster commented about using people first language, something I've been doing for a few years now.  However, I recently found out there are serious criticisms to this, specifically the ""X with 'disability'"" makes it sound like the person can get rid of it, which they can't. 

I work with a teen who has Down syndrome (or I guess a Down syndrome teen) so I feel like I need to make a choice on whether or not to use people-first language going forward. 

What do y'all think?

**Edit: After a few days, here's the rough tally:**

People-first: 4

Indifferent: 2

Depends on an individual basis: 4

Specifically referring to someone as an autistic (child/person/boy/girl): 3

905,"When to say no, when to hang tough?","I'm feeling like I have no idea what the best choice is and am hoping for some perspective.

I have twin sons age 7.  Twin A is on the spectrum, Twin B has ADHD.  Both are in Cub Scouts.  Here's where it gets messy:

*Sometimes* Twin A attends scouting with no issue. Most of the time, though, he seems miserable.  He has meltdowns, he doesn't participate, he distracts his brother constantly and can disrupt the group if I'm not right there with him at all times.  I make sure I am, but that means I'm not really able to support his brother.  I often am alone at these because my husband works second shift.

Two weeks ago, Twin A said he didn't want to go anymore.  If I'm being totally honest, I was actually relieved.  I asked him why and he told me it ""made his brain hurt and it was hard.""  I said that was understandable and that he could quit.

This past week we were suiting up Twin B to go and Twin A was absolutely heart-broken he wasn't going. He cried and said he was only kidding, he really wanted to go.  He then proceeded to explain that, ""Cub Scouts don't quit! They keep trying Mom!""  Point taken.  I suited him up and off we went for an hour of misery and hysteria.

I really and truly do not know what the best option is.  Am I protecting him by keeping him home?  Am I taking the easy way out?  Am I denying him an opportunity or understanding his limits?  Its not like I can just keep him home and he'll forget about this, his brother LOVES it.

I'd love your help. Here's the pitch. 


"" An undergraduate researcher in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at the University of Vermont is conducting an online study to find out more about the nature of online social networking versus in-person social networking. Specifically, she wants to know if there is any link between feelings about acceptance, loneliness and relationships to social interactions and online social networking usage. 

We are seeking 18-30 year olds with High-Functioning Autism or Asperger’s syndrome OR persons of the same age group without a history of psychological, behavioral, or mental illness who fall into one of two sub groups, 

1. people who use Online Social Networks for more than 3 hours daily 
2. people who use Online Social Networks for 3 hours or less daily. 

If you qualify, and choose to participate, you will be contacted about scheduling a one-time only Webcam interview or in-person interview for approximately 20-30 minutes. You will be asked questions about your online usage and also personal questions about your feelings on friends, relationships, loneliness, and social difficulties. If you do not have access to a computer with a webcam the interview will be conducted at a location of your choosing. The interview will be audio-recorded. After the interview you will receive an email link to a short 15-20 online survey about your online habits and you will be asked to rate your feelings about the aforementioned interview topics. Your information will be kept confidential and you can choose to withdraw at any time. 

After completing the interview and online survey, you will have the option to be entered into a drawing for a $100 amazon gift card!

909,Almost 2 months in to ABA Therapy and it's every bit as amazing as I hoped it would be!,"I was reminded when I saw another post on here today that the last time I posted here, I was having an extremely hard time coping with the day-to-day care of my son, who is now 4 years old and has an official diagnosis of PDD-NOS.

I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/yxgt6/just_need_to_vent_feel_like_a_prisoner_in_my_own/) about 2 months ago, and my life has dramatically changed for the better, so I thought it would be good to do a positive follow up post!

As I mentioned in my post, I spent the last few years being a SAHM/Student working on another bachelors degree.  I graduated in June and spent a few months looking for a job, and it was during this time that I felt like I was slowly going nuts taking care of my son.

Well, in early September I finally got a job offer, and the job itself was pretty much about as amazing as I could have hoped to find, in every measure.  The most significant part was that it pays well, which meant we could finally start considering ABA therapy!

Without digressing too much, ABA in my state is not mandated to be required by state law, and most insurance companies deny it.  There are currently no known cases of a family being able to get our current provider to cover it.  So we basically planned on footing the bill up front, but navigating the appeals process to hopefully eventually get some money back and set a precedent for other families in the future.

We knew we'd need to save up for a few months before we could afford it (it's about $1,500 a month for 10 hours/week).  But that was when we thought we'd also have to be paying about 2K a month for a nanny too.  And that was the wild card that changed everything.

As it so happens, a good friend of ours found herself in a bit of a bind and wanted to move back home to our town.  She knew I had gotten a job offer and would be searching for a nanny, so she volunteered herself in exchange for free room and board and a modest stipend.

Not only is she a dear friend that I trust, she's lived with us before so I felt completely comfortable sharing our house with her.

The arrangement immediately freed up our finances, and we started ABA on October 1st, which was a mere week after I started my new job!

Transitioning back to working full time and also not being a SAHM any more has been great for me, and a mixed bag for my son.  He definitely seems to appreciate me more (he's nicer to me...ha ha), but he's gotten clingier too.

But ABA...oh my, it has already made such a huge difference, and we're not even halfway through!  He's making and holding eye contact.  He's using speech appropriately and spontaneously.  He is finally starting to ""play pretend"" on his own and seems to enjoy it!  He is using his words to communicate his feelings or what he wants instead of just screaming or getting physical.  He is showing interest in things like books and baby dolls and new foods!  He's even learning how to play a board game with his therapists.  

I always had a feeling he would respond well to ABA, mostly because he's a pretty secure kid despite his communication struggles and social issues.  

I keep looking back at where he was a year ago, 6 months ago, and even 2 months ago and am finding myself at this state where I can finally start to see some real glimmers of hope.  And it feels *so. good.*

910,Does my son sound like he may have an ASD?,"Hello everyone, 


I have a 2 yr old son who is currently not verbal, does not imitate or repeat and only screams or grunts when he wants something.
His form of communication is handing us things. 


He is an only child and there are absolutely no children around.
Now, he has a pediatrician who is sending us to a neurologist to check tor autism and I am terrified that he could be diagnosed with ASD. 
He started with Early Intervention in January of this year and has not made any progress AT ALL. In fact he has taken a step back, he used to play peek a boo and won't do it, he used to repeat EI EI OO and won't repeat it any more and now he will not even sit with his early intervention teacher. He screams and runs away from her and she basically has to leave. 

All my son likes to do is watch Yo Gabba Gabba all day and all night, When he is not watching it he will cry for it by handing me the remote or grabbing my phone which he likes to watch it on, he has had this habit since he was hospitalized in the beginning of the year for MRSA infection and it has stuck. 
On top of all of this he is so needy, he cries for everything at the drop of a hat to get his way. Everything is a fight, he won't eat, won't sleep at times, doesn't like to try new foods, won't drink out of a sippy cup, he's still on bottles and he likes to get his bottles and push the nipples in all day. He cries when I take them away.
He's starting to regress in my opinion, less eye contact and less verbalization. He currently does not understand anything but his name and ""Stop""

Early Intervention has been of no use for us, they will not help us with speech therapy or do an evaluation for autism. I have no luck with them so his pedi is helping me and I am going to attempt to get help out of pocket. 

I need some advice, insight, what does it sound like to you?

I hear a lot of people say that when the Doctors diagnosed them or their kid they've been told ,""There's not much hope,' or things like ,' Don't expect too much."" Why the hell do they say that???!! Our kids are amazing and they overcome challenges all the time. It's true some of them may always need help or to be at home but that doesn't take away from their value. A lot of children with Autism seem to be doing amazing things I know that ours are and they are little. Why would a Doctor say something like this to a parent?? I understand preparing for the worst but to basically flat out say there's no hope?? I just can't wrap my mind around that. I know I'm young and inexperienced in this field I guess it just really gets to me because I love our kids they are so amazing and special to me. I can't imagine telling them that or feeling that way about them.

To be quite honest, I'm really tired of people trying to make my mental illness not a thing, which means I lose my SSI money, which means I lose my place to live, which means I become homeless. And nobody wants to help the homeless.

So I mean, unless Jenny McCarthy and all her cronies want to help me monetarily after I'm ""cured"" of my autism, then just leave me and all my ASD brethren and cistern alone.

My younger sister is 26 and lives with our parents. She has moderate autism; she's verbal, but has trouble finding the right words, and she parrots a lot. She also has severe OCD that manifests in destructive ways (e.g. she will attack people to take their keys).

Today, my sister got so violent that our parents called the police. The police, in turn, called an ambulance to strap her down and take her to the hospital. I'm sure they'll give her something to knock her out, but I don't know what they will do beyond that. 

I live four hours away, so I wasn't on hand to help. When my mom called to let me know what had happened, she insisted that I not come there because I'm busy prepping for an overseas move and because there might not be anything I can do to help.

I'm terrified that my sister is only going to get worse, and that there will be nothing any of us can do to help. My mother takes her to psychiatrists and neurologists all the time, and she's medicated pretty heavily. However, so much of the therapy we've come across requires a certain amount of cognitive skills that my sister simply does not possess.

924,Personal responsibility ,"I work with adults who have Autism, Ld's and generally challenging behaviours. I specifically Key work for one individual. He struggles with personal responsibility, a quick example -
We were in a park the other week and a football rolled towards us, i was going to kick it back to the people using it but i could see John going towards it and thought it'd be cool for him to get involved in helping someone unknown. But John happened to kick the ball quite hard, and in completely the opposite direction. The direction he kicked it in happened to have a mother playing with her little girl, and the ball went square into the face of the daughter (about 7 years old) Obviously the mother was shocked, the girl didn't do anything (she was too shocked i think!) the people who owned the ball were confused and John didn't really know what to do.
John began to talk quite loudly, saying everything was fine and i was able to calm him and have him resuming the swing we were playing on within a minute. However, i stressed that he should apologise for what had happened, because the mother and the girl would be confused. John tried to inflict the blame onto everything but himself (even a near by tree was brought into question) and John repeatedly said that he wasn't going to get into trouble for this. Again, i stressed that it wasn't a question of trouble, merely letting the mother know that you made a mistake, so that she would be aware of what had happened.
It took about 5 / 10 minutes to finally get John to go and apologise for what had happened. And for him to apologise is quite good....
What i was wondering though was whether this kind of behaviour ( difficulty accepting personal responsibility ) was a common trait of autism (where i work it is) and whether anyone here has taken steps personally to come to terms with this type of thing... cheers",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/136de8/personal_responsibility/,665
925,I don't want to be tested or diagnosed.,"I probably don't have autism.  I don't really know much about it, but I think I function just fine and naturally in society.  However, the topic of me being autistic to some degree has come up multiple times.  

I feel like if I don't officially get diagnosed then I won't really be autistic.  Not sure if that makes any sense.  I know that autism is a real thing, but we've seemed to have broadened our definition of it.  This makes me wonder if people who are ""on the spectrum"" really count as autistic or not?  Are we just attributing unpopular personality traits to a mental disorder without proper cause?  If I am autistic, then that is a scary thought too.  That brings into question my whole being.  Who am I really if I'm just the result of a brain problem?  I probably don't believe in free will, but being autistic would certainly pull that into question.  I didn't have a choice of responding correctly to a given social situation; I'm autistic!  I don't know how I feel about that ""excuse"".  It takes the control away from me.

Like I said, though, I think I function fine.  I have typical Redditor issues you might find in /r/foreveralone.  I don't fully get social cues.  I might be awkward/uncomfortable in social situations.  I'm a bit of a misanthrope.  I entertain notions of solipsism.  

So, the reason it's an issue now is that I recently had a phone call with my mom where she seemed to hint that I was hurting her somehow while being completely unaware of it.  She once said that I was like House, from House.  And she's also mentioned that I'm like GOB from Arrested Development.  Now, she's watching Dexter and says I'm like Dexter.  Part of me thinks that she's just substituting television people for me since she doesn't have regular contact with me.  But today she said that I was like House and Dexter, but more like Dexter because the difference is that House knows he's hurting people.  And this surprised me because I am not hurting anyone.  Apparently, I can go days, months even without talking to someone and it doesn't bother me.  I don't miss them.  She interprets this as not really loving people.  She wonders if I can love people.  She also says that my grandma and dad are similar.  They can both be fine never hearing from people they care about.  I don't like the idea of hurting my mom, but at the same time I think her logic is non-existent.  How can I hurt someone by doing nothing?  My argument would be that she's choosing to be hurt.

926,My 4 yr old Son has Global Development Delay. I need some advice,"He is 4 years old, but at the level of a 3 year old, with his fine and gross motor skills. His behaviour is similar to a child going through their terrible twos. He is very particular about everything. He doesn't eat most foods, no meat, no vegetables, only certain fruit, lots of bread and cheese, sometimes yogurt. If he has an idea in his head he has to go through with it, or he has a meltdown (screaming, hitting himself, throwing things, kicking, etc). For example, if he wants to open the door and someone else does it, he freaks out. We have to close the door and let him do it. We try and talk him through the episodes but not always with success. 
Basically the problem I am having, and have had a very hard time getting to the bottom of, is potty training, and stopping him from getting up very early to watch tv or play playstation. 
He refuses to potty train, i have recently been able to get him wearing underwear, and sitting on the toilet, but he either purposely goes in his undies or waits for his diaper then goes. He fights when its time to change his diaper. He seems to enjoy having a poopy diaper, and fights when i try to check if he needs changing.I have tried rewards, and cheerios in the toilet, stickers, dad/brother showing him how, his 21 month old sister is starting to potty train and he just plays with the door with her instead of actually using the toilet. He sees everything as a game. I try and discipline him for bad behaviour such as hurting the cats and he laughs and continues to do it. We have to supervise him all the time, because he will do things he knows he isn't supposed to do. He will wake up at like 4am and sneak downstairs to watch tv, or play playstation, and as soon as he hears us get up, run back to his room. I have caught him taking food from the kitchen as well. I have put up baby gates, and baby locks, but he knows how to get/break out. I can't lock him in his room, its a fire hazard and some would classify it as abuse. I need to find a way to show him bed time is for sleeping, and to get me when he wakes up so i know he is safe. It's exhausting. 

I guess my question is how do i potty train him, and how do i keep him in his room at night? ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/134mvs/my_4_yr_old_son_has_global_development_delay_i/,489

928,Father of a 6-year old with autism.,"Hey all. My son has autism. He's very high-functioning but his biggest roadblocks are communication and social behavior.  He's in school now and they work with him a lot, I've been seeing many improvements. Often times when one of us (myself, his mother, or grandparents) he is just a bear to deal with.  I want to get additional therapy for him, but my insurance doesn't cover much so I can't afford the deductible. He's also on Medicaid, but that doesn't cover ABA therapy, unfortunately, because it's not medically necessary.  

Does anybody know of any places where I could get help? Even if it's books, websites, etc. where myself and the rest of his family can work with him.  We've been trying to teach him ASL to help him communicate better.  He can speak, but usually only repeats things he hears on television or on the computer.

931,Autism and Fibromyalgia,"Hello :)

I'm a 19 year old female with Asperger's and a somewhat hectic life. I currently attend university, which is where I recently noticed a sudden problem. I used to be able to walk to classes without any issue, but recently I can't get half way there without the muscles in my legs cramping up so severely that I can no longer walk. After I take a break I'm able to go the rest of the way and my next rest is in my seat before class begins. 

A visit to the doctor and some research online is pointing toward the onset of Fibromyalgia. There's muscle pain and weakness, especially after exercise, as well as stiffness after remaining in one position too long. The tender spots all match up, as well as the occasional numbness in the extremities. There's jaw pain, irritable bowels, fatigue, anxiety, memory and concentration problems, and sensitivities to lights, noises, and cold. 

Research also shows that there's a link to Autism Spectrum disorders and Fibromyalgia. I had never heard of it before and found it pretty interesting. 

So... Those of you that have an ASD or a loved one with with an ASD, do any of you have Fibromyalgia as well?

932,I don't understand where this is coming from.,"Admittedly, I know nothing about autism. I have never known anyone with autism or been around anyone with autism. This is why I am here.


My 2 year old twins had a wellness checkup today. This is the first time we have seen this pedi because we recently moved.

When the pedi entered the exam room, my son was throwing a tantrum because I wouldn't let him have my phone. He throws massive fits, kicking and screaming. He calmed down right after she entered the room.

The check up was brief, but right before she left the pedi told me she thinks he is displaying signs of autism and the office will be calling me in the next week or with a referral to a specialist.

She then says something to the effect of ""Good day"" and leaves the room before I have a chance to ask any questions, even about my own concerns.

I caught up with her in the hallway as we were leaving and asked what signs he was showing. She said the way he was throwing a fit and that he didn't talk much at all. Left again. I was kind of dumbfounded, otherwise I would have asked more questions.

The appointment lasted all of 15 minutes, is that really enough time to determine if a child has autism?  I know nothing about autism, and I don't want to assume I know more than a doctor, but does it count for anything that I know my child better than she does? Or does it not work that way?

As far as his talking, I had intended on bringing that up if the appointment hadn't been so quick. I've been concerned he has a hearing problem because he doesn't talk much, and when he does talk the words are either ""vague"" (for lack of a better term - ""ma"" instead of ""mom"" ) or they are pronounced wrong. (For example, he says ""ganana"" instead of ""banana"" or ""gruh"" instead of ""brother"") 

His fits are really nothing new to me, he is high strung but I never figured that would mean anything serious. I am the exact same way, and have been since very early childhood as well. (I actually have a panic/anxiety disorder and OCD and kind of wonder if he is inheriting that from me from time to time.)

I have been obsessively googling since the appointment but I still feel like I'm missing something. Just based on this link, http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/asd.cfm , it doesn't make sense to me. He doesn't talk frequently, but he smiles, he points, he shows a very wide variety of facial expressions. Even without his talking, he still finds a way to get his point across and let me know what he needs. (Even if it's just pointing at the pantry and crying if he wants a snack.) No issues with eye contact, either.

The only issues he has interacting with people, is a very specific few that he does not like, and thus will not tolerate. Other than that, this kid has never met a stranger.

His twin was with him, and they are nothing alike, in any way. His twin is a lot more energetic and talkative whereas my son is a bit more laid back and tends to keep to himself. I have issues with friends and family members constantly trying to compare them. Could the contrast between the two have affected the pedi's reasoning?



I hope this okay to post here. I don't want my own ignorance towards ASD or anything to cloud my judgment in this situation. I feel like I'm missing something and every result on google says the same thing. Could the pedi have possibly seen something I have not seen?

Enlighten me. I'm not thinking of refusing the visit with the specialist, I read in any case that they will test his hearing throughout the process. Is it really possible he is on the spectrum without having some of the most common indicators?

Any advice, input, and opinions would be greatly appreciated. I feel a bit like I'm in over my head and I really have no idea what the fuck is going on. I'm worried that my lack of understanding is convincing me that he does not have it. When in reality, if he does, I just want him to get the help he needs.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/12x4by/i_dont_understand_where_this_is_coming_from/,59

940,What are some good practices to help develop people skills?,"I enjoy doing write ups. It's getting me into collage, it makes me feel better when I'm upset, and it helps me express when I otherwise can't. I'm not good at explaining or describing things in my write ups, but others really enjoy reading them for some reason. I don't know why, but my stories and journals seem so interesting to them.

Why do people call me artistic, creative, witty, smart, and over all talented when I keep getting criticized because I'm not out spoken? Some people say I'm stupid and senseless because I think so uniquely, while others would say I'm brilliant and intelligent because I think so uniquely. I don't get it. People go on, on how talented I am when I make something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/fuYzD.jpg), but go on, on how I won't get anywhere in life because I don't have people skills. People skills? Do I really need them? I'm already good at what I do.

Yeah, this makes sense. Let's take jobs for example. I loved going to work... well, sort of. I haven't hated anywhere I worked or what I did there, but what I did hate was interacting with others. It was so frustrating with me and others, I would get fired. No boss wants an employee who is so isolated, that instructions often need to be repeated, and explained. ""You should know better by now, it's so easy. All you do, is ask them. Is that so hard? It's common sense. Why don't understand day to day life? I don't get it, your autism is no excuse. You need to be outspoken, if you're going to continue to work."" I'm not applying for anything fancy, just something that will get me cash while I go to collage. I'll do dishes, labour, or anything in between. I apply for places that are hiring, and what I feel I'm good at. My resume is really well done, from what I hear. I have experience, but I've never gotten a job on my own until now. I can get to the interview, but that's where it ends. It's as far a I get.

So if people skills will allow me to get, and keep a job, than how do I practice them? I know some social anxieties are caused, because people worry too much about what others think of them because they feel they're fat or feel they're not pretty enough, and others feel their personality is lacking confidence. I don't think I'm like that. I look like [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/Qgjog.jpg), and I think I'm pretty sexy. People call me smart, creative, witty, things like that, and love my stories. Isn't that a personality? I don't have some dark background, I was raised by a loving family, even if they do get frustrated with me. Why is talking to people so hard? Why is understanding people so hard? My grand parents, my family, and strangers, they can interact with each other so easily. How? I seem so good at figuring things out for myself, like art, or how the universe works, but social interaction is not one of them.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/12rgjc/what_are_some_good_practices_to_help_develop/,673

Testing reveals that my 14yo is at grade level or has grade-level capabilities. But sensory issues, very rigid thinking, slow processing, and social anxiety make school an overwhelming experience. Forced attendance has led to major depression with suicidal thoughts. Add to that some challenging home life issues and rocky relationships with certain family members.

At home, his main goal is to ""escape the real world"" through video gaming. The games, his room, our small, quiet home and our very quiet, routine, introverted life are his world. He has 1 friend IRL (although that friend, NT, seems to be slipping away) and a very few  long-term online friends.

Have any of you always been basically normal in that regard but still received a ""full"" dx of autism or asperger's (ie not PPD-NOS)?  I ask this because its always been my understanding that imaginative play is typically very limited or not present at all in young children with ASD.  However, my son started doing it at the normal age and never stopped.  He clearly has many other features of autism, but I had assumed that the obvious presence of imaginative play would probably indicate PPD-NOS when his diagnosis comes through in December.  BUt the SLP who did a full diagnostic evaluation last week seemed to feel otherwise-- that autism would be the best fit for him.  (The actual final dx will be given by an MD in December, so of course she might disagree with the SLPs intuition).

I know these distinctions are mostly just semantic, and will disappear with the new ASD diagnosis next year.  But it's led me to wonder about your perspective on the whole issue of imaginative play in young children and autism.

Although I can drive, I HAVE to memorize routes exactly, making even slight deviations of a route sends me hysterical, I also have a LOT of trouble reasoning directions, getting turned around on the road feels like a death sentence for me.

But it isn't just math and driving. I can't cook Reddit, nor can I swim, or ride a bike, in fact, I typically just don't learn things. I have tried learning to swim on several occasions, cooking feels terrifying to me, and I don't understand how I can not learn these types of activities when I have BUILT computers; it is like I am the exact opposite of a normal skillset.

What is the most damning is that my social skills are not horrible, they are almost borderline okay, although I do often have a damn hard time figuring out what I say ""wrong"". I also have gotten really good at reading people's emotions, a skill I didn't not pick up until I was 15.

But now I find myself unemployed for the last 15 months, I can't find a job, and what is worse is that even if I do, I don't know if I could ""do it"". I know I could never work at McDonald's, probably the lowest of skill jobs out there because I could never be comfortable in the environment, and could never handle the pacing.

I have been giving serious thought to disability, but I WANT to work, but I am also scared that I can never succeed. All I have ever worked have been low paying retail jobs, Sometimes I feel like I can do better, and other times I realize that I cannot.

What do I do Reddit?

Would I even qualify for disability because of the fact that I have had jobs and a degree? Have I pretended for so long that I have screwed myself over the long term?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/12izgs/i_was_diagnosed_as_a_child_as_high_functioning/,59
954,"Questions about ""meltdowns""","Autism wasn't a thing when I was growing up.  I see and hear a lot more about it now.  Whenever I watch videos with parents talking about their autistic child, they tend to focus a lot on the meltdowns.  I'm not a parent, but I can empathize.

I'm just curious, for those of you who had meltdowns as a child (I didn't), as an adult, are you able to look back on them with anymore clarity, and offer advice to parents?  Children aren't able to communicate a mature and insightful explanation to exactly why they're screaming and thrashing around, but maybe we can?

I never had meltdowns as a child, but as an adult, I often get what I can best describe as ""whole body restless leg syndrome.""  I just go into this mode where I want to tense all my muscles and everything just feels ""off"".  It makes me want to go sit in a closet and scream and cry while tensing all my muscles, and then eventually I get to a point where I can relax.  I have a hard time explaining it as an adult, I can imagine it's even harder for a child.  I've always wondered if this might be a cause for some of the meltdowns.  

As an adult, I've developed some work arounds, because it's not appropriate to scream and cry at work.  I'm not sure if this is something that kids can express or rationalize, but if you feel as though your child (or you) experiences something like this, these are some things that help me.

1. Removing as much stimulation as possible.  NT's think it's weird, but nothing can calm me down quicker than hiding in a closet.  It's dark, normally quiet, it's a closed in space and I can focus on calming down without the distractions of everything else attacking me.  There's nothing wrong with it.

2. Sometimes it helps when my husband either sits on my legs or lays on top of me completely.  It took him awhile to believe that yes, I want ALL of his body weight on me, and I want the world to continue as normal.  But once he accepted the idea, it really does help.  I can't explain it.  We'll be sitting on the couch and I'll feel this come on, and he sits on my legs with all of his weight and it forces them to not move.  I can tense my muscles easier, and it doesn't hurt as bad.  While he does this, he just keeps watching TV and acting like everything is normal.  If it gets really bad, he'll lay on top of me, full weight.  I can't explain why this works, but it does.

Is this sort of thing helpful?  Is there anything else anyone can contribute to parents to help ease some of the more outwardly hard aspects of raising an autistic child?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/12iqlt/questions_about_meltdowns/,151

961,My 9 year old autistic brother killed my kitten. How do I stop his animal abuse?,"My mother and I took in a kitten we found that was about 2 weeks old and named it Calie. My younger brothers, all of them, knew that nobody was allowed to touch her because she was too small. But when she was about 3 months old, my brother, diagnosed as PDD-NOS, got upset. He decided to take Calie, put her in a pillowcase (he was afraid of getting scratched), climb to the top of his closet, and drop her. He put her back into the bathroom where we'd been keeping her since she was still small, and we found her hurt about ten minutes later. We rushed her to the emergency vet where they pronounced her dead, with bruised lungs and a punctured heart. We didn't find out what he did until hours later when he finally told us.

My mother and I have had a hard time dealing with this. She's been worse off than me. She's taken up fostering kittens to cope, and she's doing an amazing job. We recently took in 4 kittens, all less than 3 weeks old.

My brother keeps trying to touch them and play with them and screams and acts out when we won't let him. He doesn't understand that he can't touch any of the cats because of what he did to Calie. He has also kicked my full grown cat (about a year old) when he's upset. I'm not sure how to deal with him and it's really frustrating.

962,Looking for sensitive solution to issues with an autistic neighbour,"Hey guys, I'm a bit worried sick here. I typed up a long post explaining everything in detail, but lost it with a chrome crash. I'll go through the basics and hope it makes sense.

In April this year I bought my first house, and it's just ideal. I'm not on a lot of money and I needed a two car garage for my main car and a Camaro I've been restoring for ten years. The people are great, the neighbours are great, the location is fine and I could afford it with help from my parents.

In the middle of September I came home from work and found an old ford fairlane parked in my garage. Neighbours told me it belonged to the guy two houses up (where there's no garage, just a driveway into the back yard). It turns out the owner is autistic, in his 40s, and had been in hospital since before I moved in. He'd only just come home again where he lives with his parents. He owns the fairlane but doesn't drive it on the road (it's unregistered) and it used to belong to the previous owner of my house (I'll call him Mr C) who let him have it after he got too old to drive it. The previous owner had also let him park it in the garage for more than fifteen years.

Short story is I couldn't get the guy to move his car, he kept falling back on having permission from Mr C and it needs to be garaged or it'll rust, so I had a couple of mates help me move it to his parents front lawn and I locked my garage. The autistic guy had a major meltdown over that and for two days we had wailing and yelling and I'd find the fairlane parked in my driveway or in front of my house. Autistic guy was hanging around my garage trying to get in to put his car away. His parents are kind and good people, so after talking it through with them and another couple of neighbours, I relented and let him park the fairlane in my garage again for a while. They said it'd give them time to fix things and settle their son down. Several times a day for more than a month he's been checking in my garage windows to see his car is still there, but he isn't a problem other than that.

Now it's Sunday the 28th October, and on Tuesday my Camaro is being delivered to my new place after all its bodywork has been done, and I need the fairlane out of there. The fairlane's owner or his parents haven't found a solution about the car, and I'm offside with two other neighbours who think I'm being selfish wanting to get it out because I'm single with two cars, and there's a lot of tension in the neighbourhood. My direct neighbours on both sides think the fairlane should be towed and scrapped or at least locked back in the owner's back yard under a car port where it'd been while he was in hospital. Before all this happened I'd been ignorant of autistic people, so I've been googling myself mad trying to figure out a solution. From what I can tell this guy depends on routine and one of the strong parts of his revolves around owning that car and keeping it garaged in my garage. Without that, he's a problem his elderly parents can't cope with. With it, he seems to get on well with most of the neighbourhood and they can all live together peacefully.

I have to get his car out and this problem solved by Tuesday lunchtime. Help, reddit, I'm at a loss. Legally I know I fully have the right to have the car towed, and it may be scrapped as it's a wreck and its registered owner (the guy who used to own my place) is dead. If I do that it's going to give the autistic guy's parents all kinds of problems they haven't had for fifteen something years, and make two sets of neighbours hate me. If I leave it there I'm defeating the purpose of the house I bought. I don't have the knowledge or skills to work around this guy, and from what I can glean online that's the essence of his parents' problem too.

What's the ethical and right thing to do here? What can I do to change autistic guy's habits?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1278lc/looking_for_sensitive_solution_to_issues_with_an/,682

964,"My son is moving into a class setting more appropriate for him, just sharing my happiness.  ","My son is three and a half, he was diagnosed autistic at two years old.  Last year he started school after the winter break, and he was in a small class, out of our district, with a couple other young children with various disabilities.  He did really well, loved school, and it seemed to help him a lot.  His language expanded and he improved his motor skills a bit.  For this year he was transferred to another district and placed in a normal Head Start program with a class of 17-18 neurotypical kids.  I was getting close to calling up the school and having a meeting to see what could be done, because I've noticed he is much more upset and agitated this year compared to last.  I felt it was just far too much for him.  But then his speech therapist called me up yesterday and said that while the state requires a ""try and see how it works"" approach to see if kids can handle a regular setting, it's not working at all for my son and the poor little guy cannot learn anything because he's so overwhelmed by the other children and the fact that his class moves at a pace much faster than he can handle.  Starting November 5th he will be moved to a special education class in our own district, and he will get daily speech therapy instead of once a week.  The other children will be more like him and the class will move at a pace he can handle.  I am just so happy right now, and relieved that the schools and staff (therapists from both districts met) have worked together and come to the conclusion that this is best for him, without me having to make all kinds of demands.  With a lot of frustrations day to day, I just had to share my happiness with some folks who might understand!  My little guy does enjoy school, it just has to be in the proper setting for him instead of everything just blowing past him and leaving him behind.

965,I hate having Aspergers syndrome,"I have Aspergers syndrome, I was diagnosed after starting school and I've always hated it. I've had no friends most of my life, except for fake friends who truly cared little to none about me. I've been to the point of suicide before, I've had depression most of my life. I'm also gay. And I live in Kentucky. So all of it has built up and made my life hard. Tonight I dealt with more problems that I'm facing because I'm autistic, because I have trouble seeing social signs that I should see, and I've gotten completely drunk just so the pain would go away.
Earlier tonight a girl I believed to be my friend texted me to tell me to be careful at her housewarming party, to not be stupid or get upset at what she was saying. She however never made it clear that she didn't want me to go to her party. So I got ready, got some friends, and drove to her house. As soon as I got there, I was told to leave please because I was not welcome. I was shocked, I had no idea why I was being asked to go but I left. I asked my friend why I was asked to go, since she told me I could go days ago and showed her her text where she never said she wasn't uninviting me. I left, went back to my dorm with some friends and texted her saying how much that had hurt me and how I don't understand why she had done it. I will now show you her response:

Why do you think i didnt invite you, all you do is act silly, i was trying to uninvite you nicely but i guess you just dont get it that you upset people, your rude, and you make not funny comments that offend people, i know you have a problem but its not good for my party. I dont care or give one fuck if your not my friend, all you talk about is your sex life anyway and try to brag about your 'new guys' that no one gives a fuck about. Most those people didnt want you there, they dont know you,or dont like you, im not having them be upset when we could just do something later.

I asked her why she's saying she didn't invite me after she had invited me, twice! Her response was that she was ""fucked up"" and didn't know why she hadn't clearly stated I was uninvited on her text. Also know that I knew half the people there, and that what she was stating is very over exaggerated.
I cried for almost an hour before I got to the point where I was drunk enough to not feel the pain anymore. I know it's not healthy to do so, but it's kept me from crying my eyes out all night.

I'm upset because this has happened all my life, it never stops, it never will. That's why I hate have AS, I can't stand not understanding that when I'm saying something that its pissing someone off. I don't mean to, I don't want to, but sometimes I do it. I hate myself for having this problem, I hate myself for everything. I'm not suicidal, I promise but I just hate myself as a person and its hard to keep dealing with all the drama that I'm having to face. It hurts so much to deal with everything that I have to deal with because I'm autistic, because I just can't see when I'm doing something wrong that's hurting others. I've gotten better at signs, I try to make sure that Im not upsetting people but sometimes it just can't be stopped.

968,Question for those on the spectrum - what therapeutic approach do you feel has the most value for kids (or adults) with ASD?,"I am interested in pursuing a career working with children and adults with autism spectrum disorders.  I have an autistic older brother who did not receive ABA, OT, or other behavioral interventions as a child, but did receive speech therapy in school and was in a special education program.  Consequently, I don't have any experiences, directly or indirectly, with most of the various types of therapy available to people on the spectrum today.

However, I do have some knowledge of the different therapeutic approaches for ASD, and to be honest, I find the strictly behavioral approaches to be too focused on eliminating behaviors that superficially mark the individual as autistic, even though they may be functional for the child in a way that a neurotypical person doesn't (or can't) fully appreciate.  For this reason I tend to feel more aligned with interventions that focus more on building and sustaining social/interpersonal skills, facilitating communication, etc.  I suppose SCERTS, DIR/Floortime and related therapeutic models would fall under the umbrella of what I personally find more up my alley.  I am also interested in occupational therapy as a field of practice.

All this being said, I realize that my inexperience with these various types of therapies means that I don't have much grounds on which to judge them.  For that reason I am curious - what does r/autism think about the various types of therapies available to kids and adults on the spectrum?  I am particularly curious to hear from those who are on the spectrum themselves.  If you received services as a child (or receive them now), what types of interventions, if any, do you feel make the biggest impact?  Which forms of therapy currently available do you feel hold the most promise for autistic children?

I really hope not to upset or offend anyone by this post.  I just feel that the results of studies measuring the success of various therapeutic methods can only inform us up to a certain point, and that as a neurotypical person myself, the only way for me to gain perspective on what is ""effective"" is to include people with autism in the conversation.  And if I am ever to work with autistic kids, I never want to do so in a way that causes them to feel stigmatized or deficient.  Thanks very much to anyone who provides their input!

Suggestions to make life easier for him and the family.,"I recently visited my sister, husband, and their son for  a few days- and autism became a somewhat faceless title to a frustrating situation that I wish I could help. The time I was there, I exhausted myself, being that he couldn't sleep through the night, the fits he had hourly due to unknown stimuli which upset him, and his allergies to gluten and caseyn (in dairy?) I have since returned home, halfway around the globe, and have lost hours of sleep thinking of how hard and lonely it is for my sister, and how a child cannot communicate their needs, resulting in what it seems misery. 

I'm very sorry I cannot be their for them physically, but by researching on the internet that he does a sort of obsessive spinning, realized there are toys to stimulate vestibular senses, and tried to find offbrand cheaper alternatives- and the whole process of learning and trying to navigate products can be overwhelming.

Also, my sister works full time, and I noticed lunch packing in the morning for her (she packs for her husband, herself, and the toddler) was incredibly stressful while she had to qualm his moodswings- and I wanted to know of products I could send her to make packing a lunch so much easier, premade sort of things via amazon to pop into a container.

How does one do this? Maybe this means I'm stupid. I have an idea! My computer! I love my computer. I love computers in general. They way they work, what they're used for, computers are just wicked! Want to know how a computer works? I can go on about computers all day! Oh, I was explaining something... um... well... Oh, Speaking of computers, did you know the human brain is estimated to hold the memory of over 2 petabytes? Ever heard of a petabyte? A terabyte even? A terabyte is 1000 gigabytes. A petabyte is 1000 terabytes! No single computer has the capacity to hold even one of these bad boys. 1 Pedabyte is every photo on Facebook, and every video on Netflix available to stream. Basically, The brain is just a very, very powerful computer, created by nature. Oh, I love computers they're amazing! Since the brain is just a super computer, this means the brain is programable? This is commonly known as ""natural instinct"". The thing our brains are programmed to do. One of them being; faces. A face? Yes, recognizing faces. We all know what a face is. A face, is a face, which is a face. It doesn't take much to recognize what a face is. (--&gt; [:)](http://www.google.ca/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=happy+face&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=Qd6AUIUapvLIAZyigIgP&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=680&amp;sei=Q96AUO2uJ8KiyAGhyoCQCw) &lt;--) To just two dots and a line, to that dude who looks familiar but you forget his name. Humans are built/programmed to recognize even the smallest of changes on a face. It let's us figure out emotion, and stuff. For me... not so much. I don't understand what... what ever that frown means when I try to make you smile. What if I'm just programmed differently? Nah, that's silly. I'm just stupid. I can't even figure out if this meat I'm eating is horse, or something else. ""I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse"" he said. I'm kind of nervous, now. Anyway, I think we should learn how to count in binary in math class. I'm pretty good at math. I wish I was at english. Sometimes, to show off, I count out loud using 1's and 0's. Binary is simple, really. It's like the decimal system, but instead of 10 digits, than repeating it's self after 11, binary repeats after 2 digits. Computers only have two fingers you know. 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101. I just counted to five. I can show you how to convert binary, but it's so long to explain, and you're probably not as interested as I am. What am I saying? Society says I'm stupid, and it's clear that I am. I need to be more active, they all say. What do they mean by that? Aren't I active now? Man, I wish it was easy to walk up to someone and say hi. That boy who sits beside me in class, I think he likes computers too. He's seems pretty cool. Even if I did say hi to him, then what? Hi again? Now that I think about it, I think my math grade is low, too. All we ever do is graph things, and these stupid words, I don't know what they mean. After all, I am pretty stupid. I can never focus to these lectures, it's so hard because I don't know what the teacher is talking about. My brain may be a computer, but it's not a calculator. Lots go through my head, enough that it keeps me occupied. I have nearly unlimited patience. Patterns on the ceiling above my bed are so interesting. Looking at them keeps my head busy, even in the middle of a conversation. There's so much to think about. I could count them. Let's see, they're circle shaped. That means the length of the window of is the same size of less than three and a half of these shapes. It looks like the length is the same if one of these shapes rolled, it would roll once. That's pi? I wish my grandmother would stop trying to change me. She knows I'm different, but she doesn't know how. If it was as easy to talk to people as much as it was for her, than I'd have tons of friends by now. It's 2 am, and I can't sleep because her criticism makes me feel like I'm a bad person. It's not like I do drugs, or smoke, or have the urge to vandalize. So what if I don't have many friends, or the fact I spend most of my time on computers. Am I hurting people? I don't hate her, but I think she fells I do. She wonders why I don't say hi, bye, or good morning to her, and I wish I knew why, too. Am I bad person? ""I ask because you don't tell me things"" she says. Please, continue asking. I don't mind. I can't really speak out anyway. I can't tell her I don't like being touched when she tries to hug me, but that doesn't mean I don't hate her. I lack in confidence, because this world we live in confuses me.

I hope this was insightful... This is to my grandmother who can't seem to figure me out, and trust me, if I knew how, I'd let you know everything that goes through my mind.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/11qi7l/you_have_autism_wow_i_didnt_know_that/,673

987,Is this typical?,"**I don't mean for this to be crass; please realize I haven't had much interaction with handicapped individuals**

Today I was waiting to be seen in a doctor's office. In walks a mother with three children who all sit on the opposite side of the room from me. The three children are all playing together as normal children do. Then a mother (or caregiver) and an (I'm assuming) autistic adult walk in. They sit next to me, which I have no issues with. The mother/caregiver fills out the paperwork to see the doctor and the autistic daughter sits there. 

The autistic daughter stands up and looks at her mother/caregiver and the caregiver says, ""do you need to go to the bathroom? Let's go to the bathroom."" They go to the only door in the lobby, which is locked, and the daughter begins pulling on the handle. The nurse then opens the door for her. The mother and daughter come back a few moments later and sit next to me again. The daughter gets up, walks across the room, and throws one of the children playing on the ground. The little boy cries and stares at the autistic woman because he's confused and upset, but does not otherwise react.

The nurse opens the glass window and quietly calls the caregiver/mother and daughter over and asks if there is any way to control the girl's outbursts. The autistic woman walks over to me (which I thought she was returning to her seat) and pulls my arm and yanks me out of my chair. The nurse then calls the mother/caregiver over again and they bring her back to an exam room and the nurse asks me if the autistic woman can move ahead of me in line. Of course I agree.

A few minutes later, I am called back to a separate exam room and my vitals are taken. Within a few minutes, I hear the mother saying, ""come on Andrea, back to the room"" and the doctor told her ""I'm sorry ma'am, she's just too much to handle for us. Try bringing her to the ER"". The doctor then came in to my room and told me the girl had hit her, was throwing things, etc.

Unless you knew me really well, you probably wouldn't know I was autistic. Most people just think I'm quirky because I'm brilliant. I'm not so sure I'm brilliant, but that's what people have always said.

Yet, I have a lot of problems every day. I have terrible anxiety when I'm around other people (except a handful), and I have a bit of a panic attack or meltdown when it comes to having certain responsibilities (needing to be somewhere at a certain time, things like that). 

Currently, I'm nearly finished with my BS in computer programming from an online college, but I feel like the knowledge of my field is subpar. Though I try to improve, I'm completely devoid of guidance and this limits me greatly. I have not been able to find the help I need, and I'm scared I won't be able to work the job anyway.

I know that I am unable to work other jobs. I have tried a great deal of them and nearly all of them have ended on the first day, usually with a panic attack. 

I've been lucky enough to be approved for SSID, but it's not nearly enough money. I have the cheapest apartment I could possibly find, but I need to get out of here. There's noise all the time and there are people all around, just on the other side of these thin, un-insulated walls. Rent, electricity, and internet, a few miscellaneous bills total about the same amount as my income. 

I just want to live a normal life. I want my own home, one that I'm comfortable in, and I want to pay my own bills and I want enough money left over to pursue my interests. How on earth can I make it happen?

I can't be the only one with these problems. On this subreddit, I often see thread after thread about parents asking for advice for their autistic children. Where are the autistic adults?

He doesn't use it often, infact it had been a whole week before he noticed it was gone. Last night when he discoved it missing he freaked out. Tore up the whole house looking, went back and forth to his car to look at least three times, and stayed up all night worrying that he had done something terrible to it. Stomping all around the house like a child who had lost a stuffed animal.

I have never encounted this before. I managed to talk him down and get him to sleep for work saying that maybe he left it there, but now it's not and i don't know how to reassure him everything will be okay when we get home from work.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/10xzxr/need_help_on_how_to_calm_down_someone_about_a/,59
1007,Young Mother with an Autistic Child.,"A girl I went to school with had a child at the age of 20. From early on she realized he was different. Just a few weeks ago they got the official diagnosis that he was Autistic.

1008,"Is PDD-NOS autism, or its own category?? ","My son was diagnosed with PDD-NOS (2 years. 3 months) and even with all we have read and talked to therapists and other parents, it seems to be a source of confusion and a real grey area. Is PDD-NOS autism? I understand that autistic disorders and PDD-NOS are all under the PDD category (making them sound like slightly different things) but then you read certain sources calling in mild autism?! I don't know how I should consider it in my head, or try to explain it to others. If he was having a meltdown bc of sensory issues I'd probably explain why to whom ever it was in front of at the time, as if to say ""I'm sorry he has _____, it makes him very sensitive to &gt;&gt;insert sensory trigger here&lt;&lt;&lt;"" but to just say PDD-NOS, I think people would look at me like I'm crazy. But I don't want to breed confusion and misunderstanding if I say its autism or perhaps ""like"" autism. Honestly I don't know. I've noticed this seems to be a question other families we have met have about their diagnosis and either never asked or never got a straight answer.

1009,"First timer here, just got the news.","Hi guys. just found out my son has autism. I don't really know what to do or how to proceed. I am separated from my son's mother and just heard the news not even an hour ago.

My son seems pretty normal to me - he is almost 5, has some issues with speech but is very friendly, happy and smart! he loves technology, video games, and likes talking with me when we are together. He does have issues with potty training but its only when he is dropping a deuce.

I just never had to think about this before - I dont know where to turn and the wikipedia article is pretty damn verbose when explaining autism. 

I just am curious - what should i expect? should i expect anything? what kind of things have you guys done to help your children grow? should i approach parenting any differently?

Im probably asking all the wrong questions but im a mess with everything that has happend before he was diagnosed - I just want to be the best dad I can for my son.

thanks guys.

1010,The story of Mr. Pete,"My son's name is Mr. Pete he is a 4 year old healthy young lad diagnosed with autism before he was 2. If you knew him before you would never know he would one day be on the spectrum. He walked at 9 months and said his first words before he was 1. Here is a few videos of his regressions. 
Please excuse my sideways videos I've not yet mastered the IPhone.

 http://youtu.be/AvMsEh7syx0 -Here he is at 3 months old. He has full eye contact and is very engaging. A whopping 9lbs at birth. *pinch those cheeks I will. 

http://youtu.be/uqQm4AdHQqs - Here is is at 8 months old walking with the help of a walker. He is very happy to be mobile. 

http://youtu.be/CEEIqu7l1sI - Here you can see how he is interacting with his sister and I. He even imitates well and has good eye contact. He is roughly 8 months here. 

http://youtu.be/EjoogpH1TDk - 11 months and mobile like speed racer. He counts with me and is so happy to do so. 

http://youtu.be/pHW0C39CSZM - this is about a year ago. He is 3 years old and is non verbal totally. I am sorry for the gap in time. I lost a hard drive with many many videos and photos grr..he loves to stim and sensory stuff. 

http://youtu.be/IU652NwW9pU Here is Mr. Pete today. I still try to get him to interact with me and count like he did before. His eye contact is getting better but not 100% I feel like his frustration is getting worse and his anxiety is more relevant. We can not go out to public places without him melting down. He is still not potty trained and doesn't show any signs of becoming so.... :(

Since that original post, Posco has been updated on iOS and Android. Even more exciting is that a Windows 8 version has been released. Posco is the first and only AAC app available on Windows 8 computers and tablets. You can find out about all of this at http://poscoapp.blogspot.com

Right now, I am looking to do 2 things:
1. Give out more promo codes - PM me or leave a comment and I'll be more than happy to give you one.
2. Ask anyone who purchased Posco to leave a review. Right now, my app doesn't have enough reviews to display an average 1-5 star rating. Without this average rating, my app is really hard to find in the app store. Unfortunately, people who use promo codes cannot rate my app. Again, if you bought Posco and it works well for you, I'd really appreciate a (very brief) rating in the app store. Thank you =)

Also, I got some great feedback last time. If anyone else has a suggestion or wants something to work differently, let me know and we can discuss it. I'm very open to new ideas!

My good friend has an autistic family member and has been raising money for research in every way she knows how for as long as I can remember. She's raised small amounts of money before, but set a large goal of $5,000 this year to go to the Organization for Autism Research. In order to achieve this goal, she has been training endlessly to run a marathon (on top of being a college student, working tons of hours to pay rent, etc.). 

She will be running the Chicago marathon with her father one week from today but has been discouraged since her goal of $5,000 after more than 7 months of publicity is still almost $2,000 short. 

Any financial gift would be greatly appreciated, would bring her endless happiness, and would all go towards a great cause. The link to donate (and read a small bit of her story) is here: http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/jessica-stanek/2012-bank-of-america-chicago-marathon As you can tell by the donation history, she has been really pushing it in the past few weeks but I still think she will fall short of her goal without the help of the reddit community.

If anyone has other subreddits that they'd suggest for this dream to be accomplished, please let me know. She's one of the most selfless people I know and I'd love to help her out, as well as support the OAR.

It's still barking. It's been barking for 12 hours. I've been doing all I can. I'm listening to music, but that doesn't work when I'm trying to sleep. I also use about 50 lbs of weighted blankets. 

What do I do? 

Should I write a note telling him I'm autistic? Should I phone the cops?

Long story short I am giving a presentation about seamless service in the context of services for people with ASD. Unfortunately, I am less familiar with the conditions experienced by people with ASD and their families than would be ideal for giving this presentation.

I have encountered a couple of definitions of what seamless service would mean in this context: 1) collaboration between different service providers (and stakeholders like schools, and the client) in generating and delivering a support plan, 2) the continued access to services as needs change, 3) a smooth transition to adult services of comparable quality to child services (even as an adult living more or less autonomously).

While these proposals all seem reasonable, I still don't have a good sense of what they're in response to.  Obviously, proposing that service providers should collaborate suggests that currently they don't.  I can get that far with each of the definitions.

What I don't have a good sense of is what kinds of collections of services one might be accessing and the effects of non-collaboration, for example.  Things are still too abstract for me and I am asking for your help in relating on a more concrete level.

If you're willing to share, I would appreciate your thoughts about what service challenges you've encountered and whether/how a seamless service model would be an improvement.

Please. This is right up there with ""I am like SOOO OCD."" It is right and good to wonder about yourself and where your mental patterns fall on all sorts of spectrums, but the flip side of autism awareness is an increase of dismissiveness of it, simply because of the reason that in my opinion, a bunch of misfits yearning for a label try to claim it as their own. This is not to say that I doubt the accuracy of diagnosis of people later in life (hey, it happens) or that I think doctors are the only ones who can get it right. That being said, especially with ""low-functioning"" autism (whatever that means) it is often extremely, in-your-face noticeable by the time you turn, oh, say, two years old.

1043,After seeing the article on manners... How can I get my child to say hello to people/respond when she is greeted?,"My kiddo has come leaps and bounds. But... I can't get her to respond to people's greetings. Strangers, I can *almost* understand. But for instance, my boyfriend's dad was at the house the other day and said hello to my kiddo. Nothing. She put her head down and looked at the floor. This is a person she has spent time with, etc. But he isn't in her daily life, so forget about it. basically, that is the criteria. She will talk to you, but only if you are part of what she perceives as her ""immediate"" family. 

I have finally gotten her to (quickly!) wave ""goodnight"" to a friend of ours that comes over once a week, every week. Forget speaking to him or looking at him, but she will wave in his general direction if I tell her to say good night to him when she goes off to bed and he is still there. 

She speaks just fine to me, my boyfriend, my parents (who she is very close to), her dental hygienist, her teachers, and my best friend. Outside of that, forget it. She ranges from ""I won't even look in your general direction"" to ""I will give you stilted answers to direct questions"". Oddly enough, she will have a full conversation with my boyfriend's brother, but only if neither of them think anyone else is around to hear (he is 28 with Asperger's). 

Forget speaking to her regular doctor, or a waitress, or my boyfriend's dad, or my best friend's husband, or any of our other friends. I feel like she is being rude by not at least saying ""hello"" back, or answering direct questions. I don't need her to be friendly, just polite. I've had patience for a long time, but I am starting to get ""fed up"" because I know she is capable.

1050,"I have high functioning autism, and I want to share my world with you","Hello there, My name is Corey!  And I am a 17 year old guy who just found this today, and I want to share my mind, my life, and my stories with you. I guess this could also be an AMA since i'm sure you will have questions.

To start off I will begin with how I was brought into this world, April 16th 1995, my mother is in the hospital. The doctors gave her too much anesthetic while she was in labor. She went unconscious, the doctors rushed an emergency C-section and I was without oxygen for over a minute. My parents are both small, with my dad being 5 foot 6 and my mom being 5 foot 2, but I was still small even for that. As time went on I developed extremely fast though my early childhood, beginning to speak extremely early, with full sentences, I read many many books, and was constantly asking my parents while we were out driving pointing to signs asking ""whasat say?"" I am an extremely picky eater. And for YEARS we were told I was quirky, I would grow out of it. etc.  I frequently would simply cry, scream, and not want to do things. with my parents having virtually zero clue as to why.

Fast forward to around age 6, i went to a daycare center and would frequently play with legos, building blocks, Lincoln logs etc. I played games on the computer and handheld games like Bop It! I was fascinated with the plastic shapes they had. I forget the name of them. But they are a famous series of shapes that can be connected to form countless patterns. I would arrange these in patterns for hours on end to myself, and get extremely upset if someone wanted to join in themselves and would do it wrong.  My dad had started to become fessed up with my eating behaviors and started to force it (parents, please don't do this ever. it makes the experience terrible) I was told almost daily I couldn't go to school, I would get things taken away unless i cleaned my plate, or bowl of cereal etc. This continued from about age 6 to around age 10. We finally got to see some sort of doctor who simply told him to not ever force me to eat something. But he has maintained this ""Ill do it myself cus I know how to fix him"" mindset, and it's miserable. 

Oddly even during my early elementary school years I either brought my own food from home (a peanut butter sandwich, every single day) or VERY RARELY ate the 1-2 things i liked on the school's menu. And on the days where I wasn't very hungry we had a lunch monitor who made me finish my sandwich every day before going outside. I really wish I had done something about this, as it was INCREDIBLY frustrating being told you had to eat when you didn't want to. I know why they did it though, it is because I am underwight, very slim and they see that as unhealthy, so they attempt to force me into their proper body image.

Age 13, me and my mom see a doctor at the local hospital(my mom by the way has been a wonderful parent, she actually cares and attempts to understand me) after hearing my story and asking questions. he comes to the conclusion that I have Sensory Integration Disorder, which is a sensory processing disorder, VERY closely related to autism. I get overwhelmed to what you all find ""normal"" sensory inputs. The best way i can describe it is if you have a pet peeve that you don't like people making the ""slurping"" noise through the straw at the end of their drink. Except instead of it just slightly irking you, it triggers a fight or flight response and it's either I move far away, or I stop whatever is making the noise. and it is this way for countless sounds, smells, textures, tastes etc. And now it becomes clear. No wonder I dislike so many foods, I respond to them at such a heightened level I can't deal with them. I like to eat my food alone( since my family usually doesn't also want to eat the same few foods often as the ones I do) so I don't have to look, smell, hear them eat. It explains my previous ""quirkiness"" except something never sat right about it to me. It seemed too easy. The doctor said he had only ever seen it without a connection to autism in 2 other cases. He believed I didn't have autism because i didn't exhibit any social or communication issues. And to an extent that's both true, and completely false. I can speak english perfectly fine, and when I talk to someone I have very little issues making eye contact etc. But I have a hard time making friends, I never felt like I could truly be myself, I often got teased and made fun of. and so for years i tried to be one of these ""cool"" kids. I thought if they were cool and I wasn't, all I had to do was be like them and they wouldn't tease me. I didn't really have a hard time making or keeping friends, I just never felt like people were friends with the real me. My big problems come from groups. If there's a group larger then about 15-20 people. I start to get overwhelmed by the small noises and chit-chat, by everything. I am truly an introvert. I hate working in groups because I feel i can work 10 times faster and do it my way correctly. 

So how did school go? Well to be honest. This is my biggest regret. In 2nd grade I was noticed for flying through math books etc. I was placed into a select group of gifted students who not only worked with brain teasers and puzzles(think tetris but instead of making lines you have to make a Square, or another pattern, keep in mind this is the 2nd grade still) but we also worked with algebra. yeah, algebra in 2nd grade. The algebra didn't challenge me, and I wanted to work with the brainteasers and patterns more. And for some reason i stopped going to the gifted program. I don't know why the school had me leave. But I was back to regular school where nothing challenged me still. And nothing really ever has. I am writing this at 17. I do every single math problem in my head, often faster then you can do it by writing it down. for new lessons, I would often skip ahead of the teacher and ask infront of the whole class why we weren't exploring other facets of a particular thing. I never took notes unless required for a grade, and even then only took them about half the time. It was wasted effort to me, why spend so much time writing it down when I had memorized it all just by seeing it, and understanding it. I never studied for anything. not even finals, or standarized tests. I had to find ways to game the system to create challegnes for myself, see what grade I got by rushing through the test and being the first one done (I usually finished as one of the first 5 people anyways) Or if a test was open note/open book, how I would do without them. A Health issue took me out of school for months, I was too far behind to catch up. I understood all the lessons, but the sheer amount of ""busywork"" that had piled up was too much for my easily-overwhelmed-often-highly-stressed-self to do. So i dropped out, I had already scored advanced and above for all my states standardized tests, i had already taken ACT/SAT and scored well above average. I attempted online classes that were done at 4 times the speed of normal courses at a public school, but those were too slow for me too, I couldn't motivate myself because I had no interest in doing more useless work when I already understood and wanted to move along. So i dropped that and am now simply getting a GED. I will end up finishing highschool early. In my aptitude-test for the GED to test my knowledge across various subjects to make sure I do not need to brush up on any material before I take the full on GED test. I scored as if I had already completed a year of college level courses. and my national average across the subjects ranged from 97-99th percentile. Oh and I did the 2 mathematics portions of that test all in my head as well. 

So here I am now, 17. finishing my schooling early and I have become fascinated with learning myself in the meantime(I plan to apply and attend the #2 ranked school in the US for my major starting in 2013, but I'll get to that later) I have come across temple grandin, I've read and seen movie's of hers years ago. I read another book, written by someone who has autism and synthesisia. I have taken IQ tests from Psychologists and scored a 150 IQ. All my life I have been misunderstood, and there has only ever been one person who truly understands me. my mom.

So what do I want to do with my life? Well I am big into video games. Not like playing them, sure they're great and I have fun too. But I study and analyze them. It's similar to phsycology to me. I can analyze what makes a player do what, why, for how long etc. All based on an interactive experience. I have always been drawn to a computer. I have been gaming my whole life. In december of 2011 a new blog section went up on a popular gaming community site. I joined a public chatroom to talk with the creator of the blog, and because he was going to be busy soon he needed some guest posters, I volunteered and started posting there. I was doing what I have done all along, I started getting paid for it. And now I can move on in my life, hopefully college will challenge me(I expect it to) I can attend a university and get a degree in game design. and I have found what I believe is MY purpose. 

Thanks for reading, I know it's long but I really wanted to share. Many of you might have a child who can't express how they experience the world, and while every person is different, maybe you can see how we perceive the world. I am one of the most observant people, so if you have any question, no matter how specific I will try to help you from both what my mom did to help me, and what I feel was the problem or what I did myself.

1060,Advice? My 3-year-old will undergo testing next week for Asperger's and selective mutism. ,"Autism in the form of Asperger's and severe social anxiety run on both sides of our family. My husband is undiagnosed, but is sure he has Asperger's. My nephew has it, and my husband's niece has it. Also, my husband's older niece has severe social anxiety and selective mutism.

I first noticed our daughter might have inherited it when she was ten months old and began to cry when strange people smiled at her. Today she displays severe social anxiety when in group situations, and breaks down in tears if another child tries to play with her and won't go away. She spent hours with my mother (who she hardly sees) alone after my FIL had a stroke. My mother said she hardly spoke a word during the 5 hours she had her. 

My daughter is extremely bright. She chatters up a storm at home, and is great with puzzles, the alphabet, and counting. She can read simple stories already. She also likes patterns and lines up her Hot Wheels and magnetic letters (not in order). She also has this weird habit of faceplanting on the bed and sofa. She thinks it's fun to get hit in the face with pillows, so she'll also do that to herself. She jumps on the sofa and tries hard to fly, so I take her to the gym to blow off steam. She also loves the trampoline bungee at the mall where she can bounce high in the air because it's like she's flying! 

She is extremely active. In fact, she cannot stay still. Even when she is focused on something, her body must be moving, so I also suspect some kind of ADHD or hyperactive thing going on. 

I know she is on the spectrum, and I'm asking those who have lived with autism for advice. My husband has his own experiences, but I'd like to know from others what I can do to make her life better, if not easier, in terms of learning to manage her fears.  

I don't consider autism a bad thing, but it kills me when I watch my little girl break down in inconsolable tears because she doesn't understand how to play with other children. I just want to learn some coping tools so I can pass them on to her.

1061,"I think I have an autistic intern. He struggles to do his job, and I need advice.","To make a long story short, I work with animals and just got an intern for the next 4 months or so. We had interviewed him once and he came off as a little odd but we pegged it to him being nervous and my boss offered him the internship (He honestly wouldn't have been my first choice normally but we only had 2 students apply for this semester and the other declined).

I've now worked with him for about a week, and although he has never outwardly said it, I believe he is autistic. I'll be the first to admit I am not very familiar with autism so tell me if you think these actions would suggest autism. (Multiple coworkers have approached me with that diagnosis as well). 

He is very jumpy and nervous, constantly seeming uncomfortable. He is well read and seemingly intelligent but lacks common sense about relatively straight forward things like cutting fruit (He wound up with a large knife from behind his head and slammed it down an inch from his fingers to cut a banana). He takes things very literally, and seems to confuse social cues that a 'normal' person would not think twice about. Making small talk, I asked him today what he does for fun in his spare time and his first response was to sort of moan and say ""Ohh..ahh I dunno, my head kinda hurts today."" 

The job involves a lot of feeding and caring for animals, and after about a week he hasn't shown much improvement. He regularly forgets about certain animals he is required to care for. Today when I pointed out he missed a group of animals he needs to feed everyday (and has fed daily 3 or 4 times prior) his comment was to say that he didn't even know those animals existed.

My boss doesn't trust him alone, and rightfully so based on the knife incident and other incidents that ended in the death of small animals (for instance he killed an insect in a cage door he closed on it and made the comment that the animal wasn't smart enough to get out of the way, and he has thrown away some animals with their old food after being shown how to check it), so I've had to shadow him almost non stop. He is also very slow, taking as much as ten times longer than previous interns to do daily chores.  

The goal of the internship is to give them experience but also free up time for us to do other projects, and when I'm shadowing someone and they are taking much longer to do daily tasks than if I had done it myself it makes the entire process counter productive, and instead of freeing up time for me it has been a distraction that is taking away from my other tasks.

So I guess my questions for reddit is, 
A.) does this sound like autism or something else? In case it matters the guy is in his mid/late 20's when most interns we get are around 20.
B.) If he is autistic, how likely will it be that he improves to the point where he can take care of the animals in a safe way to himself and the animals without needing constant supervision?
C.) He seems very uncomfortable, but says he enjoys himself when asked. Are we putting him in an unfair situation or environment by expecting him to be self reliant?

1062,"Working with an young autistic man - delusional, a problem?","I've been working in a residential home for people with autism recently, in particularly with one male (21yrs) I've been working with him for approx 2 months now. He constantly draws thing's and is trying to develop his own tv series from his pictures. This is great, but can also be the route of anxiety as he say's he will go mad if it doesn't work out (realistically, it's probably not going to work out) 

The manager has propagated that he is a magnificent artist, and he is always told that he is fantastic / great etc... I was with him the other day and he said that he's perfect, and he often references to how much better he is than everyone else... 

He won't accept that he has autism, it's not a subject that i've approached with him personally but i have been told that it's a sure fire way to make him very anxious and angry. 

I'm unsure about how much negative behaviour can stem from creating such a distorted view of himself and the world (he believes he's better than all the other house mates) Some of the others staff think that it's just about keeping him happy as you go along, and apparently he has drastically improved over the last 3 years (which i believe) 

So - I think some of the thing's where i work have done are ace, and they do really care.... But i was wondering about opinions as to whether (in your opinions) there should be plans to get him to confront his autism, and dilute the amount of praise he get's for certain things

1066,"Question about how to deal with emotions, or lack of their expression. ","Hello,

I am a 23, soon to be 24, year old male who has been diagnosed with PDD-NOS and NLD. 

I should probably write some background first:

In the past I have had major social issues that were visible to all. Lack of eye contact, behavior that was just a little 'off' and made people find me strange, fits of rage and problems with empathy.

Because I didn't fit in, I decided to try and 'fix' these issues. Now, I cannot change the way my brain is wired and as such I cannot 'cure' my PDD-NOS, but I have, over the years, trained myself in acting in a more socially acceptable way. It has resulted in me being a lot more accepted in social settings, often even liked a lot. I can get around social life with only rare cases of people giving me a strange look now and the times I tell people of my condition, they often refuse to believe it at first since they say I am very strong socially.

While this has given me a huge boost in self-confidence, I am aware that this is really just an outer shell and that, when I get closer to people, I often have big problems socially. This may be why I do not have many friends. 

I am currently dating a girl, for over one year now, but since this is a very long distance relationship (she lives in the US, I live in the Netherlands) we have only had three periods where we met face to face. I have managed to get by quite a bit with my more superficial social 'facade' but I am now worried about problems I am encountering, specifically my lack of expressing emotions as well as a problem actually understanding feelings that I experience.

I have massive issues in actually 'looking the part', so to speak. Whenever I have to go back home and leave my girlfriend, I truly feel devastated. However, I rarely cry, even when my girlfriend is often in tears. I really don't want her to think that I am somehow emotionless about the whole ordeal because I am not. She has problems with feeling insecure and I don't want to somehow make her feel even more insecure and wondering if I like her or not. 

I have talked to my girlfriend about this and she is very understanding, but I still would like to address this issue for myself. 

So, Reddit, I am wondering if there are tips and hints about getting more in touch with your emotions and expressing them better. I would like to also understand the emotions I am feeling more. I often don't know if I am feeling 'happy' or 'sad' because it all becomes a confused mess in my head. 

tl;dr: my body often does not express emotions that I am feeling and I want to change this. Are there any tips?

(x-post from r/parenting)","I've been watching the same child since he was 12 weeks old, over 2 years now. He was a great, well behaved baby and he still is well behaved. However, he never has communicated. He doesn't really respond to his name, doesn't say ""hi"" or ""bye"", doesn't follow simple commands like picking up a cup, doesn't answer simple questions like ""would you like juice""? He seems to be in his own little world. They were a little concerned about it until around his second birthday he learned to say his entire alphabet and recognize every letter as well as count to 20 forwards and backwards. They dismissed the fact that he couldn't communicate as ""children learn at different rates"" and since he could say his ABC's and other kid's his age couldn't, he must just excel in that area and lack in communication for now. I realize there is a broad range on the autism spectrum, but I believe he might have some issues, even if they're mild. Like I said, I've kept him 30 hours a week for 2 years now. I care about him. The parents don't believe in traditional medicine and he doesn't go to a pediatrician, or I'm sure it would have been addressed by now.

1073,Just need to vent:  feel like a prisoner in my own home as a SAHM to an autistic preschooler,"As I write this, I haven't showered, and I've spent the last 2 1/2 hours now in varying stages of trying to get my son to take a nap.

He doesn't nap every day now, which is fine; however, he's still wildly unpredictable in terms of whether or not his ""signs of readiness"" for a nap will result in 3 hours of fighting a nap to no avail, conking out almost immediately, or something in between where he puts up a good fight for a few hours and then passes out.  

Of course, when he does nap, it's glorious and I get the precious hour or so to myself that every fiber of my being seems to be screaming out for, and I do my damndest to enjoy it.

Bedtimes and naptimes are, obviously, completely correlated, and it's always a tradeoff.  If we do get him to nap, I can recharge in the afternoon, but he'll stay up so late that any hope of doing anything productive or of quality in the evening is pretty much gone.  

But, the unpredictability of it all, combined with the stress and monotony of the rest of the daily details has pushed me--a self-described calm, composed, and difficult to rattle person--to the point where I don't think I even recognize myself anymore.


When my son started showing signs of autism a bit after age 2, it was terrifying.  When his pediatrician casually told us ""yep, he's probably on the autism spectrum"" a few months later, my heart shattered into a thousand little pieces.  I still have not recovered in the year since his declaration, despite doing all the ""right things"", like getting involved in Early Intervention services, getting a formal diagnosis, starting various therapies, etc..

And even though right now, I'm making the best of being an unemployed post-graduate (i.e. a Stay-At-Home-Mom, but not really by choice), I struggle with how very little of my own life is not dictated by the whims and needs of this mysterious, challenging, and yet desperately loveable little boy.  


I find myself still bitterly clinging to the me that got left behind without me even knowing it.  The me that could (and did) relax easily; the me that felt in control of her life; the me that believed she could be a good parent.

I don't think I'm a bad mom to my son; I'm overall proud of the attention and energy I give him.  But it comes at a price, and I resent it.

It wouldn't be so damned hard if even the smallest little pleasures in life weren't also robbed from me.

I can tolerate not going to fancy restaurants, or going 10-12 hours without a ""break.  I can tolerate my nice things getting ruined, getting pinched and bruised and screamed at.  I can tolerate a lot of the things that come with this.  

But I miss being able to read the paper for 20 minutes while relaxing at a coffee shop.  When I try to emulate something similar, it almost always ends with a screaming preschooler and me processing a whole host of emotions of self-loathing (""why did I even think this might be a good idea?""), embarrassment (""those other patrons probably think I'm a horrible mother""), pity for my son (""he doesn't understand what's going on...it's not his fault he's having a hard time""), regret (""I never should have come here""), resentment (""if my kid was normal things wouldn't be so damn hard""), and fear (""will I EVER get to go back to anything resembling the way things were?"").


I mourn for the person I am no longer.  I miss the me that never yelled, never raised her voice, never lost her temper, let alone basic composure.  I miss the me that felt confident in my ability to handle lifes challenges; to figure out the solutions, and keep plodding along in a forward trajectory.

I know I can't expect my friends or family to understand how I feel...I know my husband doesn't even really get it.  Not that he doesn't feel stressed in his own right, but I do get envious in a total non-rational way about how he gets to leave the house every day and escape the restrictions of caring for our son.  

I feel very mixed feelings about the fact that I'm looking forward to working full time so I can justify paying half my salary to hire someone else to watch my son.  Right or wrong, I think working would be easier than this.  


I'm not looking for anything other than to put out my own thoughts in a space I can hope is without judgment.  I spent the vast majority of my time censoring my inner monologue to my loved ones because I don't want to be ungrateful of the overall blessing that is my son.  I do love him.  And I do love EVERY part of him.  And my life could be so much worse; I could be in a bad marriage (my husband is amazing) or in a bad spot financially (we make ends meet, which is good enough for me!), or in bad health, etc.  

But still...

1075,"Not autistic ""enough""..","My daughter has autism. When she was 18 months she stopped talking to me. She never wanted to be held or touched, she screamed when her senses got overloaded - which was constantly. She got older, and things were ""better"" but hard. She received therapy every single day from 18 months to the age of 5. She was in a day program from age 2-5 where she got 8 hours a day of constant therapy. She went from a child who had to carry around a ""puke bag"" wherever she went because she would get so hysterical she would vomit, to a child who loves to hug her friends when they are sad. She went from a child who we were told would never go to ""regular"" class, to a child who is happily entering 2nd grade at the local elementary school ahead of her peers academically, and while she is called ""excessively shy"".. she manages to interact with her peers and participate in class. 

It makes me happy to hear other people say ""you would never know she has autism"". It makes me angry to hear people say ""Are you sure she is autistic? Because my [insert cousin, neighbor, friend's kid] has autism and they are so much worse than she is"". Then they list all the ways that child is autistic like it is a contest to see who is ""more autistic"". They ask ""Oh, she must have Aspberger's then"" .. no, she does not. She is autistic. And, while Aspberger's is on the spectrum, it isn't what she is. 

My kiddo has come a million light years from where she was, and I thank early intervention for that. But she still struggles every day. The world is black and white, and she doesn't understand that not everything is literal.  She is easily overwhelmed, especially with people. She gets obsessed over things and it is hard to redirect her. 

Why do people feel this need to make me feel like I have to explain my child to them? I try to brush it off and say that early intervention worked really well and we are happy with where she is at, but they still want to argue about it with me.

1078,Looking for some advice.,"Throw away here, but I will try to keep in touch.

I have a sister-in-law whose son is almost four years old and refuses to believe anything is ""wrong"" with him. Without any medical experts involved yet, there is a possibility of autism. For speech he makes sounds to indicate what he means, or uses single syllable words that are either made up or the first syllable of the proper word. (Example: Robots are ""ro"")

He is a very sweet child, and very concerned if anybody gets hurt. But he is also prone to lashing out with objects or his hands if he gets frustrated. I have heard that this is common with autism, but he's also under four.

First question, what signs should I look for in my nephew? The language thing is the only clear indication that something might be going on as far as I can tell. The tantrums are bad, but are they necessarily a symptom of something? He also tends to be a bit obsessive about things.

If there are indications of autism, does anybody have any advice one taking it to my SIL? She definitely has the fierce mama bear thing going on, and has taken him to doctors to see if there is any physical problems. But I don't know how she'd take the suggestion that he has autism or some other issue.

My heart hurts so much for him because these other boys took advantage of him emotionally and sexually. Rumors have been spreading throughout the middle school and elementary school about an incident which happened to him in 5th grade. One boy, who is the one terrorizing my brother, told him that if he took pictures of his genitals and brought them to school then everyone would be his friend. My brother used to be extremely trusting and did not always realize when people were mocking him, but since the incident, he has become paranoid, withdrawn, and overly sensitive to anything that could be perceived as a threat to him. My brother's bully was given a punishment, but since my father intercepted the photos before they could go to the school, it wasnt really the school's jurisdiction. Since entering middle school, the bully has terrorized my brother by making obscene and lewd gestures towards him, spreading false rumors about my brother being a molester, and convincing other children to ignore him in school. My mother is doing everything she can to combat this bully, including taking a substitute teaching job at the school so that she can keep a close eye on everything, since the rest of the teachers have failed to notice this abuse. Do you have any advice for my brother or for my mother?

She only comes to school on Wednesdays (I'm in Australia, it's Wednesday), and she also came to our school camp a few weeks ago, were I spent time during free time with her going on walks around the area.

Being a Wednesday, she was at school today.  It was just lunch 15 minutes ago, so I went to sit with her while she ate for the first half of lunch.

In the second half, I asked if I could take her on a walk to see all my friends (who had also been at camp with her).  They said yes, and asked if I wanted help.  I declined.

After 15 minutes of walking around (and grabbing a weighted toy), she decided that it would be nice to go and visit them.

So I took her.  It was a nice walk, and she enjoyed it.  She even said ""hello"" with prompting (a great achievement for her!) to one person.

She knows who I am, which is great, and I think that now she knows who some others in our school year are.

I also see patterns everywhere, sometimes I feel as if I'm obsessive, and while I have performed well at school its clear to me I'm playing with another 'weapon set' so to speak. I study unconventionally, with any art like task, I approach and find different issues and motifs, mostly for the better but I've missed a lot as well. 

Another thing worth mentioning is something I've felt since I could leave the house myself. I hate the acts of leaving and locking up and making sure everything's 'alright and safe'. This sometimes takes me upwards of 15 mins. Though I think its also because I hate being out of the house. 

And one last thing that kinda gets me to stupidly self diagnose, I can't hear people speak in a loud room or when they whisper, I can hear perfectly, I just find myself not listening carefully as I'm already planning my response before I've heard anything. 

Social stuff is so mechanical for me, I've always assumed that was everyone's experience. I have good solid friends, and I'm valued for volunteering and youth group work, but I'm hiding this hatred of my anxiety mixed with social troubles, What's up with me? Is anything up with me?

1088,X-post for professionals working with autistic clients and students: /r/behaviortherapy.,"First off, I will respectfully ask your pardon for posting across the forums. As a social skills teacher I keep an eye on /r/aspergers, /r/autism, /r/education, /r/Neuropsychology, and /r/Stoicism to glean what insights I can. (There are many.) Thinking that other professionals might be doing the same, I wanted to bring attention to /r/behaviortherapy. 

I have not seen another dedicated reddit for social skills and behavior therapists and teachers to share resources and discuss the specifics of offering services to students and individuals on the spectrum. Unfortunately, /r/behaviortherapy never took off. After meeting a few redditors at some of my start of school trainings, I am thinking that this would be a good time of year to try and give it a jump start.

I have put up a post there to give an example of something we shared in a training. I hope it is helpful and that others working in this field will join in on creating a place for brainstorming and sharing solutions as a group. Thank you, and now back to your regularly scheduled subreddit...

1089,Hi /autism. Starting new job where I have to take care of autistic children - any good advise? ,"Hi /autism

I am starting a new job next week, where I have to help taking care of children diagnosed with infantile autism. I have been working in a regular day care for years, but I don't know how much my experience from that job will help me. I have been reading a lot about the subject, but I am still a bit nervous about what I have gotten my self into! I will of course receive training when I start the job, but I always like to do my own research as well. 

So can anyone give me some pointers on how to behave with these kids? 
Like good ways to solve conflicts, not upsetting them, how to introduce yourself and so on. Also links to good resources on autism would be very much appreciated. 

Edit:

Thanks so much everyone. There are definitely a lot of good advises here. I knew asking reddit would be a good idea, thanks for not letting me down :) My first day on the job is tomorow, so I will update you guys on how it was.

1091,Is my boyfriend autistic?,"Hey guys, I have been with my boyfriend for about 7 - 8 months now and have been struggling to work out why his behaviour seems quite odd at times and how I should go about it.

Firstly let me tell you a bit about my boyfriend, he is a lovely man, 27 doing a phd and is extremely good at what he does (coding, programming and robotics). His intelligence is way way above mine sometimes I feel he is a bit too good for me, although often he seems to prefer his technology to me. Sometimes he will be on his computer coding and I will touch him and he will pretend nothing is happening, like I am not there so I will often go further to try and get a bit of attention, like put my head on his lap or prod his face and kiss him. Still he will often pretend I am not there and continue coding.

I have spoke to him about his behaviour and he says he just feels a bit akward sometimes (even after we have been together for quite a long time, I knew him for 3 years prior to dating him). He never gives me eye contact (or anyone for that matter) or compliments me. I often compliment him about how handsome I find him but he will just ignore it and pretend I havn't said anything at all. If I need to speak to him about how I am feeling I often need to do it by text or facebook in order to give him the chance to say his bit as he seems to need thinking time.

He often has trouble making conversation with anyone unless it is something he knows a lot about like technology otherwise he will just say nothing and again not even initiate that you have even said anything.

When I first started going out with him there was no flirting at all, it was like he was unable to transverse from friendship to a relatioship and didn't understand that it is exactly the same as a friendship but a bit closer and more intimate. Just to get together I had to tell him straight to his face ""I fancy you"" which then led to a friends with benefits type thing because he was to embarrassed to actually be seen holding hands and stuff. I did not want to be friends with benefits, I wanted to be in a proper relationship with took me about another 3 - 4 months to get to from that stage. When I tried to tell him I wanted a proper relationship and not just friends with benefits he covered his face with a pillow and said he was embarrassed to talk about it. Eventually I finally became his girlfriend and felt like I had to secure it over facebook just because otherwise I knew he'd continue to pretend I wasn't there when in public with him. This way he would have less of an excuse. I often need to be very straight forward with him as it is just impossible to pick up hints, like flirting at when trying to get with him as a no go because he wouldn't pick up on it. If I am upset or frustrated I need to tell him straight out because otherwise he won't notice.

 He often gets embarrassed extremely easily, like if we are watching a TV show with an akward scene in it he will cover his face with a pillow and start going 'noooo nooo aaahhhh.' People often notice he gets embarrassed easily and do stuff to embarass him of course he just does his usual pretend its not happening thing.

He also has a fairly childish sense of humour and still really loves his Lego and cartoons which I find quite cute. He can also read his books so quickly and for hours. On our holiday he read through his 600 page book in the time it took me to read half of my 270 page book.

He also says he thinks he might be autistic but refuses to go and find out because he is happy the way he is. I understand that and will not make him but I'm finding it difficult.

So, r/autism, can you help? I love this man so much and want to be closer to him, but am finding it so difficult because there feels like there is a barrier I can't break down in order to get closer to him. I often feel ignored because of his unusual behaviour of pretending it's not happening. I have dyslexia so I have been able to understand that I need to go quite slow with him. But I crave so much to be close like I have been with past previous relationships I just want him to finally be relaxed with me. Is it even possible if he might be autistic? Or will it just take a little longer and he will get there eventually? I don't know if it is unfair for me to feel neglected as I know he struggles but I can't help it? I'm only human, every girls needs a bit of attention.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/yf9i6/is_my_boyfriend_autistic/,59

I'm sick and tired of reading all this shit on those pages, telling people to just ""get motivated"" or ""sack up"" as if it were so fucking easy. 
I'm so done trying to fit in, trying to impress people, because i finally realize nobody wants an unattractive male who can't recognize a single normal aspect of a neurotypical conversation. I can't do ""game"", I can't ""get motivated"" because i don't work like that. I know i'm 18, but please please please do not give me the whole ""you have the rest of your life ahead of you"" lecture. I don't have my whole life ahead of me because truly i've never had one in the first place. Normal people can just go up to anyone and strike up a conversation, while i sit here struggling; trying get the cohones to make eye contact, let alone talk, to somebody i ACTUALLY KNOW. 
I'm a very intelligent person. I'm political active and aware, and an atheist. People already think because i speak intelligently i'm an asshole and bragging about everything that i know, so i already know that i'm never going to win in that department. Why should i have to change myself because some fuckwad thinks i'm a douche? 
I know i'm just starting college but i already know what it's going to be. Its going to be the same shit i went through the past 8 years. Being made fun of, people not liking me, no one giving me the time of day, and being single throughout college. 

No one will ever give me the time of day, no one will ever appreciate me, no one will ever respect me, and no one will want me.

1096,My experience with ASD,"Hello /r/autism. Fair warning: It's long, and it can get a bit corny (sorry!)

I am the big sister of a teen with autism. This teen has had the most rough time in school than anyone I've ever known. He was viciously bullied by kids who were too ignorant to see the potential in him, ignored by aides who were clearly just in it for the money, and then he written off as a ""slow kid"" by his teachers. All in all, elementary school was definitely not fun for him. 

Me and our other brother, we've never seen him as particularly challenged or abnormal. With us, everything was natural, so we just guessed he was physically sick or something. He's the most funny person I know, very smart too of course. He was so close to being on the honour roll, just a couple of points! He's come so far since he was a kid, screaming when there were loud noises, putting a 30 second clip on loop over, and over and over again.

But through his whole life really, the only thing I saw different in this brother of mine was that he was funnier than the other kids.

So this summer, I've had the incredible luck, thanks to him, to work at a local autism centre. We are just a family support group, we don't do therapy or behavioural interventions or anything like that. All we do is plan conferences and activities. This summer, we were given the task, the other students and I, to make a social skills camp from scratch. 

Not a small task. We printed and laminated dozens of visual schedules, we scoured for and bought materials for crafts and sports activities, we researched some ABA techniques and a real smorgasbord of terms and studies. 

When it was finally time to start, we had our strict schedule in hand, thinking we were going to be ready. 

More than once, our visual schedules were just tossed aside, adjusting the activities a bit for every group. 

The teenagers were pretty easy to handle. Of course the group included my brother, and we had the best of times. At the end of camp, he told me I did a really good job and that I was a good sister, and that would have been enough to make me cry. But there's so much more.

We had 3 other groups: 2 of them were younger children, and the other pre teens. 

The pre teen one was pretty much controlled chaos, but the forgiveness they had for each other was simply beautiful. Lots of squabbles, but very few unsolved. Their group dynamic was based on teasing and arguing, so we had to cut in a lot with them. It was very exhausting, but they often understood how they hurt their peers, so it went well all in all. 

The youngest groups were definitely the most cuddly ones. The best way to describe it by comparing them to kittens. They were all talking at the same time and they would not stop with the hugs. Again, they came with their challenges. Understanding that paint makes a mess, staying in the room, not running off. But all of them were so caring. One made a mess with some tie-dye and he said ""Don't worry, I'll pick it up!"" Our slight anger was of course, instantly dissipated.

All of them have made such tremendous progress. From some that barely talked to us to some that wouldn't stop talking, everyone has learned. The parents all told us how they were grateful, but I think we might have been more grateful. I can help my lil' bro now, I can now get through to him when he doesn't understand something. Most of those kids have real conversations and show interest in each other, and the ones who don't now know to look people in the eye when they talk.

Autism was always a part of my life, and clearly since I am the big sister, will always be there. These kids and teens, they were all so intelligent, so talented, and they will go far. 

For their families, it's hard, NO doubt about it. Our journey with my brother was a constant fight uphill with the stupid elementary school that didn't think he had a problem, but treated him like crap because he was different. He turned out great in the end though, so don't give up!

1097,Gaming and Educational Learning Center for the Disabled,"The goal of this project is to help build a Gaming and Educational Learning Center inside of the Grinders Games store location.  It's very tough as I sit here and write this to find the right words to show why this is going to be beneficial, mostly because I'm filled with emotion about this project. - http://www.indiegogo.com/grindersgames?a=488423

By integrating gaming and education, we will provide educational and social opportunities for children with special needs (ADHD, Autism, Aspergers, etc), while also providing support and programs for all children.

Our goal is to have programs that mix gaming and education. We will serve children of all ages and of all needs.

Having a son who has been through every test for ADHD, Aspergers, Autism, etc - I can see first hand how rough it can be to fit in with other kids who may share different interests or see things differently than other kids.  I have also seen the power of games and how they not only help with social development and logical thinking but also how they can help bring kids together who may not have had something in common before.

A center like this, while being only one small piece of the puzzle, can have an enormous impact on a community of kids that want to be involved and accepted. 

In every community, there are youth who sometimes have trouble finding their niche, their circle of friends, etc. We believe that through gaming and education, we can provide a valuable resource to these children. The gaming community is a strong one, and one that helps build social skills, logical thinking, and strategic thinking, all while having fun at the same time!

We need two things to make this dream a success.

Money

Support

Our monetary goal for this project is $22,000 which will provide all the necessary equipment and licenses that we detail below.  We also need SUPPORT to make this project known to as many people as possible. 

A great way to support us, is to share this on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or Email to help get the word out. Encourage YOUR FRIENDS to share this on their networks as well.

We are desperate for a way to get away, as after years cooped up at home with no friends we're getting down in the dumps.

He's sweet but extremely active.  We are either looking for a vacation in which we have activity that he can be supervised and cared for while we do something else nearby like grab a lunch together, or find a camp which takes him while we can relax for a little while, or maybe even a vacation in which they have qualified child care so that we do not get called back in half an hour to come get him.

Obviously, we're simple folk and money is a factor, but we'd like to really try to do this instead of sitting at home alone for our vacation time this year.

1107,I developed an AAC app that helps people with autism and other disabilities communicate. 50 promo codes to give away for iPad/iPhone users.,"My app is called Posco. Posco is an AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) app. I created it for my high school senior year independent study. For the past year, I have worked hard creating Posco for Android, iOS, and recently over the summer, for Windows 8.
Parents of autistic children are most likely already familiar with AAC apps, but for those who are not, AAC apps allow user to touch buttons on the screen, causing the device to speak what was selected. For example, a user could press ""Hello"" and then ""My name is Bobby,"" and the device would speak that out loud using speech synthesis technology.

Developing Posco has been about more than just learning new programming languages and SDKs - a large amount of time has been spent testing Posco with children and teenagers with autism at my school and in my community. The feedback I've received has helped me create an easy to use, powerful app.

How can reddit help? Well, I should get this out of the way: Posco costs $10, but I can give it to 50 people for free. (The leading competitor costs $180). The reason I charge money is simply to save money for college (which I'll be starting in the Fall). Autism Centers and schools have expressed their appreciation for such a low price (compared to the competition), many suggesting I charge more. I've opted not to, though, because I know that there are parents out there who, unlike schools and autism centers, don't have bags of money to throw around.

I don't want you guys to buy it. I have 50 promo codes to give out for iOS (iPhone and iPad). PM me or leave a comment asking for a promo code (and a little explanation of who will be using the app would be nice too) and I'll be more than happy to PM you a promo code or link to APK for android.
Thank you so much!

EDIT 2: TL;DR - developed an AAC app that helps people with speech disabilities communicate. I have 50 promo codes for people who think it could help them or someone they know. PM me or leave a comment and I'll get you one! (Android and iOS available)

He's always been ""fun"" about textures, he's scream when we'd stand him on grass to the point of turning red, he has to touch a surface with his hand to make sure it was real before walking out on it, he hardly spoke and never mimicked us. He has always been a jumper also, he has broken his crib base from jumping too much and a trampoline doesn't nothing to kill the constant desire for deep impact. He hasn't had any formal testing and we don't want to do that til he's able to comprehend words and meanings much better. Right now we are just dealing with the sensory issues as they effect education and communication and working on increasing his verbalization. He's a brilliant happy kid and very very loving. We have our good days and bad, when just about anything overloads him and he kinda of shuts down and wants to cry. Right now our O/T has us cutting all dairy in hopes that this will make a change, I'd love to talk to anyone with direct experience with this treatment, Its talking about it a book called ""what's eating your child?""

I'm 17 now, and will be 18 in 20 days. I'm also starting my first day of fall college classes four days after my birthday. I have a lot of mental problems, such as depression, Generalized anxiety disorder, and Bipolar disorder. 

I've tried and tried and tried to work on my social behavior to become more appealing to women but nothing ever seems to work, i always seem to find the one thing that can mess the whole thing up and take full advantage of it. The constant rejection only makes my depression worse and then i lose what little chutzpah i had to ask a girl out, thus leading to an even worse self-image and thoughts of self-harm. 
I know it sounds ridiculous, cheesy, whatever. But sometimes (AKA most of the time) i feel like i need someone because i have absolutely no confidence in my ability to be alone, and i'm more of an introvert. (ISFJ according to Myers-Briggs II). 

Do you guys have any advice for someone who can't get a date to save their life? I appreciate it.

1118,Hyper-empathic - having trouble coping with SO's depression,"I scoured /r/depression and found some good information on dealing with a depressed spouse, but I think I'm in a slightly different situation...

My SO lost his job back in March. He's always had some emotional turbulence (his father was emotionally abusive, and then died of cancer when my SO was only 11 - so lotsa guilt/anger there) but it's pretty natural, considering, and he manages it pretty well for the most part. But months of prolonged unemployment have made his moods so much more volatile and dark - and frequent. Each rejection letter or reminder that he doesn't have a job just makes things worse, and as millions are finding out in this economy, long-term unemployment can take a severe and lasting toll on even the most emotionally robust.

He's told me repeatedly that I'm one of the only things keeping him sane, that he'd be lost without my support, etc. Which feels great, except as the weeks drag on, I feel more and more like I'm failing as he slips further into depression. He's on an antidepressant right now but it, too, seems to be less and less effective.

All fairly run-of-the-mill in this recession (sadly), but here's where things get sticky: as an autistic, I feel *myself* being pushed closer and closer to the brink of overload. I'm fairly high-functioning and since being officially diagnosed, now I know what the heck is going on with my own mind and I can recognize and deal with my own reactions to things around me. But with me, personally, I've found one of the number one manifestations of my autism is a hyper-empathy. If someone around me is happy, I'm delirious for/with them. Similarly, if someone around me is anxious, I pull my hair out - even if the cause of the anxiety has nothing to do with me. I just seem to pick up on other people's wavelengths - it's a huge reason why I almost only ever watch comedies and action movies and have to be in the most exaggeratedly tranquil settings to watch/read anything even remotely depressing or terrifying - it's like I feel everything everyone else feels, but with the volume at 11.

Does anyone have *any* advice for how to deal with this? I've been trying things that calm myself down (reading calming things, keeping a positive outlook, I work out daily, etc), but it's getting to the point where I'm afraid I myself might have a meltdown if something doesn't give soon with his depression. I love him fiercely and want to do everything I can for him, and he's said he recognizes that, but as we all know, depression is not just something you can turn off like a light switch and I feel like things are coming to a head. Sorry this is so long, I just haven't really spoken with anyone about this and I guess it all kinda came pouring out.

**TL;DR: Dealing with a depressed SO is hard regardless, but how can I avoid a meltdown when everything I feel is intensified by my autism?**",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/xgx94/hyperempathic_having_trouble_coping_with_sos/,772

1120,Just lost a job after working there for two days.,"I have been a salesperson for a long time. At my previous job, people were mostly understanding about my lack of social skills. I used to drink to try to get along with everybody. Every year, several times a year, two or three or maybe four customers would complain about me, and they'd reassign the account. At first it was a very laid back company, and I got along fine. Recently, they were purchased by another company, which was very stiff and formal. They hired new managers, and these managers were not happy with the customer complaints. I quit with a severance, and after several months, found a job at another company. This company was extremely laid back, but they also were inclined to cheat customers, so I started looking for another job. I found it, with a company that seemed very relaxed. However, I found out on the first day that they weren't. I had three managers, and they were all pulling me in different directions. They were all very serious, and I don't know how to do serious. I really don't. I can't be formal and ""professional"", as in, acting like a banker, no matter how I try. So after two days, I was asked to leave. I had quit my previous job, and I don't think I can collect unemployment because I was only there for two days. 

My previous company (the first one) put up with me happily, because I always made my quotas and four times won their highest award. The second company had no problem with me; they even asked me to do a seminar for customers. But in that job I worked out of my home and didn't have to handle office politics. I have Asberger's, which is weird for a salesperson, but I can handle being somewhat normal for short bursts. I am so depressed right now because I do fail so badly at formality and propriety. I have pissed off more than one new coworker in my life by saying something stupid. I usually get along with them eventually, but it often doesn't go well in the beginning. How do I learn social skills? How do I learn how to act around ""normal"" people? I'd like to someday go into medicine but I'm afraid I'd get fired for saying the wrong thing to a patient!

1123,Autistic girl video inspired me to ask you about something I've struggled with my whole life: massive over abundance of sensory input,"Hi /r/autism. I'm a guy in my 30s and I've been struggling with a problem my whole life. I hope I don't offend anyone with this post, but this path I'm following is the biggest source of hope I've had in a while to figure this out about myself. 

I never would have thought about autism until I watched the video about the severely autistic girl who was communicating through the computer, and she said something about how she is constantly overwhelmed by all of her senses and how she has a hard time looking at people's faces because it's like taking ten thousand pictures. 

All of my life I've struggled with this characteristic. I've always referred to it as trying to drink from a raging river, because a firehouse is too tame a comparison. My senses don't seem to have a filter the way other people's do, I don't seem to have a ""background"" everything is always ""on""; I am always aware of the feel of everything I'm touching like clothing etc, I know my own heartbeat and can hear it constantly thumping, every conversation and sound around me is competing for my attention, I have a very complex sense of taste (which is awesome at least) and my sense of smell is ridiculous (like I found out one day that it is not normal to know who is pooping in the restroom with you at the office by the smell and women don't like it that you know when you know without being told that they're menstruating). I have very vivid sight and often see things that others don't, or long before they do (like a car coming to do something stupid, or some shady guys acting shady).  I got teary the first time I watched Limitless because it seemed like someone understood what I go through (I even get those horrible bouts of blackouts with missing time if I don't eat and keep up with sleep) even though it was portrayed positively in that movie. Sadly, I have such a monster rush of information I can't do most of the tricks with it that he can. 

Secondly, when I am conversing with people I get this massive amount of micro expressions in every second. I got really interested in Paul Ekman's work some years back (the guy Lie To Me is based on) because I was what he referred to as ""a natural."" Reading faces and body language is often overwhelming, and my biggest problem in relationships is making judgements about which of the hundreds of different emotions every second are the most important (I have learned that the ""last one"" before neutral is usually the more ""real"" one, but I still struggle a lot). I am incredibly empathic, often to a debilitating degree. 

It often takes an immense amount of concentration for me just to filter out the useless information I am flooded with, whereas it seems for most people that they struggle to pick up on the most obvious (to me) of details of their surroundings. It's utterly exhausting. And on top of that, at least once or twice a day when I let my guard down, I'll look at someone or someones and it's like my brain downloads this massive dump of perfectly captured information about the situation. Like ten thousand times more detailed and vivid than usually just glancing around. But it's not all sensory (like although I can picture it perfectly, I couldn't describe people's clothing) it's more like a complete snapshot of the universe, this massive sensory and empathic input, like I could sit and describe exactly how this person is. Sometimes it feels so intense I feel like I *am* that person for a few seconds after, like the only thing separating me from them is this thin veneer of our brains. The memory and effects lasts for hours and is super distracting. 

I also have a crazy gift for remembering the faces and body language of everyone I meet, and am frustrated often that I recognize someone but can't place where (and it's not imaginary, there's been a bunch of times we figured out something random like we were both at the same music festival or something) but this one is more of a useful superpower but I thought it was worth mentioning. 

I've read about autism and I don't seem to have any other characteristics, but I don't know anymore. I am successful and happy, I am very gifted socially, I can relate to people (too much sometimes), I don't have trouble picking out focal clues, etc. That's why I'm coming to you because like I said this is the first time I've had hope in years.

Because I'll be honest, when I heard that girl talking about those problems, I got teary-eyed. I've always wished there was some way I could tone it down when I wanted to, like a pill or a technique, because I've been completely on my own about this my whole life. Alcohol is the only thing that helps, but it gives me terrible tunnel ""vision"" and I generally find it unpleasant to be drunk. (The ironic possibility that this tunnel vision is more like ""normal"" people has not been lost on me.)

Sorry that this is long and rambley, I just don't know what to talk about. I want to ask questions, but I don't even know where to start. I guess, does this sound like something like autism, and does anyone have any suggestions for what I can do? Like more reading, resources, or drugs to help, or something. Anything. I've mentioned this to doctors during my life and they always just give me ADD drugs which do nothing for me. I don't want to say I'm desperate because I've taught myself to deal with this over my life, but I think if I found something that would help give me relief from this constant assault, I probably wouldn't be able to stop sobbing for days.

I always thought my 'anti-social' behavior came from excessive gaming (or this may of just made it worse).  

If I am out I will usually starve myself because I don't want to interact with shop owners, I want to, but something is holding me back.

I remember when I was young I had a huge box of toy cars and I would always line them up neatly, again another symptom for autism.

I have many friends which I have made in real life that I only talk to on Skype.  They have always asked for me to come out with them to go to town or the park but I am always compelled to say 'No, I can't'.  

Another symptom that I have is 'self harming' but only to my lips I usually do this out of pure nervousness or just randomly.  I will continue to pick my lip until it bleeds.

I always think to myself when in college, high-school and primary that I just don't 'fit in' with the rest of the students, I always act weird, quiet or just plain annoying.  Yet I still feel the same from primary to college.

There are many more symptoms but I'll leave it at that.  Overall I am sort of happy, as it explains why I have acted this way.  On the other hand I am worried for my future, knowing that autism isn't really 'curable' many autistic adults have been saying life is hell for us.

1130,Today my 4 year old Autistic son unlocked the front door and got about several blocks from the house. Can anyone recommend a tracking system?,"We have recently moved to a new home and no longer have a fenced front yard. In this house he also figured out how to unlock the deadbolt on the front door. There is a park about 12 blocks away that we have walked to a few times.

  Today while I was at work and his mom was getting clothes out of the dryer he booked it out the door. She was only gone a minute. Grabbed the clothes out of the dryer in the garage and came back in. She looked for him and couldn't find him anywhere. That is when she realized the front door was wide open. He had managed to get a little more than 3 blocks from the house. He had already crossed several busy streets that were luckily empty at that moment. Being the little guy he is he didn't pause before running into the street. He never slowed down, he just kept running. It took another 2 blocks before she was able to catch him. 

Until this incident we have been able to successfully keep him confined to our yard even if he managed to get outside. It was still rare. At this new house it is a constant event that he is trying to get out. I put slide locks up high on the doors. (landlords might be a bit pissed, but oh well)... Still we are considering what else we could do in case he makes it out. So anyone have a tracking system or some such thing that they'd recommend?

She had looked this up: http://www.mypreciouskid.com/loc8tor-tracking-device.html

I was leaning toward GPS myself, but would prefer not having a monthly fee... but it might be worth it. 

Another consideration is size. A bulky box that must be attached to him at all times might not work... a bracelet would be great. Perhaps even something that can clip to his shoes...

I don't know, I'm in need of advice.

1131,"I have agreed to care for my autistic nephew, whilst his parents are at work, but I need help understanding him.","My nephew is 3, he doesn't talk at all and I am never sure how much of what I am saying he understands. Because he doesn't talk he just screeches when he wants something and if you don't get what he means right away he gets more and more frustrated.  

The problem I am having is with getting him to communicate properly and with his behaviour. My sister uses autism as an excuse for him but I am not convinced.

If you dare speak the word NO around him, even if it isn't to him just in his presence, he screams the place down. My sister say's this is because of his autism, I think he is just being naughty. How can you tell?

Also I read a lot about people with autism being helped by a gluten free diet. Is this true? Could it help my nephew?

He's behaviour really isn't expectable he often hits me, if I ignore him he will scratch me and so it escalates. My parents won't go out with him because they are embarrassed by his screaming. I don't want that to happen. I love my nephew and I want to help my sister out. I just wish I could communicate with him better.

1132,[PDD-NOS] Need advice on love,"I have a problem.

I have recently fallen in love with my best friend. She's smart, cute, and really sweet, and we've been able to get along for a long time (5 years). It's my first time falling in love, and I'm 17 years old.

However, as you probably already guessed from the title and the fact that I'm posting this in /autism, I have PDD-NOS. As a result, I freak out with everything that happens a first time, whether it's a pleasant thing or not.

So now, I've fallen in love. I've already been on a few dates with her, but I can't get myself to make a move. I'm not afraid of a rejection; life is full of disappointments and sad moments, and I'm an optimistic person. Plus, I see love as an emotion. So if she rejects me, I just turn the emotion off.

Due to my PDD-NOS, I'm afraid of touches. Not if she touches me; I like that. She's already done it before, jokingly (and yes, I'm sure of that. I was acting ""sad"", exaggerated of course, and she ""counseled"" me).  But I am afraid of touching her. That's why I just can't make my move.

There are also several questions bugging me. 
*She hangs out a lot in the school cantine during the breaks, whereas I hang out in the school library due to the computers there (I plan on studying IT after high school so I'm practicing as much as I can). The cantine has a lot of unknown people, and of course her friends, who are not mine. Would I have to start hanging out in the cantine? 
*What if we break up? She's my best friend - I already have so little friends that I can't afford losing one.
*I already have so little free time. Would I lose the last bit of free time I have if I'd manage to start something with her (I don't consider hanging out with people free time as it's a planned action, and I consider free time to be a period with little to no planning).
*If I manage to start something with her, would she do it because she has actual feelings for me, or because she pities me due to my, well, disabilities/problems/challenges (whatever you wanna call it :P)?

Advice from people with experience would be greatly appreciated. Please, only give me advice and no pep talking. I know that sounds rude, but for some reason pep talks are the only things that can make me feel down, and I don't really like feeling down :P.

1133,"Random Drabble/Story (TW: ""r"" word).  Also, I need help (the bold bit details my question).","“Retard!”

Just because I do not react does not mean that I did not hear.
I know that people think I’m different.  I do not understand why.

What did I ever do wrong?  I am just being me.  But apparently, me is not who I should be.   I should be like everyone else.

Look in my eyes.  Stop flapping.  Stop making that noise.  You are being silly.
No sir, you are being silly.  I cannot help myself.  Well I can, but I will get overwhelmed.  Quickly.
Fine.  I will stop.

No.  No.  Cannot understand.  Too much.  Bright, bright, bright light.  Close my eyes, rock back and forth, get out of here.

“STOP ROCKING.”

Rock forward, away from the noise.  Rock backward, away from the light.

“STOP IT.”

Rock forward, away from the touch of those who are trying to “help”.  Rock backward, away from all of the smells.

“BE NORMAL.”

Normal, what is normal?  To me, the overpowering senses that attack my brain are normal.  Would you call that normal?  This is how I live.  I am being normal.  I use 

rocking

flapping

bouncing

rubbing my fingers

quacking

screeching

fiddling

fidgeting

so that I can act “normal”. 

So that I can talk to you.  So that I can tell you that something is not right.

It is my way

of screaming “SHUT THE FUCK UP!!”

of showing my excitement.

of focusing myself.

of communication.

I am sorry that you do not understand what I am saying.  But should that mean that I have to stop?

So when I screech, because you call me stupid, because you call me slow, I am not agreeing.  I am telling you that I am a person.  That I understand.  That I am here.

I know what will happen.  Do you think I really have that bad of a memory?  Because I do not.  I can hear you.  

I watch it 

over and

over and

over and

over again because I know what will happen.  Because I know what to expect.  I like knowing what will happen.

They say I have “restricted interests”.  I say, why try something new, when I like what I am already doing?

“Change is good sometimes.”

I do not like change.  Change is stupid.

Had periods of calm after distraction techniques and play were used, but later in the afternoon said person reached a point where no matter what techniques we used, how we spoke, what we tried, or how much space was given just couldn't calm down.

1141,Living with Autism,"My name is Nicholas. I was born July 2nd, 1995. I like video games, I enjoy reading,
I worry about peak oil and the economy. Growing up, I played pokemon, and learned to read from an
early age. I enjoy long walks on the beach. I once wrote an article for my mother about men’s pocky. I
pick water types as my starters. I play with items off. I think pink is a manly color. I am a bronie. I am a
democrat. I am aware of all internet traditions. I make Chuck Norris jokes.
 
I am an autistic, and I am just like you.
 
I was diagnosed with Autism, Asperger’s Syndrome to be specific, when I was in the third grade. I don’t
remember exactly how I reacted to learning I was an autistic. I do know that I never made a big deal of
it, and found it all very silly. A vest for my fidgeting? Spending time with a lady with speech cards? I was
however glad to get out of the classrooms, and into special classes, until I learned what a living hell they
were later on.
 
But I’m getting ahead of myself, perhaps from a lack of a real point to start from. How does one define
living with autism? I can’t honestly say how different I would be if I wasn’t an autistic. All I know is that
one day I was defined as having Asperger’s Syndrome. A high functioning autistic, but still, it was yet
another brand. Not that I minded, I preferred being an outsider.
 
In fact, that has been the single hardest problem with me. As much as I try to be friendly with everyone
I meet, it is so hard to accept their viewpoints. “I am right, how can they believe such nonsense?” As
a result, I always tended to prefer adults, they knew what was up, and they didn’t bully. It was just so
frustrating being in such slow classes, dealing with such…well, at the time I considered most of my peers
to be utter morons. Obviously today I know that’s not true, but I was a kid.
 
I think I may have seen my diagnosis as a blessing under that logic. Finally, they would see I wasn’t part
of the herd of children and that I deserved respect! I have always wanted respect from adults more
than respect from children my age – which as a result made me grow up as a loner. I preferred going on
forums, playing an online game, or talking to my mom rather than suffer the idiocy of what my peers
enjoyed.
 
As an autistic, the single hardest thing to do is to understand. Understanding why your peers like what
they like, understanding that you are sometimes wrong, and understanding that school is important. A
wise man once said “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.” If you are an autistic,
you will probably find it absurdly difficult to understand why you have to do things. And if you are the
parent of an autistic, I’m sure you have torn your hair out over their dismissal attitudes and refusal to
do things they do not understand are important. As hard as it sounds to believe, I really didn’t believe
chores, school work, etc were important, simply because I did not understand why they were important.
 
Imagine it this way. A man comes up to you, and tells you to punch him in the face. When you ask him
why, he gives an explanation in a language you do not understand. That is what it is like to be autistic
and being told to do something you do not find important. Even I don’t really know how to handle this
 
problem, but the important thing is keep working at it. Eventually, you or your children will understand.
Perhaps you/they won’t understand why, but they will eventually understand that it is important, and
that will go a long way towards them complying.
 
Onto the next subject – bullying. Autistics are bullied. Especially in the lower grades. Most children
simply do not understand autistic children and will act accordingly. People are afraid of the unknown.
If you are an autistic child, it sucks, but you can’t avoid it. But please, do not let it keep you from trying
to make friends. I made that mistake, and there is a very noticeable void in my life caused by my lack of
relationships. Thankfully, it eventually ends, and you will get out of school one day. But just know, no
matter what you do, you will be bullied.
 
You cannot avoid this, and I beg of you, parents, not to put your children in a “special” program to try
and protect your autistic child if they are high functioning. They do not work. Autistics need to learn via
trial by fire how to deal with their peers, not how to deal with other autistics, which is actually harder in
many cases due to the even larger language gap. Plus, there is one large reason why I beg, not ask, but
beg you keep your children out of special programs – they are hell. The politicians, the councilors, they
will all try to convince you otherwise, but they are either misguided or lying to you.
 
Perhaps there are genuinely good programs for the autistic at your local school. It is possible, but highly
unlikely. I have been in quite a few such programs, including the BRIDGE program, which was supposed
to be among the best in the entire nation. By the middle of my first year there I was literally begging my
father to please make them put me back in the regular classes. “Special” programs are understaffed,
overstuffed, underbudgeted, and assigned teachers who are given insufficient training except on how
to restrain children. That was literally the only thing I ever saw them get right. Don’t take this the
wrong way – most teachers who are a part of such programs do care, but the reality is they are just
undertrained and understaffed.
 
Even if your child is a low functioning autistic, keep them out of public school programs. Unless it is
absolutely your last option, pull as many strings as you have to in order to get them into a private,
specialized school that has the resources required to properly taking care of your child. They will thank
you later. I hate to be so passionate about this, and I normally would say “do the research,” but I assure
you that placing your child in a special care program is among the worst possible options you have. If
it is an aid program designed to supplement normal classes, those actually work and are worth looking
into, but if they involve your child being placed into special classes and given a special routine, just stay
away.
 
Instead, try to get your child tools and accommodations to aid them. Typing accommodations, reading
accommodations, calculator accommodations, whatever it takes. Just, unless it is literally and absolutely
your last resort, do not put them into a special program. They are hell. I say this from experience.
 
Onto the next subject, autistics, don’t feel ashamed. Don’t feel alone. You are you, you are no less
important than anyone else, and never let anyone tell you otherwise. It will be hard. You will not
understand many things, and you will hear rumors and whispers behind your back from peers who
cannot understand. You may even be alone, and your parents might even give up on you. I was
 
fortunate enough to receive a lot of mental support, but it is a very real possibility to be alone in this.
 
It will probably get dark in your life. You will be confused. You may even think you are worthless. You
will feel lost, and that is ok. It is ok to feel lost and confused. But you aren’t worthless. No matter how
hard it can be to think otherwise, don’t give up. Find things you enjoy, and keep working at them. You
will eventually get good at them. It might take a short period of time. It might take years. But never give
up.
 
Finally, the last thing you need to know, growing up with or raising a kid with autism, is that it does
not make you different. Yes, it changes how you think, but you are still human. This is the single most
important thing to remember about autism – it does not make you more or less of a person.
 
In closing, no matter how bad things may get, never give up hope, never stop trying. Please, never
give up. There are people who care. There are people who are worth living for. For parents, never stop
trusting in your child. They are beautiful in their own right; you just have to learn to love them. And if
you’re reading this, trying to understand the portrait of an autistic, please don’t consider us freaks, or
outcasts. Don’t be afraid to meet us. Don’t be afraid to step to our aid. We are just like you. We live like
you, love like you, and laugh like you.
 
We are human too.

1150,"""Empirical evidence shows that a diversity of phenotypes – spanning a continuum from adaptive to pathological – can be transmitted nongenetically. [This] complicates our understanding of evolutionary responses to environmental change."" (2011)","The following information may explain why autism is so heterogeneous.  It seems that there's a great deal of internal confusion about the extent to which this condition can be classified as pathological.  If humans have evolved to adaptively respond to certain environmental triggers that only ever existed in small amounts (e.g. exposure to novel toxins) this might help explain why Kanner believed that ""a touch of autism"" was necessary for genius.  Our most recent changes to the biosphere may be overstimulating epigenetic mechanisms meant to produce a small minority of ""odd"" (by the majority's definition) cognitive phenotypes that are helpful to have around *in small numbers*.

---

This first paper outlines some of the most recent work in [transgenerational epigenetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenerational_epigenetics).  Apparently the scientific community found this stuff controversial a few years ago because it didn't fit nicely into the existing dogma (i.e. all traits are based on either pure genetic determinism or pure environment):

[The implications of nongenetic inheritance for evolution in changing environments](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00213.x/full) (2011)

&gt; Nongenetic inheritance is a potentially important but poorly understood factor in population responses to rapid environmental change. Accumulating evidence indicates that nongenetic inheritance influences a diverse array of traits in all organisms and can allow for the transmission of environmentally induced phenotypic changes (‘acquired traits’), as well as spontaneously arising and highly mutable variants. We review models of adaptation to changing environments under the assumption of a broadened model of inheritance that incorporates nongenetic mechanisms of transmission, and survey relevant empirical examples. Theory suggests that nongenetic inheritance can increase the rate of both phenotypic and genetic change and, in some cases, alter the direction of change. **Empirical evidence shows that a diversity of phenotypes – spanning a continuum from adaptive to pathological – can be transmitted nongenetically.** The presence of nongenetic inheritance therefore complicates our understanding of evolutionary responses to environmental change. We outline a research program encompassing experimental studies that test for transgenerational effects of a range of environmental factors, followed by theoretical and empirical studies on the population-level consequences of such effects.

Epigenetics can and does affect evolution in unanticipated ways.  We know this now:

[The Role of Epigenetics in Evolution: The Extended Synthesis](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/gri/2012/286164/) (2012)

&gt; DNA methylation, the most studied molecular epigenetic mechanism, is active in DNA imprinting, X-inactivation, restructuring the genome in response to polyploidy caused by hybridization, silencing transposable elements, and in response to environmental stressors. DNA methylation is a source of interindividual phenotypic variation and has been shown to cause phenotypic variation in flower shape and fruit pigmentation, mouse tail shape, adult body size and coat color, and numerous traits differentiating queen and worker honeybees.

Recent adaptations in humans, including our social cognition, may be most susceptible to epigenetic dysregulation:

[Epigenetic Principles of Evolution - Nelson R. Cabej](http://books.google.com/books?id=j_LhVpSU8gQC&amp;pg=PA628#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) (2011)

&gt; An atavism in humans is the sudden appearance of the “werewolf syndrome” (congenital generalized hypertrichosis, characterized by a very intense hair growth all over the human body). It is assumed that the developmental pathway for hair coverage was silenced after humans diverged from our primate ancestors, but occasionally it is reactivated to produce the atavism.

---

Atavism is a touchy topic for evolutionary biologists, especially when they're studying humans.  This may be because we (i.e. all people, including scientists) tend to assume that there is an ideal human phenotype that we're all evolving towards.  This is a ridiculous notion, especially in light of how important our species' cognitive diversity has turned out to be.  Different people, even siblings, think **very** differently from one another (in [real, tangible, measurable ways](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/)) and heterogeneity probably trumps homogeneity in the long run, as it tends to make a group more responsive to change:

&gt; It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.

*-- Charles Darwin*

---

Autism may be a form of adaptive atavism, also known as ""[genetic accommodation](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/311/5761/650.short).""  Human brains have shrunk significantly (currently ~1200 cc) since the agricultural revolution, and this may be the result of relaxed selective pressures on individual intelligence.  However the *max* skull size has still increased significantly in modern humans.  For example, Lord Byron's head (~2200 cc) was bigger than that of an average Cro Magnon (~1600 cc, which is much greater than the modern human average), and his daughter [wrote the first computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#First_computer_program).  Autistic people tend to have significantly larger brains.  It's possible that certain evolved mechanisms that regulate the amount of cognitive diversity in our species have been affected (in some cases maladaptively) by recent environmental changes.

**[Hominins and the Emergence of the Modern Human Brain](http://www.scribd.com/doc/79970775/) (2012)**

&gt; Autism...is referenced in studies of fossil hominin brain structure and function, either as an analogy for developmental differences between closely related species or as a potentially atavistic indication of actual primitive phenotypes. For example, an autistic child lacking language created naturalistic artwork much like that from the Upper Paleolithic, on the basis of which it was suggested that [fully anatomically modern humans] could have also lacked fully modern cognition.

---

The next part may seem a bit offensive at first, but there is already good evidence that the behavior of modern human societies resembles (more than superficially) that of eusocial colonial insects ([especially ants](http://news.discovery.com/human/humans-ant-colonies-120502.html)):

**[The Social Conquest of Earth - EO Wilson](http://www.scribd.com/doc/94960128/The-Social-Conquest-of-Earth-Wilson-Edward-O#page=31) (2012)**

&gt; Even by strictly technical definition as applied to animals, Homo sapiens is what biologists call “eusocial,” meaning group members containing multiple generations and prone to perform altruistic acts as part of their division of labor. In this respect, they are technically comparable to ants, termites, and other eusocial insects. **But let me add immediately: there are major differences between humans and the insects even aside from our unique possession of culture, language, and high intelligence.**

*[EO Wilson](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.O._Wilson) holds the posts of Professor Emeritus and Honorary Curator in Entomology, Harvard University, and a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.  He was awarded the National Medal of Science (1977), and the Crafoord Prize (1990), which recognizes research in scientific fields not eligible for the Nobel Prize.*

Some very recent work with eusocial organisms has produced direct evidence of adaptive atavism in other eusocial organisms:

[Science Magazine Podcast - Transcript](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2012/01/05/335.6064.112-b.DC1/SciencePodcast_120106.pdf) (January 2012)

* *Host – Kerry Klein:*

&gt; Rare anomalous traits like snake fingers and bird teeth are certainly considered to be weird and unexpected—but a team of scientists led by Ehab Abouheif of McGill University has unlocked a pattern that explains some anomalies as the re-emergence of ancient ancestral traits...

* *Interviewee – Ehab Abouheif:*

&gt; What we found, essentially, is something very general. Going back to Darwin’s time, and even before and after Darwin, phenotypes that get induced in populations that reflect these kind of ancestral traits – they’re usually called atavisms – but we see them being induced in populations all over the place. And previously, evolutionary biologists had treated them as sort of the Barnum &amp; Bailey of evolution, or some kind of slips of a developmental system. And what we’re showing here is that no, if you were to look at the tree and see that supersoldiers are popping up all over the place independently, we’d have thought okay, they evolved de novo – they evolved, basically, the supersoldier caste independently several times – but the fact that we can induce it in species that don’t have it all over the tree reflects some deep underlying potential that goes back to the ancestor. So the ancestor must have had this trait. It lost the expression of the trait, but retained this genetic potential.

1157,"My brother stims but it's getting out of hand at this p oint, what to do?","As the title explains, my brother (half brother, my mother re-married) is stimming and it's starting to get out of control. Here's some back story:

He's 13 at the moment and for the majority of the time he has displayed stims (hand flapping, some noises, etc.) but nothing that would create cause for concern. It was so negligible that I didn't think about, chalking it up to him expressing himself. Lately, though, he has taken up the stimming habit of dragging his feet against things. This includes the foor, carpets and rugs, stairs, walls, etc. Now I've only recently done research on what stimming is and my personal conclusion to this is to let him do it, since this allows him to cope with an overly-stressful environment. When he started his stimming habit of dragging his feet, it was nothing to be concerned about as he would drag his feet across the floor twice or thrice and that would be the end of it.

About a week or two ago he began displaying excess amounts of stimming. He would do it over and over to the point where he would not listen if we asked him to do something. For whatever reason, he would get upset and following the stimming, begin to bang on the walls, floor, whatever he could get his hands on and near (myself included). 

I'm currently at home with my step father, my brother, sister (half as well with autism too), and our stay-at-home helper, she's been with us for a while. Just not, not an hour ago, we were all outside by our above-ground pool and when it came to head back inside, he didn't want to and proceeded to make a scene by dragging his foot across the pavement area and the dirt right by it. My step father and I had to drag him back inside to clean up as the stimming made him very dirty, to which he responded very violently with hitting us, attempting to force himself back outside. This continued for the next half hour, with him trying to force has way outside and pulling a tantrum when we made him stay inside.

He's calmed down now but I'm afraid that this is only getting worse. Like I mentioned before, I understand that when a child with autism stims, it's best to let them do it and eventually, with time, they'll grow out of the stimming. My only problem now is that he is very violent and aggressive with this stimming and so when it comes time when he can't be outside or can't stim (he recently punched a hole in the wall after getting angry a few days ago) we can't just let him do it, even though it goes against my better judgment. 

This post came out really messy since I'm still recovering from the trouble he just caused, but I wanted to know if there are any parents/siblings of children or teens with autism who very aggressively stim as well as how you have/are dealing with it and whether it is working or not? If anyone has any kind of experience with the aggressive foot-dragging that I've described, that would be so much help! Thank you again!

EDIT:

Thank you to everyone who has commented and shared! I haven't had the time to comment back to everyone but I've been reading up on your posts and they've been helpful. The thing I'm taking away from this is that puberty is causing the sudden increase in stimming behavior and that I'm going to try and work him into more productive ways to dealing with the excess energy/need to stim. My mom enrolled my brother and sister into a summer program at a gym for children/teen with autism, they give them physical exercises and let them run around to vent off their extra energy. She's taking them tomorrow morning so I feel like this'll be good for both him and my sister. 

Once again, I really appreciate all of the help! I don't normally ask around for issues dealing with my brother and sister just because so few of my friends/family know how to deal with it.

1158,Does my daughter fall under Autistic spectrum?,"Hello All,

My daughter is 26 months old. Amazing kid , very active, smiling, throwing things around but does not talk. We started getting a little worried after her second birthday. So, we took her to our pediatrician who did an initial analysis and said she might have PDD. I have a follow up appointment for the coming week with a specialist. But i am anxious. I also want to be prepared for next sessions and what is coming my way. Please help me understand this. Also, please note that i am in India where the awareness for Autism is not very prevalent. I myself started to learn about Autistic spectrum only after the session for my daughter.

Here are her general behaviour:

1)  Walking    - Yes

2)  Running    - Yes

3)  Climbing Stairs  - Yes

4)  Climbing Down Stairs  - Yes

5)  Eye Contact  - Yes

6)  Pointing with finger - No

7)  Words   - Very few (about 5 to 10)

8)  Sensitive to Voice - No

9)  Plays Peek A Boo - Yes

10) Imitating Voices - Yes

11) Pays attention  - No.


However i was not able to understand a few questions the doctor asked.

1) Repetitive Behavior 

     What kind of behavior is repetitive. She likes to play in water for hours. Does this count?



2) Communication.

      She understands when we say 'No',when we say we are going out or time far bath. Is this a good enough measure?



3) Playing with toys properly.
       What does this mean? How do i define measure this properly? 



4) Staring at nothing.

        She does stare out the window while driving or while i am holding her in Balcony. Not sure if this is what the doctor looking for.

1163,I just want to write down some of my own experiences with a mild form of autism as a 14 year old male.,"First of all I don't know if this is posted at the right place and
want to tell everyone that my English isn't that good. I'm a 14 year old Dutch boy so that explains most of it.

We (parents and I) found out about my autism when I was like 7 or 8 years old. I didn't know what it was and didn't really care about it. It wasn't a big problem since it wasn't a severe form of autism. Of course I was a bit weird sometimes, but still had some friends who I used to play with. Well, skip ahead some years and I've lost contact with most of them and had moved to another city 2.5 hours away. This happened 1 year ago. So, this is the part where I find out it's pretty hard having autism. No school wanted me to go there, I was at home for 2 months or something. I ended up at a school specialized in autistic children.

I soon found out it was a horibble idea to go to that school. The children had worser forms of autism then I had so I didn't really make frany iends there (with worser I mean a 16 year old fat boy in my class bringing stuffed animals to school). 

Talking to ''normal'' people was hard to. I knew what I had to do and what I didn't, but it kept happening. When someone I didn't really know that well aproached me I always thought in myself things like: common, don't fuck this up, just act normal. But EVERY time someone started talking to me I said something stupid or didn't react like a ''normal'' person would. 1 Second after I had responded I knew I had fucked it up and said something stupid. That's the worst part about having a mild form of autism. You know there's something wrong with you, you know what's wrong with you and you know what to do. You even want to change, but you just can't. Every time I did something stupid I would know I did it wrong. Giving myself so many situations I remember every day where I screwed something up. Making me pissed off and giving me less hope every day.

Because I don't have any friends in my new city I spend most of the time on my pc, playing games or doing photoshopping. Only times I get some real contact with people is at football practice and games and one weekend in like 4 months when I visit my old town to see some of my old (good) friends.

Of course I could tell alot more, but I can't think of any and I don't even know if you people are interrested. I just wanted to write some things down (which also helped myself a little bit).

So, has anyone ever been in the same situation as me and how did you solve this?

He does not do this when it's cold. 

  Horribly judgemental woman I know flat out said it was ""neglect""  and said in horror ""you let a mentally disturbed child outside naked in the rain where when paedophiles can see him"" and I  ""need to be careful in case you get reported to social services"" when I told her about it.  She also objected to the fact that I thought it was a good thing and I told her ""there is something beautiful about having that level of freedom and that he does not care about what other people think"" 

Firstly when we moved to the area we were automatically referred to a children disability social worker so they could sort out any funding we needed, I told him about  his love of throwing things out of the window and how he didn't like wearing clothes in the garden and she said that this is perfectly ok and quite normal for autistic children. Secondly when I told her I don't want to go through life assuming at everyone could be a pervert as it instilled fear and mistrust in my children she said ""this is where you and me are going to fall out"". 

I'm hoping she says something bitchy on facebook, which I don't have but my best friend does as she is ready to go nuts at her for the insinuation that her sons could be paedophiles.

Specifically, I'm looking for a 5-year-old girl with whom I work who has a great memory but isn't verbal and doesn't seem yet to have a great grasp of game rules that involve a lot of different/contingent steps. She's great with Memory, Zingo, etc, but not so good with games where you have to follow through with different directions depending on what you roll/spin/etc. 

If games are more challenging but still fun, I'm obviously happy to provide support and make modifications so she can experience success, but I don't want ones that are so out of reach that she doesn't enjoy them or understand/care what our goal is. I'd love to find some games that capitalize on her great memory/spatial skills but are more new/exciting/interesting than playing Memory over and over...

1172,Our son has autism and extreme hyperactivity and I want to vent a little... or maybe a lot.,"Throw away account to protect the innocent.  Ok, where to begin...

Our son was diagnosed when he was three years old.  Before that, before I was married to my wife, my wife had absolutely no idea why her son had so many massive behavioral issues.  What made it especially bad is that her father is a diagnosed borderline and a fundamentalist and essentially raised her in such a way that she blames herself for everything that goes wrong.  Long story there, don't want to get into it.

What it amounts to is that it took all her friends, several social workers from church, me, and the advice of a pediatrician to convince her that his behavior wasn't the result of her ""bad parenting.""

He wouldn't speak except in his own babble language, wouldn't sleep for more than two hours a day, wouldn't eat or drink anything to the extent that he was getting constipated and had cracked lips due to dehydration.  He was so hyper that she couldn't get him to even process what she wanted him to do much less get him to obey.  He had (and still has) massive violent temper tantrums whenever she tried to get him to do *anything.*

Finally convinced, we took him to a child psychologist to see what he had to say.  He, being an actual responsible doctor, saw him for a couple months before making his diagnosis.  What made it especially difficult is that the kid's biological father beat him and the doctor wasn't entirely sure what was fall out from that and what wasn't.  It was a trial to remain patient but we managed.

What finally turned the thing around was that, on his and the pediatricians advice, we tried Clonodine on him.  My wife, due to her upbringing, was utterly anti-meds but desperation convinced her.  That calmed him down enough that the autistic behaviors became obvious.

The psychologist says he's on the autism spectrum and directs us the autism center.  They confirm with a diagnosis of autism with extreme hyperactivity.  We then had enough diagnoses that we are able to get him into the special education program at school.  They work with him and things get a little better.  He starts speaking english in complete sentences, starts asking for things instead of pointing and screaming, etc.

The problem now is that we still have a great deal of trouble at home and we're still waiting until august, after several interviews and mountains of paperwork, for TouchPoint to show up and help us out with him at home.  And we've been told we got lucky, that most people have to wait upwards of six months to three years for help.  I can't even imagine...

We're doing what we can on our own.  We read everything we can get our grubby little hands on, we've set a firm routine, we started to figure out his stims and other quirks.  But we're not the experts and there's so much we still can't figure out.

He's four now.  He has less melt downs over situations we can avoid (he hates crowds and bright light) but the problem is that he also has meltdowns when we try to get him to eat right, to clean up his toys, to do anything he doesn't want to do, really.  And he's smart enough to find ways to do what he wants even if we forbid it.  He is, like his biological father, extremely strong and can climb to anywhere in the house, meaning that we can't hide any toys or treats from him when he misbehaves.

Taking his toys away is the only thing that worked (temporarily) because time outs were more of a punishment to us than him and corporal punishment was... well, you can't tell a kid that doesn't understand context not to hit while hitting him.

He still won't sleep.  Clonodine and melatonin worked for while but now he's used to it and still only sleeps two to four hours a night.  The problem with that is that he moves into to our bedroom and either plays so loudly it wakes us up or wakes us up in order to show us something (usually cute, but not at 3 am).

When he gets frustrated he hits objects and people and throws things.  Here's a list of the things he's destroyed so far:  All his toys except for match box cars, legos, and other essentially indestructible items, my nintendo ds, a window, several cd's, and my mom's tv (he threw a toy so hard it poked a hole in the screen.  Did I mention how unbelievably strong he is?).

We decided to not to replace anything he broke to see if that would convince him to stop.  It didn't.  Also, he's super clingy and the nintendo ds is the only thing we could give him that would keep him busy enough to let us cook, wash dishes, etc. without him literally climbing all over us.

We cracked about that the DS.  We were both convinced that we'd be super parents and wouldn't let our kids get super attached to electronic toys at the expense of everything else.  The problem is, most toys he either ignores or destroys and the DS was the only thing we had that would get him to play by himself for even a second.

Before that, he would never leave you alone, would grab whatever you were doing out of your hand and throw it, do anything he could to make you pay attention to him... for 20 to 22 hours a day.  Add to that the limited empathy and the fact that his main stims include hitting things with every part of his body and climbing all over stuff and it essentially amounts to us getting our asses kicked all day.  We constantly covered with bruises, not from brattiness, but because he's just trying to play with us :(

So, we were visiting a relative and they had a DS.  He found it played with it, and *left us alone for hours*.  I feel like such a shitty parent to let him play the DS for hours at a time but it gives us much needed time to get necessary things done.  We gave and him mine and for a while, things were much better (a lot of the bad behavior seems to come from boredom as much as autism).

Naturally, it was too good to be true.  In accordance with the law of the conservation of bullshit, solving any problem only creates new ones.  Now, we're having fights to get him to stop playing the DS enough to eat, bathe, and other necessary things...

We still have problems about getting him to eat in general.  He's hyposensitive to most things rather than hyper, so he only wants to eat things that are super sweet (and bad for him) or super spicy.  He basically fasts for two or three days, eats a whole lot one day, fasts, rinse repeat.  He has constipation all the time.

I hate - no - *utterly fucking loathe* - this disorder. I hate it, I hate me. I refuse to have children because if what they say is true, then it would be absolute cruelty to pass this disease onto them.

There is nothing good about autism. I can't make friends. I am drained doing the easiest things. I can't understand certain things. I stick out like a sore thumb everywhere I go. My sense of perception is so off that sometimes I question if I'm actually fucking retarded. Then there's the movement Thing.

Even the special interests/obsessions thing is jacked. No normal person probably seeks out every crumb of information on Doctor Who, or gets excited at the possibility of talking about Gallifrey or Sherlock. Nobody cares this much about what Doctor did what and when, timelines, canon, etc. People like to knit or crochet or have normal reactions to things or not be obsessed with their interests. They're not...this. 

Autism has destroyed my life and my chances at being successful. I may be a college graduate and supposedly intelligent, but I know that this disease - THIS PARASITE - has fucked me before I could even begin.

I do not hate myself, but I hate autism. If I had one wish, it would be that this parasitic disease would be wiped off the face of the planet.

My name is Nick Marks. I have a 5 year old girl. She does not have autism. I have a few close friends that do have children with autism. I am well aware of the challenges faced...daily. 

I am promoting my game all over but wanted to stop by here especially.  I made a phonics game that I think is perfect for a child with autism. A child who is beginning to read phonetically. I did everything in the game myself. Why is mine different? Well unlike ALL games out their...mine includes the parent or the teacher in the process of teaching. Most games exclude the parent or teacher. Frustrating the child. My game doesn't do the teaching. The parent or teacher does....allowing the child to still learn the way you know they learn best. In the words they understand. The game is really fun experience and a game that can only be played with Teacher and child. 

Hope you can see the power in this approach to games for kid. My game has already been tried out on a SP child and the parent and child had a blast. If you get it and like it or have suggestions to make it better let me know! I am going to be doing a whole line of learning games like this. I want kids and parents to play and learn together. Not apart.

1181,Just... Everything!,"People attack me when I try to explain to them I have HFA. I told them I've been given a diagnosis of Asperger's and ADHD and HFA but I don't know which one is right. People tell me EVERYONE has some form of autism or that it's over diagnosed. When I feel comfortable enough to confide in people they attack me and make me out to be a liar. It's nerve racking and gives me so much anxiety. I try to decide not to tell them EVER but then they mock me and the things I do. I tend to flap my hands, especially my right one. One of my peers started mimicking this action whenever I do it to mock me, he think's it's a great laugh! I try to put myself in social situations to help overcome some of my problems but it seems like I create conflict wherever I go. Whenever I try to explain I didn't mean harm to anyone and that sometimes I say things that are offensive unintentionally they say stuff like ""Asperger's doesn't give you the right to be rude"" or ""I don't care what you have, you don't get to be an asshole."" I'm not trying to use it as some excuse to get out of bad stuff I do but I want people to understand there's no intention behind it! How do I cope with this?

I have been with my 'husband' for almost a decade now. We're not married but we've been living together for two years and I don't like calling him my boyfriend. He hates when I stim it bothers him and he gets very annoyed with me. I try to do it alone in another room so it doesn't bug him but he comes in and stops me because he thinks it's unhealthy. Is it? I hate it when he makes me stop, I feel like my entire life is being interrupted for NOTHING!

I'm kind of alone out here really. My family threw me out after my diagnosis. They felt like it was an excuse for ""All the shitty things I'd been doing my whole life.""  My husband and his family is my support network but none of them have taken any time to understand what I've been diagnosed with. I identify most with Asperger's, maybe it's just the name, I don't know. I've had several diagnosis's but that was the most recent and the one that made the most sense. Either way he and his family have done nothing to look it up or understand it. To them once again it's just some sort of fake thing that doesn't actually exist and I'm just some rude weirdo.

When I stim I tend to rock, flap my hands, wiggle my hips and tap things. I don't think these are dangerous activities though I have come to understand now that doing them in public is absolutely unacceptable unless I really have to.

Edit: I talked to my husband some more and he's being more accepting but he still worries I'm hurting myself. There's no hope for his parents I believe.

1183,An Introduction... and a question,"So, my son, age 8 finally got a diagnosis. We'd seen counselors before, and a psychiatrist, and the general consensus was ADHD, and possibly a mood disorder. We finally got an evaluation from a Neuropsychologist and the diagnosis was ADHD, PDD-NOS &amp; GAD (general anxiety disorder).  She referred us to a therapist and a speech therapy place (to assist him with communication skills). 

I am meeting with a therapist at the place she recommended after work today and am curious if there is a specific sort of therapy that works well for kids with autism? The counselor he was seeing previously seemed to mainly do talk therapy, which didn't seem to accomplish anything, as far as I could tell. He doesn't talk about feelings or thoughts. He can talk for days about Minecraft or other video games, or books or movies, etc, but ask him about how he feels and zip! nada!  Our primary concern at the moment is his inability to respond appropriately to things - for example, the teacher puts a stack of work on his desk at school, son's brain quietly goes into over drive telling him that he must do all this work immediately, he must do it perfectly and not miss any question and if he does he'll fail and then he won't get into college and then he'll never get a job and OMG NOW I HAVE TO FREAK THE FUCK OUT and this situation seems to end with a desk on it's side and him running down the halls of the school. Now, we started him on Risperdal back in Feburary, which helped IMMENSELY, but that's obviously not a fix, it's just like a medical straight jacket to slow him down.

I know everyone is busy with their lives. I hope that you can spear me 5 minutes to help me complete this project. Can you please write a short paragraph about your personally experience regarding to these questions below?
1.	What problem have you encountered during IEP meeting?   Discuss your disagreement or bad experience that you have encountered with your child’s teacher and school?

2.	Does your non-disable child feel resent towards you or towards the sibling with disability? What do you hope for if your child participate in sibling support program?

3.	What type of support or resources are you specifically looking for (i.e. home therapy)?  How can these resources or support services can be beneficial to your child? Why do you think your child needs community supports and resources services?

1185,My brother's uncontrollable and i need some advice,"Hi guys sorry if this is a long post but i want to describe the situation fully in the hope that someone can offer help or advice. 

My youngest brother was diagnosed with autism at a young age, it was never really a problem, his tantrums rarely got out of hand and my family were content. He had a personal helper throughout primary school and his progress was described as remarkable to the point i remember forgetting he had autism. Now he's 13 and over 6ft tall (we're a tall family apart from my mum and er me, milkman?).

Since he's started secondary school his behaviour has regressed to the point i believe he might be dangerous to my family. He's never been punished or told no as he knows how to manipulate my mum into doing anything for him. I'll give an example of some of his episodes for context. I'm not really sure where to start as every day his behaviour gets more shocking

- He has hit my parents and brothers on countless occasions over trivial things for example i refused to give him a burger this morning so he snapped and hit me round the head twice then threatened to kill me. He will also throw himself against things and hit his head on cabinets. 

- He'll swear at anyone who says no to him including telling his headmistress to f*** off

- He's gone for knives before when in a fit. The police were called one night when my Dad couldn't control him, i was at university at this point so i'm unaware of the exact details. 

- He has no empathy or concept of other people's feelings for example he threw a huge tantrum on the day of my grandad's funeral because he wanted the new pokemon game.  My uncle, whose father the funeral was for, drove to Game (i'm from the UK by the way) to get it for him half an hour before the funeral. Nintendo and retro games is his obsession. 

- He refuses to go to bed until around 2-3 at night which means none of my family who live at home have had a proper night sleep in the last 3 or so years which has turned my mum into an exhausted wreck.

- He will accuse people of trying to murder him, of being pedophiles (this includes teachers, myself and my parents) and just blatantly lie to get his way. For example he refused to go to school this morning because he said there was a women hiding in the bushes waiting to smash his phone. This one worried me, he most likely has anger management issues but could there be other issues in addition to autism? he convinced himself he couldn't go to school otherwise this women in the bushes would break his phone, maybe he might be slightly schizophrenic? or he might just be trying to avoid school i'm merely speculating.

I could literally go on for hours my point being he's becoming extremely aggressive, is uncontrollable when he's in a full fit, has no concept of reason and refuses to go to bed at a reasonable time.

How has it affected the family? Me and my older brother have been at university for the last few years so have missed the worst of it. I would get phone calls from my mum every few days in tears. She's an emotional, depressed wreck but refuses to get any help for herself. My Dad's work has suffered as a result of limited sleep and my other brother has been going into exams exhausted.

He towers over my mum and is surprisingly strong for a 13 year old, it takes more then one of us to restrain him. After this summer the house will be my youngest brother and my parents alone for the first time as me and my other two brothers go to university. My dad works all day so she will be alone with him when he's not at school. Im genuinely worried something will happen, he's only going to get taller and more out of control, my parents have seen a few specialists and he's on melatonin, but today i finally lost the last bit of hope i had   after he tried to hit my mum at 2AM while she was trying to go to bed because he wanted her to buy him a screwdriver off amazon to open his old NES cartridges.

However I love the kid, when he's not having a tantrum he's the funniest and best company to jam with, as my mum says he's like Dr Jackal and Mr Hyde. He has a sense of humour far beyond his years having been brought up with 3 older brothers and spending his life on the internet. He'll hug me goodnight and take the piss out of me when we're joking around he's so much fun. 

So reddit what the feck can we do? Apparently there's places we could send him who are more capable of looking after him and my mum could get her life back but it would be completely heartbreaking. I never thought i would think it and resented my family for saying it but it might be time to send him somewhere else. Im worried he might become a danger to society, he's going to get bigger and more uncontrollable what if he takes a liking to a girl and does something terrible?

Any advice would be appreciated, as i mentioned he's currently on melatonin but has little professional help as he refuses to talk to them at meetings. He doesn't have a personal helper at secondary school and their main tactic with dealing with him is to give him detentions and reduce his school hours. This probably isn't the best way of handling him but he's already moved schools once.

If there's anyone in a similar situation please let me know. Any suggestions are welcome and i can fill in anymore details if needed. 

TL;DR 13 year old autistic brother is violent and uncontrollable, my mums a wreck and its only going to get worse as he gets older please

#UPDATE So as i mentioned my parents were having a meeting with the school and i went along to it today for the first time. I stressed the need for medication and psychiatric help. As a result about 5 people are referring him for rest-bite care to get him professional help such as medication. In addition they're funding me to go away to Cornwall with him for a week with other kids with special needs and professionals, hopefully this will give my parents a deserved rest and get my bro away from his computer and games for a while. Thanks for all the advice i'll update further when there's developments. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/v98rz/my_brothers_uncontrollable_and_i_need_some_advice/,813
1186,What should I expect?,"

I have concerns that my 19 month old son is autistic and we have an appointment in the upcoming week to discuss it with his PCP. I'm really nervous about what to expect in the screening/diagnosis process. I'm worried about what kind of stress it's going to put on him.

The things that have been raising my concern have been becoming more and more apparent over the past 3-4 months. I didn't want to put off making an appointment any longer; the little research I've done so far has told me that the best thing for a child with autism is to find out early and go from there.



The things that have been raising my concerns are;

* **Delayed speech**. He says a few words (Hi, Mom, Dad, 'Bubble' in reference to 'Bubble Guppies' which is a cartoon he is obsessed with.) Whereas his twin brother has a very, very wide vocabulary and even says several phrases. *(But he also having a procedure done soon because his upper-lip frenulum is attached between his two front teeth, and we think that may have something to do with his speech being hindered)* But, he also has this habit of saying words once, very quietly like he's whispering.. and then not saying them again.
* **High-strung**. He is generally a really happy toddler, full of smiles and giggles... but when he gets upset, all hell breaks loose. I can't so much as raise my voice around him without him having a meltdown. It also doesn't take much for him to have a meltdown. As mentioned above, he is absolutely fascinated with ""Bubble Guppies."" In the morning while we wake up, the boys will have their milk and watch their once-daily episode of Bubble Guppies. He will usually have a massive meltdown when it goes to commercial and tenfold when the show is over.
* **Violent(?) Temper-tantrums**. When he throws fits, he will hit himself in the head. He has also hit his head against walls and against the floor. Even recently, I stepped outside to feed our dogs and left the door open, but a glass screen-door closed. He went into a meltdown and started screaming and hitting his head very hard against the glass until I came back in. Sometimes when he throws fits, he will also pinch/bite me... if not just out-right slap me across the face.
* **""Selective"" Hearing**. (I'm not sure if there's a better term for that.) He generally will not respond to his name. Sometimes he just kind of.. walks around in his own little world and only makes contact when he feels like it.
* **Toys are not toys**. He is very, very analytical and observant of toys before he plays with them. He will stack them, arrange them. He will analyze every possible side and angle of the object. He seems to ""test"" them, banging them against various surfaces and then banging another toy almost as if he's comparing the outcome. The entire time he has this very, very determined and analytical look on his face. Only after his toys have gone through this rigorous testing can he actually play with them regularly.
* **Rocking**. It started off where he would get on his hands and knees and rock back and forth to fall asleep.. this being since he was even nine months old. But now, he will just randomly get on the floor during the day and do that same thing while kind of humming to himself. And when he watches Bubble Guppies (what else?!) he will rock back and forth on the couch.


Other than that.. He's a very loving, warm, sweet, affectionate kid. He plays well with his brother and in public places, he is pretty out-going and tries to play with other kids. He is even social towards adults. Probably more-so towards adults.

I don't think he is mentally challenged. He has always shown a great deal of intelligence. He can identify body parts. If I ask him where his nose is, for example, he will point to it. The same goes for objects. He uses gestures a lot to get his point across. Great problem solving skills, as well. He can do things for himself easily, get things for himself easily, and even get his point across.


I am scared. I'm not sure what I am scared of, though. I think most parents just want their kids to have a normal life and be treated like a normal person. That's probably my biggest fear - being the outcast, the kid that gets picked on because he's sensitive or does things differently. I can love him to pieces and make sure he knows that on a daily basis... but the older he gets, the less I will be able to protect him from shitty people. 

I feel guilty - almost like I'm perpetuating some stigma about people with autism because I am scared. But it's not that. I just feel so unprepared for this. I feel like maybe I'm putting the cart before the horse. But I'm pretty goddamned positive he is. And I don't know what to do, what I can do to for my baby to make sure that he gets everything that he needs to reach his full potential. I don't want to be in this state of mind 20 years from now where I'm saying, *""I should have done this, or that, or that.. or even that!""* I have bipolar disorder, a panic and anxiety disorder, and OCD. It wasn't dealt with until I was 15 and it fucked my life up. I realize fully that my parents just... didn't know how to handle it. And that is the exact position that I want to avoid being in.


Christ, this is making me emotional. It's just new. And it's a little scary. Any thoughts/opinions/advice is more than welcomed..

1187,I'm dating a guy with autism and i really need some advice/help,"my boyfriend has mild autism but as time goes on it has become more noticable as he grows distant from me for reasons i'm not comprehending. i've done my best to avoid sexual contact when he doesn't want it, i try my best to ensure that his needs and wants are adequately satisfied and i've done everything in my power to help him be more comfortable with himself, his orientation (not sure if it makes a difference but we're a gay couple) and his difficulty making friends in school. i love him dearly and have seriously considered the possibility of marriage in the future but i'm not sure i can if our relationship continues to deteriorate like this. any advice or help from a person with autism or in my situation would be greatly appreciated.

UPDATE: after reading all the advice you guys gave me (and lurker i'm buying that book for the future) i sat down and spoke with him and we talked for a really long time. turns out he was fairly scared since his mother had talked to him about the concepts of relationships, sex and she refused to accept his orientation as something he could choose, she told him his mind was playing tricks on him and he was disturbed about that. he also said some of the jokes that i had made about our sex life (didn't know this was terribly offensive before since me and my other partners did it all the time) were making him question how i felt about him. so i'm going to work on being a better boyfriend and stop with the few but sarcastic quips as well as an educator i guess on how he should deal with his orientation and his condition, but the advice and ideas you all proposed were absolutely brilliant, thank you all so much!",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/v5msc/im_dating_a_guy_with_autism_and_i_really_need/,815

Since we work with primarily preschool and early elementary school aged children, our camps consists mostly of crafts, stories, and field games, not traditional camp stuff (hiking, canoeing, archery etc). This week I have been working closely with one high-functioning autistic camper and it has really been a struggle for me. Its not that I don't have the patience or desire to help her, I just have absolutely no idea what I should do. I don't want to discipline her for disruptive behavior, but I also don't want her to be detrimental to the experiences of others. Usually we ignore kids who are crying over nothing (only because they do it for attention--we're not mean!), but would it be better if I comforted her? She cries pretty frequently.

1196,My 24 mo old son has obsessions. Could it be an ASD?,"Something does not seem right with my 24 mo old son. I have been put on a 10 mo waiting list to see a developmental pediatrician, but until then all I can do is just sit and wonder.

Ever since my son was about 13-14 months, he developed a SEVERE obsession to letters and numbers. From the moment he opens his eyes in the morning until he goes to sleep. He chants the alphabet all day long, non-stop. He seeks out  letters and numbers everywhere ( a plate is an O to him). He counts everything, NON-STOP. We walk down the street and he counts everything around him. He doesn't really care to notice objects, but just to count and spell everything he sees. He also loves to sign the alphabet.  I try to distract him  to no avail.  I hide all things in the house that are letters or numbers to encourage him to play with his regular toys, but he has no interest in playing with the toys. Instead of playing with the toys, he will count the toys or starts saying the letter of the name that each toy begins with. His behavior does not seem normal.

Through this severe obsession, he taught himself to read at 20 months. People that see him doing these ""cool things"" think it's awesome that such a young kid can do these things, but the weird part is that even though he may seem advanced because he can read, he is delayed in other areas. Aside from the reading, he doesn't talk. He doesn't know how to express himself. He doesn't even understand the simplest things such as ""give me that ball"". He gets lost in the simplest questions.  Also, even though he loves letters and decoding them, he hates being read to. If I try to read him a book he will walk away or smacks the book out of my hands. However, he will sit by himself for long periods of time looking through the books. 

Sometimes it may appear that he is talking, but he isn't. He repeats the word that was just said to him without understanding what he is saying. I worry about ASD, but at the same time I'm not sure because he can make great eye contact, and he is very affectionate. I've also heard of an ASD condition called Hyperlexia that seem to fit him.  I'm confused and don't know what to make of his weird obsessive behavior.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/uyt06/my_24_mo_old_son_has_obsessions_could_it_be_an_asd/,59
1197,Eye Contact Question,"I work with kids with autism, mostly between the ages of 3 and 10, although sometimes older. The company I work for provides one-on-one school support and home sessions (both of which I do). 

One of the skills we work on with the kids is eye contact. I understand the purpose of this -- eye contact is pretty much expected in our society, and the ability to make it will likely help our kids form and maintain social relationships in life. However, I've also read about how uncomfortable (in terms of emotional overload) it can be for people with autism (or autistic people, depending on your naming preference).

To be clear, we do not punish for not making eye contact (or anything else, for that matter) -- we are not ever punitive; in fact, we're forbidden from saying ""no""... everything has to be worded/staged in terms of the positive and strengths and reinforcement. But we do ask for eye contact and if it isn't made, we'll continue asking and provide some prompts (usually verbal/pointing, sometimes making a ""tunnel"" with our hands between our faces so the kid looks at us -- but personally I try to avoid that; it just seems a bit intrusive to me). Then we reinforce any success with enthusiasm.

So my question, to those with autism or any other professionals/relatives/etc: What are your opinions? Will eye contact ever improve naturally, without it being worked on/reinforced like this? Is it actually distressing, or just kind of uncomfortable (it doesn't seem distressing with any of my kids, but they're quite young and some are nonverbal, so they can't really explain how they feel to me)? Any suggestions for understanding and working on the skill?

Thanks for any insight you can provide!",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/uxh1v/eye_contact_question/,59
1198,"After all those years with Doctors who never fixed 
anything, it turns out my Autism was DIRECTLY 
linked to my diet. (A Gluten &amp; Casein Free diet post)","Please forgive me if this is on the wrong board, I already mis-posted on /r/ADHD, hopefully I've found the place this should go this time. Before I talk about what a success I've found this diet to be in my life afflicted with Autism, I'd like to give you a back story. (Tl;dr on the bottom) My name is Ryan. I am a male who was diagnosed with severe ADHD as a child, and later on found out I had Aspergers syndrome. Growing up, I was essentially a pill mule for every ADHD and Autism related ""cure"" out there. I was told I'd never function in a social environment properly. My school life was essentially spent with people who really weren't that smart, yet when I tested out of those class rooms, I was always shot down due to having ""Autism"".

At age 16, Currently I am 22, I swore off any kind of pharmaceutical drugs, as they only worked temporally and made me feel like a zombie for the majority of that time. Once I got off the meds, I had energy spikes all over the place and couldn't control my thought process for too long. I learned to deal with it. At around age 17 or 18, I heard about Neurofeedback and gave it a shot, It worked for me, but only temporarily and it was far too expensive. I went down to Florida for my 20 to 21 year old days, where I found myself staying inside far too long and ended up getting sick of things and moving back to NC.

I found a “holistic” (Yes, I know that dirty word) doctor who was telling me about diets and people with Autism have a lot of links with food allergies &amp; inflammation. She gave me a food Allergy test (IgG food allergy test), which came back and showed me that I had an allergy to pretty much everything that was on my diet as an adult. Milk with Casein in it, Soy, Gluten, Most Nuts, Rice, and more (I can dig out the testing results if need be, they're in here somewhere). I figured why the hell not try this out, I changed my diet for a bit, and didn't notice any difference. Apparently though, people started commenting on how I acted different and responded in a different tone. I apparently was so disconnected from my body that I couldn't even tell that I was behaving differently. 

Tl;dr It's been about a year since I've been on this Gluten &amp; Casein free diet thing, and since that time, I've been in college and passed (with more than just a C- unlike high school), I've acquired my first job, My social life has improved, my health and physical condition has been overall better (lost over 25 lbs AND consistently  brushing my teeth daily). I've started Driving as well which I know I'm really late to the start with. I can hold eye contact in a conversation, which for me is an amazing feat considering I couldn't hold still much less hold my eyes still long enough to do such a thing. Conversations with people actually connect with me, instead of just feeling like a blank, gray slate with a facade response. The weirdest thing about this diet is that if I eat something I have a 2+ allergy to, I will show “signs” of Autism for about a day, then they go away in about 2 days or so.

 This is the largest scale change in my life, without a doubt, and I would like to inform others of this change and hopefully have them see if they can try the same thing. Being the guinea pig for every drug out there, I would have enjoyed knowing about this before I spent my overall life with Autism. I am open to answering any questions about this diet and my life with Autism if need be, I really feel that this should be out there for more people to know about then continue staying uninformed and just knocking back pills.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/uwsf1/after_all_those_years_with_doctors_who_never/,820

1202,Am I in the autism spectrum?,"I'm really confused about whether or not I fall into the autism spectrum.

I thought offering a little bit of my family history would be a good start. My mother has very obvious symptoms of ADHD and OCD. She either doesn't make contact when speaking to you, or she forces it, awkwardly. She's exceedingly impulsive and socially inappropriate (one time she kept asking my vegetarian friend if he wanted meatloaf, over and over again). She's also a hoarder and it's very hard to force her to throw anything away. She displays a lot of child-like behavior and isn't very socially adept.

Onto my characteristics. I'm not a fan of loud noises, though it isn't necessarily painful for me to experience them. I'm a very sensitive person and easily skittish and nervous. If I'm not paying attention and someone touches me or starts talking to me, I will most likely jump or scream. I have a hard time socially. It's sometimes easy for me to look people in the eyes, but other times I find it to be very awkward, and I will jump between eye contact with a person and another part of the room. I looked at a video of myself when I was around six years old, and I could hardly stand still. When talking in place as a child I held my foot a lot, and spun and danced in my spot.

I know I have both ADHD and OCD (self diagnosed) because I have at least 3/4 symptoms for both. When I was in high school it was extremely difficult for me to pay attention and I was depressed a lot. I'm also very impulsive, or used to be, until I made a lot of effort to alter my behavior and learn to calm down and think before acting. I also take lots of supplements that are supposed to help people with ADHD, OCD and depression. I wasn't truly able to alter my behavior until I started taking them, so I'm assuming a lot of the behavior is still lying beneath the surface, and can't easily be changed by merely 'thinking differently'.

I still tend to walk on my toes unconsciously, which people often point out. I have a hard time staying completely still and often have to tap my foot or fiddle with something in my hands or touch myself in some way. I've also been very clumsy in the past and I have to make my self conscious of my physical surroundings or I tend to bump into things, not hold things securely enough, or trip. I still have a problem with making neat handwriting and I can barely sign my name in cursive.

I'm a very affectionate person who loves to be hugged and touched -- just not all the time. I find weight from clothing and especially blankets to be very comforting. I remember feeling almost twitchy when my anxiety is high, like I'm going to jump out of my bed if I don't have at least some weight on me.

I can also research a topic for hours if it interests me, and forget the people around me and my physical surroundings during the process. I'm a very self-conscious person and worry about what others think of me. I'm often paranoid that I'm going to hurt people's feelings, or that people dislike me. I care a lot about the people around me, but I don't always feel like I can meet their needs or expectations and this depresses me.

I also experience a lot of convoluted thinking, and was probably the opposite of logical in the past. This could have easily have stemmed from my own ignorance and the learning environment that I grew up in, or it could be attributed to my own paranoia and coping mechanisms.

Because I'm not the best in social situations, I try to analyze how people act around me and decode what people like. I find lately though, that because my supplements make it a lot less likely for me to be hurt emotionally, that I am much more rebellious socially. In some ways, being hurt emotionally in the past was the only thing that stopped me from acting the way that I wanted to in larger groups (the classroom, for example). Even when I'm rebellious though, I feel like my self esteem is still very low. I find it very hard to perform when I feel inferior, and this has made it very difficult for me to conduct presentations during my college experience. I feel like I have to push myself socially and that I feel exhausted when I do. In a perfect world I could be left alone by everyone but the people closest to me, and I'd be happy. I don't know where to draw the line between introversion and social anxiety vs. being in the autism spectrum though.. I've gotten a lot better, regardless, as I've grown up. I'm twenty-eight now.


What do you think? I'd really like to understand if I lie somewhere in the spectrum so I can formulate a better plan to approach my school and future work environment.

1203,An act of kindness.,"I had to share this moment with y'all. I was in Arizona for a wedding and happened to go to the Celtic Crossing pub in Prescott for dinner one night. There was about 18 of us at the table, an assortment of kids, parents, grandparents and my Brother-in-law. My BIL is 23 years old and mostly non functioning autistic. He usually hates eating out especially if there is a lot of ambient noise. That night there was a singer, Karl Jones, at the restaurant. For close to three hours he played non stop as we ate and talked and drank. My BIL smiled and rocked to the music and seemed to have a better time than usual. As we were leaving, I stopped to put a five in the tip jar in between songs and Mr. Jones put his guitar down and asked to meet, 'that guy'. I thought he meant big Jim, the patriarch of the family at close to 84. He said no, the young man who's been smiling all night and pointed to my BIL. Well, I brought him up and the singer shook his hand and gave him CD. The same CD he has been charging people 20 bucks for all night. He said, ""let him listen to this and it will remind him of tonight when he was so happy"". So thank you Karl Jones, for a great night of music and a great act of compassion. Usually people only see my BIL's *condition*, but you saw his humanity and joy.

TL;DR A singer at the pub gave me autistic brother a free cd after watching him rock and smile all night.
Update: My BIL really does enjoy listening to the music from the cd on his IPod Shuffle.

Please don't get offended; I'm trying to understand for a paper.,"To start with, I understand that Autism is a spectrum disorder that can affect people any number of ways and with a wide variety of severity. The questions that are posed to parents are for instances with children who are more severe.

I'm writing a paper for school about disability and parenthood. In case it matters- I am studying Speech Language Pathology. I truly believe that everyone should be able to communicate to their full extent. That's why I'm taking my class so seriously and truly trying to understand.

If your child decided that they wanted to become a parent- what would you do?

If you feel comfortable going a little deeper- what would you say to them? How does their cognitive, physical and financial situation impact this?

He can 'Houdini' out of any zip-up pajamas, even with the zipper safety pinned, he can get out of overalls, even with his compression vest ultra-velcroed.

1208,"We overcame teeth-brushing trials...what are some of your, or a loved ones, major triumphs?","My six year old daughter is autistic and, for a very long time, brushing her teeth was a nightmare.  When she was younger she refused to let us brush her teeth, or, if we got a brush close enough, she wouldn't let us brush them well.  Our dental office couldn't seem to handle having an autistic patient but they were all we could afford at the time.  Eventually her teeth rotted and required oral surgery.  After drama with the current office and eventually switching dentists she had a fixed up mouth and an amazing new smile. 

However, we had just spent four figures (thank goodness for payment plans) on her baby teeth, so my husband and I knew something had to change.  We cracked down on teeth brushing.  Most nights this meant an hour long fight culminating in one of us holding her down while the other scrubbed her teeth.  It was traumatic for all of us.  We tried all sorts of routines and tricks and most nights it felt like I would have to brush her teeth when she went to college.  But...things started to get better.  

It's been two years since she had oral surgery and for most of that brushing her teeth has been a challenge.  Then, the other night, we told her it was time to brush her teeth.  She left the room and we gave her a few minutes, thinking that she was probably trying to avoid the dreaded ritual.  But then, when we went looking for her, she was in the bathroom...finishing brushing her teeth.  All by herself.  I was almost in tears I was so proud.  It made me realize how far she had come and it gives me hope that all the issues we still have (washing her hair, I'm looking at you) will one day be but a memory.

I wanted to share that and I thought here was a good place.  But I would love to hear your success stories.  If you are autistic or know some who is, I would love to hear stories of triumph!

1209,Question about symptoms,"I tried to answer this with google first, but couldnt. Sorry if it sounds kind of odd.

Im in my early 20s and was recently diagnosed with add. I was talking to my lomg term gf about unrelated oddities in how i think and behave and she half-joked that it sounded like i was autistic. I looked up general symptoms out of curiousity, and i dont have any of the problems with understanding social cues, but i feel like i fit a lot of the other descriptions.

* I use the same phrases repeatedly, and have to conciously not use them to avoid being brutally repetative.

* I am obsessive about organization. Not in cleaning my apartment, but concepts and ideas have to have categories and heirarchies, even with mundane things like movie characters and philosophical concepts.

* Breaks in routine can throw me off completely, such as being completel unable to find high school classes for the entire day following a morning assembly.

* I am very easily distracted and frustrated by noises and movements, such as a leg bouncing in my peripheral visiom or a repeated noise made by a fan reversing direction back and forth.

* Once i have a topic in my mind, i will obsess over it for hours or days until i cant vent the thoughts, often by writing about them or creating a relevant diagram or visual.

* I take over conversations when im uncomfortable or feel like a bad conversationalist, and i talk much more quickly and rambly when anxious.

* My speech is often unnecessarily formal, and i often use words that are much more advanced speech than they need to be.

* i am very bad at multitasking and lose track of what im doing very quickly when other elements, even just someone asking me a question, are involved.

* I tune out very easily, and can drift into my own thoughts without realizing.

* Even though i like my thoughts to be organized, the same doesnt apply to my obligations, and i frequently get tasks and due dates mixed up and forgotten.

* I am very bothered by little things that are inconsistent, like a dvd set missing one of the dvds or a book series in which one of the book covers lacks a trait common to the rest.

Im not sure what else, but i figured i had to ask if anyone had any insight. I dont mean to suggest that i am autistic, but am just curious what the subscribers here would make of this. Thanks.

1210,I'd like to get some feedback on my video presentation hypothesizing an evolutionary source for human neurodiversity,"[Here's a 10-minute overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk_85vNaSMA)

[Here's the full presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6-6Naz-C0M)

This is the abstract of [a paper I wrote to further explain this hypothesis](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B3dPqM3qgNSiY3p5TmFRMjhSekdyaV8wWUw0MTZiUQ):

&gt; ASDs (autism spectrum disorders) are hypothesized as one of many adaptive human cognitive variations that have been maintained in modern populations via multiple genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Introgression from ""archaic"" hominids (adapted for less demanding social environments) is conjectured as the source of initial intraspecific heterogeneity because strict inclusive fitness does not adequately model the evolution of distinct, copy-number sensitive phenotypes within a freely reproducing population.

&gt; Evidence is given of divergent encephalization and brain organization in the Neanderthal (including a ~1520 cc cranial capacity, larger than that of modern humans) to explain the origin of the autism subgroup characterized by abnormal brain growth.

&gt; Autism and immune dysfunction are frequently comorbid. This supports an admixture model in light of the recent discovery that MHC alleles (genes linked to immune function, mate selection, neuronal ""pruning,"" etc.) found in most modern human populations come from ""archaic"" hominids.

&gt; Mitochondrial dysfunction, differential fetal androgen exposure, lung abnormalities, and hypomethylation/CNV due to hybridization are also presented as evidence.

1215,Today my son was mocked for being different. ,"My son just turned 4 years old and is a healthy 3""6, 72 lbs (he is off the chart big). He was diagnosed with autism over 2 years ago. Also note he is non verbal and doesn't communicate with sign, but he is mobile.   Today we were enjoying the beautiful weather in central NJ. My son was playing by himself under the slide, not on the slide, but under it (because it is dark and away from the loud kids). He has a favorite toy snake he brings with him every place we travel. Ever since he was a baby he would self stimulate with the snake to ground himself. There were also two boys about 7 or 8 sitting under the playground equipment hiding from other kids. First the one boy asked to see my son's snake. My son didn't respond or look in his direction. The second boy asked my son if he was deaf. This sparked the interest in my father who was standing next to me. So being the protective non-aggressive pop pop he slid closer to my son to observe the situation more close. Then the boys exited there hiding spot to get more friends to taunt my son some more. So now there are 4 boys asking my son if he is stupid, deaf, slow, retarded, or just rude. My father finally had enough and said to the boys. ""yes there is something different with him, DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?"" The one boy finally said ""see I told you!"" and smacked the other boy the back of the head.(lol) My son was not effected by these boys actions or words (as far as I know) But it was heart breaking to see what my son is going to endure from ignorant people. 

On a lighter note: we went to the mall after and he walked up to a total stranger and gave him a hug. The boy was a good sport about it and hugged back. So I suppose deep down inside he can forgive.

1216,Favorite Children's Books about Autism/Aspergers?,"For a long time, I've been looking for a great book to help explain Autism/Aspergers to young children.

1218,Has anyone else read Carly's Voice? ,"Carly is a 14 year old girl with autism who, while being non verbal, has learned to type.  Her father and her co-wrote Carly's Voice, a book about her experiences. More info here: 
http://carlysvoice.com/

I'm interested in hearing what others, particularly those with children with autism thought of this book. I don't have much experience with children on the spectrum but I do work with several adults who have autism. 

My thoughts:
While the size of Carly's accomplishments cannot be understated, it was what went unsaid in this book that seemed to speak the loudest to me.  While Carly's ability to type and the obvious mental development she shows in her words are amazing, they are by and large the result of a lifetime of intensive one on one therapy.  Carly's therapists are acknowledged extensively in the book but what isn't said is the fact that many (or most) children with autism could likely achieve what she has, if they had access to the same programming she did.  Several times it comes up that Carly or her father does not want her to be around 'lower functioning' children, and it seems as though her father prefers to think of his daughter as a gifted, special child with autism rather than acknowledge that many of these 'lower functioning' children could realistically be at Carly's level if they had been born into a family able to afford the level of care Carly received.  Rather than feeling compassion for these children they are almost dismissed as 'below' them.  This is highlighted especially well when it is repeatedly acknowledged that Carly still partakes in many behaviors classified as 'lower functioning' (stimming, rocking, slapping, making noises, outbursts, etc) but doesn't want to be with individuals classed as lower functioning, while she herself insists that these people have an inner voice and intelligence similar to her own, especially when the only difference (in my eyes) is the money and therapy she had available to her. 

Beyond this the father goes on to disparage the respite and supported living programs offered to people with autism, using overdramatic language such as describing lighting as 'urine coloured' instead of just 'yellow'.  He doesn't look past his disgust for the support workers or house directors who, for the most part, are doing the best they can with what little funding they have.  He blames them for the 'poor' care in these facilities when really it is government underfunding that has caused these problems. 

Overall I applaud Carly's work at becoming an autism advocate, but I wish that more acknowledgement had been given to role her socio-economic status played in getting her where she is.    I think her and her father continuing to subtly place less value on 'lower functioning' individuals is a direct contradiction to Carly's insistence people with autism have an inner voice and intelligence that is not recognized.  As an autism advocate myself I believe the real boon to people with autism comes as a package - we need to raise the perceived value of people with autism AND work to ensure everyone with autism can access the level of care Carly received without having to be born into a well-off family or go massively into debt. 

I have a tendency to be overcritical (thanks university!) and I acknowledge this might be nitpicky, but criticism sparks discussion, and what I'm really interested in is the opinions of others with autism.  I will admit I am fairly new to the world of autism, having only worked in the field for a little under a year, so any responses would be greatly appreciated.

1219,"So I just learned my brother has autism, and I'm really not sure what this means.","I know the technicalities of it all. But here are details. My brother is 12, he has always been anti-social, intelligent, obsessive, and emotionally sensitive. My mom told me last night that they went to a consultation and he has been officially diagnosed with autism (not sure of details, a lot has happened today and yesterday, so my house is in chaos, we had a family friend go into critical condition this morning). I'm assuming it's very mild, because he's functioned fine in elementary and just this year his first year in middle school. He is just... Anti-social. He doesn't have friends or a desire to go out and make any. Also this is (from what i've seen) a late diagnosis? I really just don't know. 

My questions are simple. I'm 22 (soon to be 23) and away at college most of the time but home for a few months. What does this mean? Is there something I should do? Is there anything I can do? What does this mean for his future ( I saw a post about someone who said no one believed he would get a BA because he's autistic). He's very smart and I'm sure he could go and do something great for himself. I want him to be successful in life... I'm just trying to figure out what this all means. Thanks reddit.

1220,Types of programs within ABA.,"I am a mother of two children with autism ages 4 and 2. I'm frustrated because even though our ABA vendor works very well with us. Provides a general flow chart of the ABA programs that they provide. ie: self help skills, language, vocabulary. Is there a resource on the internet that is more specific to the types of ABA programs that are out there? My daughter generalizes pretty fast and is bored with her current programs. 

    The typical answers we receive from our vendor are similar to this: ""Every case and child is different"" 
It is my belief that they don't want to provide more specific programs because they don't want others to think for themselves and start wanting to teach their own children. That's not necessarily my intent, but I'd like to be prepared and help out my children as much as I can because I love them and they are young and teachable.

The following is an excerpt from [the musician's response](http://tylergregorymusic.com/fr_journal.cfm):

&gt; It was an ordinary day, walking to my regular spot to busk when I don't have a gig that night, and play music on the corner for a rotating crowd. When Jacob came over I felt excited about having another kid listen to the music. (Makes my day when kids dance to the music on the street... I already had a couple come over that day so it was already nice). However, unlike most kids that come up to me with curiosity, I felt so much energy coming off of him and I was completely overwhelmed. His hand on my leg was very powerful and about brought me to tears while playing. Not because he is blind or autistic.. but because of a connection I have never felt and one that is impossible to explain. Honestly, a feeling that came from my toes all the way up my body and surrounded me. I can't begin to explain it. I want to try to put it into words, but there is no way to tell how powerful his energy felt.

1224,"I need some help, advice, and some sanity","My wife &amp; I have been married 17 years. We have a 15 yr old daughter, twin 10 year old boys, and an 8 year old baby girl.
My wife is a type 1 insulin dependent diabetic. Her glucose fluctuations are from stress more than what she eats.


This focuses on my twins, who have recently been diagnosed with high functioning Autism...

 Being born at 21 weeks, they were in incubators for the first two-three months of life. We were told that they might not talk, walk, or function in society ""normally"". Throughout this, they were responsive to me/mom talking &amp; touching them, we even did the 'Kangaroo' thing with them. They were communicative, as babies can be...

However, when they went for their check-up &amp;n immunizations, everything went downhill quickly. After receiving the MMR, they *were* different. While I don't believe the vaccines themselves caused anything, it definitely made it more apparent that my boys were having issues.

At a year and a half, they began to walk.The best attempt at speech was still gurgles &amp; giggles, until they were frustrated. When frustrated, they would repeatedly bang their heads into the floor, wall, concrete, table, door, to the point of bruising &amp; bleeding. This continued until they were between 4 &amp; 5, when we broke them through spanking them on *every* occasion.

We went to many doctors, or at least the ones our insurance allowed us to see, and were always told the same thing : the behavior is a result of them being premature. We asked for more referrals &amp; specialists, just to have the doctors deny it, and then the insurance company denied it based on the doctors. We were consistently told that our boys have a discipline problem, nothing more, and were pointed back to the fact that *we* got the head banging to stop.

Fast forward to school year 1. When the boys couldn't do their work, they were reprimanded. When they would fall asleep in class after a morning meltdown, they were reprimanded. When they weren't able to keep up with the class, they were reprimanded.My children couldn't make friends, couldn't keep up with classes, and were ridiculed by the school/teachers/principal/students for being, in their words, difficult children with a discipline problem.

Year 2 : We were taken to court by the state, for the excessive unexcused tardys and five (yes, five) unexcused absences. During court, we were told by a judge that the issue was our children were manipulating us, trying to manipulate the school, and we should have our children move in with relatives because my wife was, according to the court, too sick to care for them. During the court cases, my wife was hospitalized three times in DKA.

I was so mad that I told the judge that I would school them at home, and he &amp; his court, along with the school system &amp; DHR in Lee County,Al were beyond their bounds. While my kids had to attend a school, there is no law on which school.

We decided to home school them for the rest of year 2. We completed the courses with the boys, and were ready to advance them to grade 3. DHR decided that they didn't like our choice in homeschooling, and began the intimidation tactics, threatening us with removing our children from the home, in their words, because we were neglecting our children. It wasn't until we were going to court (the fifth time, I believe) that our lawyer told us that DHR was going to make a case against us. We were informed that they would use my wifes diabetes, saying this prevented her from caring for the kids 'to a reasonable degree'. He also informed us that Alabama DHR is a sovereign entity, and could not be counter sued for anything. He also told us that the only way to get DHR out of our lives was to move out of the state.

I then decided to make an adjustment, and to take seriously the next offer I was presented. We relocated to Pa with high hopes. Our hopes have been dashed, yet again. The new school was more than willing to accommodate us &amp; the boys, and finally, we felt relief, if only for a while.

My twins are Alpha &amp; Beta, as most twins are. Alpha twin had a hard time accepting that this school was different, and that his history at the other school was just that, history. He would act out, testing these new surroundings &amp; the people that policed them. Around this time, their current principal called the school in Al, and heard the claims that the boys were in need of 'strapping', from the principals own words. Immediately after this, the school changed stance. No longer willing to help, every outburst or meltdown was met with suspensions.Despite repeated trips to the school, Alpha was expelled for taking a plastic sword to class on show &amp; tell. His expulsion, officially, was because he brought a weapon to school. The truth is because the school &amp; principal was past the breaking point, and since there was three weeks left in the year, this was as good an opportunity as they would likely get.

Since Alpha was soo alpha, Beta was out of the spotlight, but still struggling. Alpha was placed in a cyber school, while Beta continued with public school. Now alone in the schools radar, the before overlooked behavior of Beta was scrutinized daily. His sleeping in class, after meltdowns, has been met with reprimands. He is constantly bullied by kids in his class (he is older), and since he won't respond because they are younger, he gets picked on. The school has responded to this bullying by suspending him for a total of 9 days this year.

We were taken to court for the first time in PA because of Beta having unexcused tardys &amp; three unexcused absences. During court, the school acknowledged the fact that we turned in our requests for a 504, or IEP, three times but nothing has been done. They also acknowledged the fact that Alpha was expelled because they couldn't 'deal with him'.

Since Alpha does cyber schooling, the tests &amp; lessons are timed. Needless to say, he hasn't completed the required amount of work, and he was expelled.

Today, my wife called and said there were some people at the house &amp; I should come home. I walk in to find two State workers asking questions about Alpha &amp; Beta. I answered them, and was threatened offhandedly that if I couldn't ""make"" my child do his work, then they could. They repeated, almost as a mantra, 'if the child is disobedient'...how does Autism count as being disobedient?

The shitty thing? After relocating here, I don't have the lawyer funds....but what I really need is help &amp; resources.  Any ideas?

EDIT 1) Thanks for the positive responses! To let everyone know, we actually have three agencies working on our side for the boys education, but they mostly do family based counseling. While we are grateful for this, for the most part they are trying to teach us things we already figured out on our own.
We registered Alpha today in public school, but since Beta hasn't been treated positively, there is concern. We have tried finding a lawyer, still in the process. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/tolvd/i_need_some_help_advice_and_some_sanity/,59
1225,So we had a meltdown tonight...,"My 7yo had a meltdown tonight when we tried to go to a restaurant for Mother's Day dinner.  
We were with my wife's family and the place was so crowded that they had set up tents outside to hold the people waiting for tables. I was carrying her around outside and I could feel her getting tense with so many people around; but we played around some and she was laughing - she seemed fairly well adjusted...  
...until we tried to walk inside.  
It wasn't loud, but it was a little dark and pretty crowded - I got about 2 steps inside the foyer when she let out an ear-piercing scream (3 inches from my ear) and I had to stop and turn around and walk out.  
We went out to the sidewalk to calm down, but that wasn't happening.  
After 3 or 4 more screams and some pinching and kicking (again, while I'm holding her - she wouldn't let me put her down to talk) we decided it would be best to just skip the restaurant and head home.

I should mention here that my wife (and her whole family) is NT but I am not.  
Sometimes we differ in our reactions to these episodes - like tonight.  
If a meltdown isn't too bad, we'll often ""power through"" and get to a point where she will relax into, and usually enjoy, a new/scary/different experience. When it's bad we'll usually change the plan and find something else to do.  
Where we differ is typically in the assessment of how ""bad"" it is and ""why"".  

My wife tends to take a view that the daughter just ""doesn't want to"" and we shouldn't ""let her have her way"". That it's almost always better to ""power through"" and force her to confront her fears and deal with new experiences.  
I (and she) mean that in a much better way than it sounds.

That's what happened tonight. She said we shouldn't let her ""have her way"" but I vehemently disagreed - that this wasn't something that she was going to adjust to (crowded restaurant, new place, large-ish party with us), and it wasn't a good idea to try.  
She didn't seem like she was going to calm down very fast and I dislike making her *that* uncomfortable without a really good reason.  
I don't really care what other people think about her meltdowns and screaming but I thought it would be pretty rude to force that on a restaurant full of people trying to enjoy Mother's Day dinner - she can scream really, really loud.

My wife gave in but there was a heavy cost. She was really disappointed having to leave and cried (quietly) almost all the way home.  
The daughter thought she ruined Mother's Day for everybody and I think my wife is blaming both of us.  

My daughter even had the idea of having a ""restaurant"" at home and wanted to make menu's and everything. I told my wife I'd make her anything she wanted for dinner and we'd have a great time.  
She just cried and told us she wasn't hungry - then suggested I take the girl out for dinner someplace alone.

I'm heartbroken now. I feel like I failed my family on Mother's Day.

My wife won't talk to me; she's doing that stupid act where she pretends everything is fine.  
Sorry for the downer post, not really looking for advice; just wanted to rant.

**TL;DR: I think we screwed up Mother's Day and I'm sad. Sometimes this shit sucks (self-post; no karma)**

*EDIT/UPDATE: Well, wife really was pissed and thinks I handled it wrong.  
This morning she said she wasn't mad anymore and that just made it worse for me.  
I understand that she was disappointed but I don't think she has any cause to be ""mad"" about it.  
Now I'm more upset because I feel bad that the night was ruined and she was disappointed but I really think she's wrong and I have to advocate for my daughter - if it was just me, then I'd just let it go.  
So now she's stomped all over my triggers and I'm essentially non-functional today.

1231,A Lion's Heart,"Was stuck in traffic once in Denver on Speer avenue downtown. It's a major thoroughfare divided by a lovely little river with green hills on each side. As I waited for the light I watched a homeless man carrying a medium size rock. He was young, in his twenties, but had obviously had a rough time of things. He was dirty and wearing thread-bear clothes. I was wondering what he was going to do with the rock. Eventually he threw it off the side of one of the hills, apparently just to watch it splash. But, as the rock hit the water, I saw him display the tell-tale hand-flapping of an excited autistic person. 

I was floored. The light turned green and, in stunned silence, I drove away. I think about this man often, and whenever I look at my son (who is autistic), I feel the burning responsibility to make sure he never meets that fate - being homeless and alone. I also regret my inability to act quick enough to do something (although I still don't know what) to help this man. 

Anyway, for whatever reason, this song always makes me think of that man. And about autism in general. Thought I'd share.

I was well aware of the fact that my dad researched Autism and things of that nature, but I never really knew what he *did*. Well today I got in an argument with someone about the vaccine/autism issue. I said there was no correlation, blah blah, all that, but I actually made some intelligent-sounding points and didn't just repeat what I've read on Wikipedia verbatim. 

Later, to make sure I hadn't just BSed my entire argument, I was doing a little bit of research. I found a few articles about Andrew Wakefield (I was already familiar with the name and had a broad idea of who he was) and found my dad's name in there. Turns out, he is really good friends with Wakefield and was/is on his team of researchers.

To clarify, he's not one of the crazies who would go to the ends of the earth to justify everything Wakefield has said/done.

1238,Walls are closing in. Need help,"This is a lot of info. Please bare with me. I need help and I have no one to turn to.

I am an adult dealing with a crisis but I also have a life time of trauma. I was raped at 16 and then again at 18 by two different men. I've endured social ridicule my whole life and have been teased and taunted as a child. I recently found out 3 years ago that I am autistic which explains my social awkwardness and why people treated me bad. My father died when I finished my BA in pre-med (I am autistic but have a very high IQ) and I had to take on the role of care taker for my sick mother and little sister. I never had the chance to go to medical school. 

I skipped from job to job (before my autism diagnosis) because my managers stated that the other women in the office ""didn't like me"". I then lost my career and had to start waiting tables in order to pay bills. I worked 3 jobs at a time but always had issues with customers and so I had to leave that career behind too. I eventually had to leave my mother and sister to care for themselves because my life had started to fall apart. They blamed me for a long time for leaving them.

Right when I moved out on my own I was in an accident and injured both knees and ankles and my right hip. I used all of my savings 3 years ago for surgery but now live with chronic debilitating pain and an unable to exercise, which used to help keep depression at bay. I was mugged at knife point shortly after my physical injuries. I am still rather young, and all of these things have happened almost back to back.

Because of my life experiences, and lack of social support (I don't have friends and am incapable of maintaining friendships of my Autism) I have developed severe PTSD. I am currently living with the current diagnosis of Autism, severe PTSD, severe depression, OCD, ADD and generalized panic disorder. 

I have tried reaching out to people that were my friends when I was younger. I have tried explaining to them that I am Autistic and that I am doing the best I can do but my previous employers and many of my old friends tell me to stop making excuses for my bad behavior. 

Last november I was diagnosed with cancer. My original doctor mishandled my treatment plan and now I'm getting worse. I have no emotional strength left. I am unemployed and have no support. When I was younger I was so strong. I looked at every challenge with the belief that I would survive and thrive. With every trauma that has happened to me (and I've had a lot I am not even mentioning in this post) I've lost strength. 

I feel like I have nothing left. I am exhausted and there is no system to take care of me now that I can no longer care for myself. I've looked into long term psychiatric hospitals but it seems you need to be wealthy to attend them and they're all out of state for me anyway. I don't know what to do.

1239,Parents Rage...,"I can't show how angry I am in front of my son.  He can't see how much this hurts me so I'm doing it here, sorry.

David is 10 and is one of the lights of my life.  When he was in second grade he was evaluated for speech therapy and slipping grades.  Over the last few years we've seen autism curb his growth more and more...

Public school hasn't provided what he needs so my wife has stopped working and is a stay at home - home school teacher for him now.  She works so hard.  The time and attention has really allowed David to soar and he's working at grade level despite his disadvantages.

He is so sweet, so loving, a pure innocent wonderful boy.  He works so hard.  He gets so frustrated.  It's so hard to watch him struggle but I'm so proud of how much he has managed to accomplish.

He's akward, he's difficult to understand.  He's tall for his age and while very functional he is obviously different when observed with a group.

Last night I picked him up from soccer practice.  As he came walking across the field I could see his eyes were red and he was crying.

""What's wrong buddy?""

""They were making fun of me, even the girls.""

""Oh sweetie, I'm sorry...""

""I was telling them to stop teasing me, I was telling them I have autism but they couldn't understand me because I was crying...""

""Come here buddy."" &lt;hugs&gt; ""I'm sorry they were being mean to you.""

""Coach made them stop.  He told them what autism is.  He told themI have it.""

""Yeah, because you were crying and you couldn't?""

""Yeah.""

""Well, maybe they won't be so quick to tease you next time.  You know there's nothing ""wrong"" with you David.  Autism just means you're not wired the same way as everyone else, you're just different, not worse, not better.""

""I know, but they still make fun of me...""

""Sweetie, they are kids and they don't understand.  When kids don't understand something, or it's different they make fun of it, I wish it wasn't that way.""

""Yeah...they say I'm dumb and they call me stupid.""

""You know that's not true, all they are doing is showing you how stupid *they* are by saying that kind of thing.  You're very smart.  All kinds of people have autism.  Doctors, laywers, software developers, fire fighters - being different doesn't mean your dumb.  They're wrong.""

""Will I have autism when I grow up?""

(my heart collapses into a cold ball as hard and dense as a singularity in the center of a black hole.  I manage to keep the quaver from my voice and the tears from my eyes)

""Yes sweetie.  It's not something that goes away.  But!  As you grow up we're going to teach you to cope with it.  We're going to help you understand it.  So long as you keep working hard you'll be just fine, autism or no autism.  Most people don't have to do all this extra work, they have it easy, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.  Mom and I will be here to help though, I promise.""

""Yeah...""



It's hard being an autism parent.  As I talk to and comfort my son this way I'm watching the other kids running across the field, getting picked up by their parents.

This is the part you're going to hate me for.

There's this one little girl - Sarah on David's soccer team.  I've seen her tease him.  I've heard her say cruel things.  I've seen David blow her off and go on about the game having fun.

I've seen the way she skips across the field, fluid and confident.  She has grace and mind that runs like a finely tuned machine and no conscience or humility at all.

Compared to my lumbering, shuffeling, mumbling boy with such a sweet pure heart and some bad wiring/programming that traps him like a prisoner in his own body.

And I wish and I hope and I pray that Sarah's children have autism.

I want her to spend the first 20-30 years of her care free life in cheerleading, playing soccer, getting good grades and being popular.  She'll go to a good school and get a good education.  She'll start a good career and meet a nice husband.  She'll have a beautiful baby, she'll have everything in the world...until she gets a note from the teacher in second grade.

I want her broke because she can't work and has to care for her children.  I want her tired from working two jobs so her husband can stay home and takre care of them.  I want her to have to spoon feed her child EVERY SINGLE FUCKING BITE OF THEIR FOOD FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIFE UNTIL THE DAY SHE DIES!  I WANT TO HEAR THE CRACK AS THE STONE OF HER HEART SHATTERS WHEN SOME LITTLE BITCH CALLS HER CHILD A FREAK.  I WANT HER TO FEEL THE BLACK HOLE IN HER HEART WHEN HER CHILD ASKS HER IF THEY WILL HAVE AUTISM WHEN THEY GROW UP.

I'm sorry.

It seems that it's pretty common for people (AS and NT alike) to wear headphones when they don't want to be bothered. Unfortunately this is not foolproof as people still try and start conversations.

This is where my idea comes in. I think it would be cool if there was something a person could slip over their headphones to let everyone else know they want to be left alone. There could be little phrases on these covers that say things like ""If I wanted to talk to you I'd say hello"" or ""bug off"" or ""I can't hear you"" or any number of other phrases. 

I don't think it would be that hard to make one cover that fit most over the ear headphones, although I don't see away to make it work for earbuds.

1246,Any families here with an autistic family member in college?,"As tough as it was growing up with an autistic little brother, he's done so much for me and my family to make us proud.  

My little brother has high-functioning autism.  He's astonishingly intelligent, but will never hold a conversation unless you prompt it, and his answers will rarely be anything other than ""yes"" or ""no"".  Growing up, it was unclear whether or not he would be able to attend college due to his condition.  It wasn't until high school that we realized that he was doing well enough in his classes to shake the special circumstances that were prescribed by his IP meetings throughout his younger years to the point where he only needed tutoring in English and needed to see a speech therapist once a month.

Now, I understand that the choice to send an autistic child to a secondary school can be difficult.  Even if their education is successful, will they be able to adapt to a social setting in their job environment and do well?  Will it be a waste of money if the child isn't able to hold a job?  It's a particularly stressful choice, but here's where my brother's story comes in.

My little brother has always been fascinated with music.  Even though he expressed his creativity with toys such as K'nex or Legos, as soon as music would come on he'd zone completely into it, absorb and memorize it all, and would hum it to himself for the rest of the day.  His favorites were classical and orchestral pieces, but he'd do the same thing with pop hits or classic rock.  It didn't matter what kind of music it was as long as there was music in his life.  He wouldn't be the same person without it.

As interested as he was in music, he never seemed to want to emulate it beyond memorization.  He never picked up the piano, and he never wrote his own.  It wasn't until high school that we realized how well he had actually understood what he was listening to.  My brother never expressed it outright, but we found out that he had self-taught himself music theory and knew, through reading, how to play multiple instruments and could read anything you put in front of him.  Interestingly enough, he decided that his favorite kinds of instruments were percussion and began to dedicate himself to learning more about them.  Throughout high school it was clear that he wasn't just outperforming the other students in the band, but was on an entirely different level with his music.

He went on to place well his entire high school career in the all-state high school bands, a collection of some of the best talent in the state.  It was clear that his forte (bad pun) was in music, which made my parents' choice even more difficult whether or not to send him to a secondary school for music.  Careers in music are not known to pay well, and my little brother lacked the interpersonal skills to teach.  My parents thought about having him study something more ""appropriate"", but when asked, my little brother always responded that he wanted to study music.

Our decision was made for us when a professor of music met my little brother after a performance.  This professor was the head of the percussion department at his university and actively plays in multiple symphonies in the area.  This professor had been watching my little brother play throughout the years and offered him a very good scholarship into his program at the university.

Since he's been there, my little brother's personality has blossomed and he's become a more social person since he enjoys his environment.  He couldn't be happier pursuing what he loves.

___

I guess my moral here is to identify what shines through in your family members' talents and support it.  Don't let anyone make that decision for your autistic son or daughter - my little brother had actually gotten kicked out of the elementary music program, and look where he is now!  I'd love to hear some more success stories from you guys.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/srzik/any_families_here_with_an_autistic_family_member/,851
1247,"I'm constantly filled with regret and guilt over how 
I treated my autistic brother in childhood and 
don't know how to get past it. ","I am 23, my brother is 21. He is ""high functioning"" in that he can work a low-skill job and answer questions, but he cannot coordinate his own transportation, pay bills, initiate conversations (except rarely with immediately family). 

A couple days ago there was a conversation at my house, where my mom brought up an anecdote from my brother's childhood -- where he ripped all the tags off a collection of beanie babies for no apparent reason, when he was 6 years old. He piped up and said that he did it because he thought the plastic loop holding the tags on was hurting the animals - and he didn't know they weren't real at the time. 

He'd never shared this before. The fact that he had such a clear memory from so long ago triggered something in me. Beyond the... infinite compassion that that particular idea embodied. 

Since then I have been CONSTANTLY thinking of what an incredibly awful brother I had been for the majority of my life. I would never let him play with me and my friends, because I thought he was ""weird."" I would always try my hardest to crush him at video games, because I didn't want to ""compromise the integrity of the game"" -- even though losing over and over made him very mad and upset, and just one or two wins in there could have made him extremely happy. He would routinely eat more than his ""fair share"" whenever we ordered pizza, and I would make a HUGE deal out of how he got more pieces than me -- even though I didn't really need more than what I ate. I just thought it was ""unfair."" Even though food is one of the FEW things that he gets to fully enjoy. I still tried to take that away from him. 

My parents tried on several occasions to get me to go to sibling workshops, to spend time figuring it out and learning how to cope. But I always refused. I just flat out refused any interaction.

For several years in adolescence I barely acknowledged him on a daily basis, despite living in the same house.

I vividly remember one episode when I was around 8. A friend was over, and for some reason, I thought it would be a great idea to take a deck of cards, throw it up in the air, and tell my mom that my brother did it. It was all my idea, and I had no reason to be so cruel. He was admonished for it, and I can't stop thinking, I just CAN'T stop thinking -- he must remember this. I was a stupid kid, I was an awful brother, but his amazing memory must still be encoded with the way I treated him forever. 

I like to think that now I'm a good brother. I go out of my way to make conversation with him every time I'm over there, I send him messages on facebook and start conversations there, I never yell at him or admonish him or treat him as inferior in any way, ever. I bring him random gifts that are perfect for the few interests he has.

But that's only the last couple years, and I feel like I could never overcome how I treated him for almost his whole life. I'm an awful brother, and I've practically cried myself to sleep the last few nights knowing that I did this. What would his development have been like if I was a good brother? What would his life be like now with our family? What would it be like to actually have a RELATIONSHIP with my only sibling? 

I hate myself. How can I possibly cope with this? ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/srdqz/im_constantly_filled_with_regret_and_guilt_over/,852
1248,Hey r/autism! My work has asked me to write a blog post about autism. Can I get a fact check?,"The purpose of the blog post is to have a short, educational overview of autism in honor of Autism Awareness Month. Since I didn't know much about autism until I started doing research a couple of days ago, I'm a little nervous about just posting this online without getting input from someone who actually knows something about the disorder. I'm still tightening up the language a bit, but right now the text (minus the intro and conclusion) is as follows:

""At its base, autism is a series of related neurological disorders that impair their sufferer’s ability to communicate with other people.  Every individual with autism experiences it differently, but some symptoms are common to most of them.  People with autism might have a hard time making eye contact, interpreting or creating interpretable body language, and developing language skills.  In fact, as many as 40% of autistic people may never learn to speak at all.  They also tend to demand a certain amount of inelasticity from their surroundings.  This can manifest in several ways.
  They may be highly uncomfortable going new places, or they may fixate on a limited number of foods and refuse to eat anything else.  Many have a restricted number of interests that they focus on intensely.  For many autistic people, routine and consistency are not just crutches, they are necessary for their mental well-being.  
Initially symptoms begin to show somewhere between 6 months and 3 years of age, and often manifest themselves by seeming to slow an autistic child’s cognitive development.  While some autistic children do develop more slowly mentally, this is not the case for all sufferers.  In fact, on non-linguistic intelligence tests, some groups rank in the normal to high range for intelligence.  The problem is, it doesn’t matter how capable your brain is of learning math or music or what have you if you have a hard time understanding the person who is trying to teach it to you.  
How autism effects an individual as they age depends on the severity of their condition.  Autism is officially referred to as “autism spectrum disorder” because the disease can strike with so many varying levels of severity.  On one end of the spectrum lay those with Asperger’s Syndrome and other high-functioning forms of autism.  People at this level often have no impairment on their language or cognitive development, and only suffer from impairments to their ability to interact socially and a general restriction in interests.  At the other end of the spectrum lie those with conditions like Rhett Syndrome, which not only impairs its sufferer’s ability to communicate, but so sharply impairs their cognitive development that they require occupational therapy to learn simple dress, such as how bathe and dress on their own.  Those who fall into the higher end of the autistic spectrum can grow up to be productive members of society, while those towards the lower end may require constant care for their entire lives.""

1250,Going to volunteer at a school for children with autism - any important things to know?,"I'm going to volunteer with a school for children with autism. I have previously worked with a group called PALS, a group for adults with severe disabilities where we did songs and dances with them, and did performances a few times a year. It was one of the best experiences of my life - those people were just so full of love and kindness.

I was just wondering if anyone had any tips for dealing with kids with autism in particular for me. I want to do the best I can for these kids and hopefully give them a role model.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/sq7k4/going_to_volunteer_at_a_school_for_children_with/,854

1252,Just found my way here and been reading a lot of posts.  I wanted to share my tale with people who understand.,"I'm not a parent or personally afflicted with the condition, but I am a sister to two brothers--one with high functioning Asperger's and one with moderate to severe autism.  Being the oldest, I watched my parents (sometimes helplessly) go through many a dark time with my brothers.  First, with my eldest younger brother ""M"", trying to find him behavioral therapists, tutors, etc. anything which would help him excel up to the level of the other kids his age.  Nothing seemed to work and entering our local public school only served to throw gas on the fire. His social difficulties resulted in frustration on the part of his grade school teachers as well as bullying from kids who had likely never heard of Asperger's and only saw him as the weird quiet kid on the playground.  Constant fighting with his teachers and pleas to not force him to go to school anymore took more of an emotional toll on my parents than I could appreciate at the time, as I was only a child myself.

Things only got darker as my next brother ""R"" was failing to speak even  into his toddler years.  My parents feared for the worst, and one doctor visit after another failed to yield any answers.  Finally, after years of no answer other than ""a behavioral issue"", the word autism came into the conversation.  At the time, my parents knew nothing about autism or that it was related to Asperger's syndrome so all of this was a great shock to them.  For everything they went through with M, the same issues would arise with R but with about 10 times the frequency and severity.  It was difficult to take him into public because he had a great fear of birds which would send him into a panic attack if one flew by in the sky.  He was antsy in restaurants which would result in all of us bolting down our food before he started to scream.  R would only allow my parents to bathe him with cold water because warm/hot water or the any use of the shower head would send him into a fit.  Coupled with the frustration of his non-verbal nature well into his grade school years as well as financial troubles on the part of my parents, and there were a lot of times where I felt like stuff ""normal kids"" worried about were the last things on my mind.  

Finally a breakthrough came when we made our move to a larger house and a new school.  This school, unlike our last which was in an extremely poor neighborhood, had a special education program. Now suddenly instead of M fearing school, he could work in peace at his own pace and R could learn to speak with us instead of our attempts to communicate with him in broken improvised hand signs.  Suddenly, the sun seemed to break through all of the dark clouds hanging over our family.  My brothers were smiling and laughing, all of us were smiling and laughing again.  From there the progress has continued to be upward. 

M is in college now and works successfully at his part-time job.

R recently graduated high school and has recently found his life's joy in athletics.  He is a frequent competitor (and medalist) at Special Olympics in swimming and plays baseball in a local low-stress no-rules league for handicapped and mentally challenged kids and teens.  He is now nearly fully conversational-- can easily understand most questions and requests and is starting to understand humor and laugh at things on TV or in conversation that we would perceive as funny.  If he doesn't understand the language you're using, if you are able to show him the object and match it with the word, he will almost always remember it.  He's better at video games than any other kid I've ever met in my life, and he's been cleaning my clock ever since we were little.  I've always believed that he can see patterns in games that other people may gloss over. He loves toy trucks, trains, cats, dogs, playing outside, cooking, all kinds of stuff.  He loves the smallest things in life that may seem menial to others, and I wish I could be more like him in that regard.

I'm proud that they're my brothers.  They are my brothers and always have been, no matter what kind of hand they were dealt by their DNA.

I'm definitely not looking for validation or pity or any sort of reaction from my wall-o-text, nor do I think my story means that there's a happy ending imminent for everyone.  I just want to say that no matter how dark it may seem or hopeless, it's never the answer to give up.  Children with autism are just like children without autism, both need love, compassion, support, validation, comfort, understanding...just a little bit more than your average kid.  There's a few more layers to crack in their shells but once you get there, the reward is priceless.  Even if they can't physically tell you they appreciate it... they do.  To see my brothers laugh and enjoy life after all the suffering and hardship really puts things into perspective for me. I'm about to graduate from college in less than a week and one of the biggest rewards for me isn't the diploma, the jobs, the graduate schools... it's the fact that my brothers can be there to enjoy my success exactly the same as I have enjoyed theirs.

1253,"r/Autism, What are your views regarding the mentally ill and sex?","Dear Reddit,


I am a 19 year old male with two older brothers. The oldest is 28, and is autistic. He is truly a gem in our family, and we all love him in our own special way. He lives in a group-home with other autistic people (with counselors, a job, extra-curriculars, all that jazz). It is a good place for him. 

Jeremy is fairly high functioning. He can walk around town independently, pay for his own things, and has a great comprehension of english (he does not know higher-level vocab, but it is sufficient). 


He is obsessed with pornography. I do not think this is uncommon - afterall, he is a 28 year old male. He has always expressed that he is lonely, and wants to find a girlfriend/wife of his own. This is obviously difficult, and you can see the pain on his face when myself or my other brother have a girl over. 


Has anybody here dealt with the issue of a need to express sexuality? Do parents turn a blind eye to it? Has anybody ever considered hookers, or other services to help? I look forward to any advice given. 

Edit: Let me give more details of Jeremy. He has extreme social anxiety. He does not really have any friends that he could call and have a conversation with, save the family. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/spgg7/rautism_what_are_your_views_regarding_the/,856

For me, it had a really resounding message, and I want to share that with everyone.

* We have all the information for the presentation ready, but we don't have many quick selling points to advertise and grab people's attention on the flyer. So any quick stats/facts, besides it's growing rate? 
I don't intend to degrade people with Autism by asking for ""selling points"", but as someone who used to be unaware of the situation society is in in relation to Autism, it was easy for me to shrug it off, so I would like to apologize in advance.

1263,My 5yr old Autistic nephew,"Words can't express how much I love this kid! Words can't describe how fortunate I am to have him in my life. I just wish I could talk to him.. :/


His name is Landon :) and here's kind of whats gone on since he's was born.

Landon's Mom was in denial about him being autistic. Didn't take him to get diagnosed even though it was clear as day that he was. Didn't enroll him into speech classes or any special treatment classes like she should have. He's now five years old and says very limited words. He knows some words used for manners, cars, super heroes and criminals (batman, joker, penguin etc.). 
And now he gets very discouraged when interacting with kids his age because they know so much more than him from what I interpret.

My name is Ricky, and I'm his favorite uncle, possibly his favorite person. Let me tell you, this kid is awesome. Everytime I see him, his face just lights up, and he goes crazy jumping around and repeating ""Uncle Ricky"" over and over ""echo"". He hugs me all the time, always wants to play with just me, always wants to know where I am. I take his autism as a blessing in most cases.

The rest of my family just says; ""Awww, poor Landon,"" ""Poor, guy."" And I know Landon can hear thm and get an understanding of what they mean. So I get upset when they say that around him and tell them to stop saying that, and take him for what he is and do what we can for him. 

My main question is, will I ever be able to talk to my best friend? I love this kid to death and I just want to hold a conversation with him, and really understand him. I'd like to say I'm pretty damn good with communicating with body language to him, and simple words.

Should we keep him away from kids that are more knowledgeable than him? He get visibly saddened by them and starts tugging on my shirt to hold him when they're near.

And what is the best way to explain to my family to have them stop saying ""poor guy"" and such? I try to tell them he's a smart kid and that as long as we find something he likes doing, he'll be just as happy as any other living person.. yet it still gets repeated.


Btw some of the things he does and I have not educated myself about, I just know its common.
Covers his ears
Flaps his hands
And echos words

When he covers his ears I just take his hands off slowly and tell him everything's ok.. I don't even know if thats the right thing to do for him.


This may not be very structured, but it's whats on my mind. :)

The father has another son that is autistic so she has always been concerned that our son might be as well.  The doctor said that our son definitely displays behaviors of an autistic child.  He will be going back to the doctor in a month and then will be referred to the children's hospital here in town to be placed on the spectrum.... two hours ago I didn't even know what that meant.

Videos can be sent to me in any format (I'll figure it out and convert them), and if they are small enough feel free to send them directly to autismvids2012@gmail.com  -- if they are too large, uploading them to YOUTUBE would be greatly appreciated.

The videos will not be sold off or sold of any kind. This is solely for educational purposes!

Basically it's a series of small, laminated flash cards that have velcro on the back. There is a separate laminated strip of paper that the flash cards attach to in a line. This way kids can see what's next and know what to expect. 


I would really appreciate some input about what pictures to put on the cards. I'm using clipart to print out pictures on a grid. Each picture is a 1.5 inch square. Then I tape the picture to a piece of construction paper and laminate it. I want to put the name of the object on the bottom on the picture. I've also decided to make the final card is a circle because the square flashcards poke you in the palms when you dig in the bag for one.


I will post a picture of the set as soon as I figure out imgur. Right now I have about 120 flashcards. The set I have finished is one I made for my son and has square cards. I started making round ones today and I'll provide pictures of those too.

Most of our family is VERY supportive. They understand that our life is difficult and that we might have to cancel plans at the last minute or that we have to have things done a specific way. 

This being said we have one family member who just does not understand at all and seems to make it his job to make us feel horrible. He is constantly bringing up everything wrong with us weather it is our children, hobbies, parenting, house you name it he can find fault with it. 

He has 3 children of his own all 3 or under and has a very supportive family on his wife's side. the thing is is i can't take his constant critisism anymore. EVERYTHING about our life is bad, whether it is the wood used in our deck or how our autistic son talks.

1277,I need some help/advice about iPads for autistic kids,"Hello fellow redditors,
I've not posted to reddit before and haven't visited this particular subreddit so I'm not sure what's already been asked a million times or not...but I'm looking for some help. Here's my story:



My cousin, Dakota, is turning 10 this year. He's autistic and incapable of talking. He can sign a few things, like yes and no and some animals but he can't learn much else beyond that.


His parents are getting a little frustrated, because he can't really talk to them. For instance, he's been having nightmares, but he's unable to tell them anything about them, or what's scaring him and it's really upsetting.


He's going to a special school for autistic kids and is doing pretty good, but as I said, when it comes to language he's pretty much as far as he can go without something extra.


In this case, the school was going to try and get him an iPad, because they think it's really his last and only hope to be able to communicate now, and later when he gets older. His parents are low income and none of us have the money to get an iPad for him. 


The school was going to go through the county to get one for him, but it seems to have completely fallen through.


So my question is, basically, how best we can get him one? The school said as long as we get one, they can get the apps and teach him how to use it, it's just a matter of getting one.


I know a lot of places now and then have donation drives to gather iPads and then take applications, but I can't find any going on right now in our area [Northeast Ohio]. Is there any websites or charities or organisations around that provide iPads in these situations I can have them apply too?


Would it be a good idea to find a money raising website, something like Kickstarter maybe where I could try and raise the money for one?


I really want to help them find a way to get one, so he can talk to us, in some fashion at least.


Thanks for taking the time to read this, and for any help you can provide.

Edit; I wanted to clarify a little bit. The iPad is most assuredly for helping him cross his language barrier, but it's also to help him learn too. His teachers want it to help him learn and grow too. I know I didn't make that too clear in my post.  Sorry &gt;_&lt;

1278,"Aunt claims her son is autistic, I am not convinced.","My cousin is now seven years old and I am really scared for his future. Until recently he was a very hyperactive, often disobedient kid, but it was very much on the same level as me when I was that age. When he was about three or four, his mom (who has absolutely no parenting skills and I attribute much of his misbehavior to this) crafted the theory that it was simply because he's autistic. What bothers me the most is how they talk openly about it in front of him and casually use it as an excuse for his behavior.

1280,Does anyone have any suggestions for some engaging activities to do with my mentee who has autism? (x-post from askreddit),"I joined a program at my university to mentor a young adult with autism. It's been really rewarding and I love it. For the fall semester, my mentee and I got along great and I saw her really open up and become so much more independent. Sadly, her parents made her quit the program (from what I can tell, they couldn't handle that she had a social life and wanted to control her). When the spring semester started, I was assigned a new mentee. She is a sweet girl but she is almost nonverbal. She talks some but it is difficult for her and hard to understand. She really likes to please though and works very hard on our assignments. Part of our mentorship duties is to do activities that are fun and not about homework.

My question is: does anyone out there work with people who have autism or are related to someone with autism and do you have any advice?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/rvuit/does_anyone_have_any_suggestions_for_some/,59

 1) Vocabulary related. 4-6th grade level. Uses pictures or animations to learn the word (for example, a picture of the word ""hoist"" will show someone ""hoisting"" an object, etc). This can be web or text form. I teach him vocabulary, but his abstract thinking skills are very low and thus make it hard for him to ""visualize"" many words. 

2) Writing related. My student is old enough to be in 8th grade, but his reading / writing skills are very low. I need to get some sort of book that will help teach him how to write basic paragraphs. Maybe it could show a picture, and have the student write a simple paragraph on the picture, and explaining very simply how to structure a paragraph, and make modest summaries. My student finds it very hard to understand what a paragraph is talking about, and finds it hard to summarize topics. 3-5th grade level. Again, this can be in text or web form. Anything would help. Preferably books with exercises so i can do it with him, but yeah anything would help. I don't have too much experience in this area (I'm a college kid myself, I just tutor/help him as my part time job) so yeah :P 


Lastly, just to clear some things up, while he is autistic, he can still perform most day to day functions perfectly on his own. He lacks mostly in social skills, abstract thinking skills, and some communication. However, he is a ""mild"" case at best and thus I can communicate with him fairly well. He is very good at memorization (I helped him memorize 100+ vocab words), but he can't UNDERSTAND what they mean. I need books that will use visuals to help him grasp the actual meaning of words. And as for paragraphs, he has poor reading / writing ability, and we need something that will help jumpstart him in a simple and clear way.

His interests are: Transformers, Magic the Gathering (card game), WoW, other computer games, Star Wars, and variety of TV shows. Again, he has amazing memorization capabilities (he will constantly memorize entire segments from certain movies when his mind is wandering off), but he doesn't really understand them.

Thanks in advance for the help, and if any additional information is needed, I will be more than happy to provide it. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/rpthb/i_tutor_an_autistic_kid_any_advice_on_what_books/,872

(of course we have fears about her condition too, but that's a whole different story) . what i'd like to know is are there any autistic people out there who could tell me how they remember their first years at school ( through their memories or that of their parents ) , how it helped them develop, what we can do as parents to prepare them better to what's coming... we believe that even though he does seem a bit late in some aspects of his development, him being in a learning environment can only cause improvement to his condition. are we wrong? is he going to be 'eaten alive' out there? all comments are welcome, as it is so difficult to fully comprehend how exactly being autistic affects a little boy growing up.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/rm5lt/just_found_out_some_months_ago_that_our_4_year/,285

When at university i was researching a multisensory environment for children with autism for my final project. It was something i was so interested in and when coming to talk about the designs for these rooms i met a lady with autism and a fellow worker at the centre which is to support students mainly with disability or mental health problems, we got chatting had a couple of similar sessions and she was very helpful. The thing that took me back that after the 2 meetings we ended up talking and asked me a few questions, she reccomended i take a test for autism and her co worker agreed. 


nearly a year later my mother some reason  took an online test that recorded 75%, and she mentioned it today. It sort of took me aback, i rembered about that meeting, i sort of had a sinking feeling. I learnt alot about autism in my final project, it is likely its hereditary so i was sort of speechless, my mother wondered why i was a tad akward but for me it just reminded me of that conversation. 

From the research i read we i do see parallels which we meet my mums and i tendencies.

1293,Knowing what to expect. What has your experience been..? How do we put our daughter's ability/disability in context?,"My daughter was severely jaundiced at birth and the community hospital we took her to was laissez faire about it. Even though severe jaundice can cause brain damage, we were told jaundice was no big deal (she was in the 95th percentile for brain damage risk for many, many hours without treatment, we later found out.) Even her pediatrician at the time wasn't overly concerned when we called her up and told her that our baby was COMATOSE and wouldn't wake or feed. We took her to the ER after hanging up the phone, where they put us in a room and ignored her for two hours...

ANYWAY

Izzy is now 2 and a half. She's finally talking, although with a severe speech impediment. Her diagnosis is autism. A year ago, she had an almost entirely flat affect, which as her parents, we didn't really see (but do now). To us, she was sweet, affectionate, and seemed content even though we did worry about her speech and her eye contact. It's night and day now. She smiles, she laughs, she hugs and kisses and waves and loves.

But she never gets happily excited. Surprise her with her favorite thing, a giant helium butterfly balloon, and she'll point and say ""Butterfly balloon. I like butterfly balloon!"" but there's no gasp, no jaw drop, none of the exaggerated, melodramatic excitement that you normally see from a little girl (or boy) around her age.

How far have we come? How far have we to go? Her therapists aren't willing to tell us where she sits, relative to other children both autistic and ""normal"". Is this because they can't, or they won't?

How do we find out? How do we predict what she may be like at 5? 6? 14?

We're getting services, she's receiving speech therapy, ABA therapy, and her therapists are preparing to advocate for her transition to preschool with our municipal school system, but we're told she may not qualify because she's so high functioning. Compared to who? A kid in a wheelchair who communicates in croaks and groans? A totally normal, healthy 3 year old? Something in between? ""High functioning"" really is meaningless.

I am asking this subreddit for any information that is true to form, to not insult or to spread misinformation.  

The inspiration that I had for this story has to deal with people who are not considered as the same as others; not considered ""normal.""  The basic plot is that there is a mother who cares for her son with autism.  She is very sick (I am on the fence as to what she may have) and wants to find someone to watch over her son; a person to take care of him then possibly to start a friendship.  The girl who answers her ad is a young pregnant teen who has no one else to rely on and is willing to help them.  These characters find solace with each other; a group of people who are unlikely people who understand each other.

Again, if anyone is offend or put off by this request please let me know.  It is not my intention to do so; I will delete this post if anyone is offended.

(Jan 2012)","From [Hominins and the Emergence of the Modern Human Brain](http://www.scribd.com/doc/79970775/) (page 3):

&gt; Autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction for which a clinical definition is ongoing. is referenced in studies of fossil hominin brain structure and function, either as an analogy for developmental differences between closely related species or as a potentially [atavistic](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atavistic) indication of actual primitive phenotypes. For example, an autistic child lacking language created naturalistic artwork much like that from the Upper Paleolithic, on the basis of which it was suggested that fAMHS could have also lacked fully modern cognition (Humphrey. 1998).

---

Note: Some of our immediate ancestors had brains that were, on average, bigger than our own.  However, modern humans have a much greater range of variation, which might indicate a partial retention of ancestral phenotypes in the general populaton.  [Lord Byron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron) (*She Walks in Beauty*) had an enormous head (2200cc), and his daughter [wrote the first computer program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#First_computer_program) **in the Victorian era**.  Clearly ""atavistic"" does not necessarily mean ""worse"" (but probably does mean ""[different](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/)"" to some extent).

1304,Our diagnosed autistic daughter barely displays any autistic traits after 5 months of ABA.,"Was she misdiagnosed, or is ABA just super-effective? I think she has always been an edge case. In fact, we didn't believe the diagnosis and thought everyone was nuts. We were convinced she had mild brain damage from badly treated jaundice as a newborn (maybe she did).

Our little one has gone from an almost entirely flat affect, with only periodic affection and a very rare smile, almost no eye contact, very little socialization, etc, to being pretty much a totally ""normal"" 2 and a half year old who laughs like crazy, smiles when we smile at her, plays normally with toys and with peers, and basically, is ""just a kid"" now. In fact, we now understand why she had the autism diagnosis in the first place. She's SO different, like a different person entirely.

What happened? 

I have a pet theory that she really DID have some wires crossed/cut from the under-treated jaundice and, the infant/toddler brain being very plastic, has worked around whatever it was, but that's just me speculating with very little knowledge to base it on.

1309,What We Use To Get Through Unfinished School Work With Minimal Meltdowns. ,"My little Autistic 2nd grader is having a tough time focusing in school while we get his meds straightened out. This means a backlog of unfinished school work that we have to work on in the evenings and lots of screaming and crying because he doesn't want to do it. If I turn this album on for him, he'll sit and work as long as his tiny attention span will allow and we finally have some productive time. My son got to meet him a few months ago, and it was a momentous occasion for him. Trevor spent some personal time with him and played with him a bit...it was an amazing night for my son. 

I know what works for us won't work for everyone, but maybe it will help someone out there who is experiencing what we are.

1310,Volunteer Group Traveling to India and Nepal to Provide Autism Training. Are You Interested in Following A Video Blog? [x-post from /r/rwb],"My name is Christopher Flint, President and Founder of AACTION Autism (www.aactionautism.org). We are committed to providing autism training and support to vulnerable areas across the globe. In places where autism is mostly unrecognized and undiagnosed, the consequences for families and children with autism are severe. Mothers are routinely blamed for their children's autism. Families are shunned by their community. In worst case scenarios, children with autism are hacked, drowned, and maimed - losing the potential to lead productive, happy lives.

We raise money through donations and small fundraisers. Because we are working with areas that have very little financial resources, we raise all the funds so they do not have to pay a penny for our training. Our team members take vacation time from their jobs in the states to volunteer their time and expertise.

We are returning to India and Nepal from March 8th to March 25th. We would be happy to take video of our work, testimonials from parents, life in India, and whatever else you would like to know if there is interest. Sometimes internet access can be spotty so putting a video blog like this together can be tricky, but it is an important story to share. Please let me know and thank you for taking the time to read this post!

Edit 1: Thank you all for your support and suggestions! We are definitely going to do our best to get the blog going - we will update you when we are on the ground and ready to go! If you are interested in supporting our work you can donate securely here:

The fact of the matter is though, that we need a significant number of people to show their interest before we can get further than we have already worked - we need to know what activities, talks and discussion groups you want us to run, as well as what fun events you want us to plan.

So, to get the number of autistics that we need to show interest, we need your help - we need you to send this around the autistics you know (we are sorry if this ends up in your email box a few times!), pass it around groups and post it on forums.

After all, it's time that we autistics started doing it for ourselves!

So, please fill out the form at http://bit.ly/autconf and pass it on!

Of course I'm devastated about my daughter and worry for her future but I've had three years to fall in love with her.  She's the same kid I loved before we got this diagnosis, we have just have a label now for this behavior and a lot more challenges ahead than we anticipated.

But I don't even know my second daughter yet.  And it's not like as soon as she's born we'll be able to tell.  I'm terrified I'm going to spend all my time analyzing everything she does and not be able to bond with her at all.

I have tried meal plans, but I tend to not want what is on the plan on the particular day. It's odd, one day I'll be craving something, the next day the very idea of it is abhorrent.

I am fortunate that I have a 24 hour supermarket nearby, so if I decide I want something I can usually get it, but it often takes me hours to work out what I do want. This is leading to me eating usually once a day.

1317,I just found out my brother was diagnosed with Autism.,"I'm a female 21-year-old college student, and my brother's 20.

Growing up it was pretty obvious that there was something different about my brother, but I always just thought he had pretty extreme social anxiety.  He hasn't really had friends since middle school, and he's always been really lazy with school even though he's pretty smart.

I always thought he had more potential than he gave himself credit for, so I tried to push him to work harder.  For example, I found out two days before his college applications were due that he hadn't really started them.  I started out by gently encouraging him, but ended up yelling at him a few hours before his deadline.  I guess it worked though-- he made it on time, and got into a few colleges (though he dropped out a few months after starting).  Clearly he's a fairly mild case, but my parents are amazed that he made it through any college at all.  Apparently his therapists have recommended sending him to a permanent living facility, but my dad's unwilling to do that which I'm glad about.

Anyway, I treated him like this before I knew he was autistic.  I think I pushed him a little too hard a couple months ago (he was refusing to get in the car to go out to dinner with me and my dad), and my dad finally told me that he's been in therapy for years and his diagnosis once we were alone.

I'm glad my parents didn't tell me when I was growing up, since I feel like I might have treated him differently or even used it against him in a moment of teenage spite.  Now that I'm older, obviously that's not something I would do.

I've been trying to treat him the same, only now I never yell at him about anything.  I decided to completely let my dad dole out any advice/discipline.  If he starts being difficult I just let it be, and try to be as nice as possible.  I really have no idea what I'm supposed to do in this situation, though.  Any advice?

1318,ABA Training Recommendations,"I'm new to this subreddit- brand new, actually, my 3 yr old daughter was diagnosed yesterday as high functioning autistic.  My husband and I are still working through the initial emotions- our daughter is very verbal (though not at all conversational) so this totally shocked us, we knew she wasn't like ""normal"" kids but this wasn't what we were expecting to hear; we had a very stereotypical idea of what autism is.  But when the doctor outlined all the behaviors she was seeing just in the initial interview, it became obvious we were just overlooking it all.

The psychologist was incredibly helpful in outlining our next steps so we're trying to focus on that.  One of her recommendations was getting my sister (who is our in home nanny) trained in ABA therapy so my daughter can get full time intensive help at home in addition to all the other therapies/programs we're looking into.  I've been looking around online and it's hard to tell what's a scam and what's legit.

The position I interviewed for is as a behavioral aide. From what I can tell, it mostly involves being one-on-one with an autistic child throughout his or her day at the school, and assisting in the event of any meltdowns or violent/self-injuring behaviors. While I have a B.S. in Psychology, I've never worked autistic individuals before, so I'm not really sure what to expect. I've gone through one day of shadowing, and watched one boy in particular who would bite and scratch himself or others, and bang his head up against the wall. What's going on inside his head when he's engaging in these behaviors? Is he getting overstimulated or trying to communicate something?

By ""limited job skills"" I mean that moving things from one place to another or doing laundry is about as complex of a task as can be performed, even with a job coach.  But that the job coach can certainly do more complicated ASPECTS of the job (sign a dog out to be walked, set-up the leash.)

I work for an organization that tries to find jobs for individuals that exhibit these behaviors but we've been having trouble finding good job sites.  The two most awesome job sites we've been able to find are:

1 - walking dogs at an animal shelter - the young adults I work for LOVED working here, but eventually one of us pulled the fire alarm and we were asked to leave.

2 - harvesting crops at a community farm - while this was a great fit for my client's skills, the young adults did NOT like working here and so we stopped going.

Neither of these job sites would have occurred to me, and so it got me thinking that perhaps there are more out there that haven't occurred to me.  Oh, and this is for individuals with autism who CAN NOT express their needs/wants verbally.  (We've found awesome jobs for those who can.)  It's more of a trial-and-error procedure - the animal shelter was a success (until we got kicked out), the garden a failure (because it wasn't fun), and we're not sure where to go from here.  A lot of places simply won't allow someone who is self-injuring or hitting their staff to work there (there is no threat to the employers or customers).

I need help, fellow redditors. She is struggling with her son's educational program and I am hoping you all can provide your experience, strength and hope. She is unfamiliar with reddit so I created this thread and sent her a link so she can provide all of the specifics.

Overview (to the best of my understanding): He is high-functioning, very bright and in public kindergarden.  He has different sensory needs than the other children. He is being treated as disruptive.  for example, yesterday he was playing a game with some of the other children that they were not aware they were involved and got into a fair amount of trouble for pinching. His teacher is a wonderful woman but is very young and inexperienced, especially with special needs children.  

My girlfriend can provide additional details shortly.  I just wanted to open this door for her to A) help her feel not so alone in her circumstances and B) discover resources and C) get a feel for what has and has not worked for you. Thank you all in advance, Heather.

&gt; The Imprinted Brain sets out a radical new theory of the mind and mental illness based on the recent discovery of genomic imprinting. Imprinted genes are those from one parent that, in that parent's interest, manifest themselves in an offspring rather than the diametrically opposed genes from the other parent. Seeking to find a sound evolutionary, genetic, and neuro-scientific basis for psychoanalysis, Christopher Badcock realized that research into autism completely discredited Freud but suggested a completely new basis for understanding the mind and mental illness. With the help of the leading Canadian bio-scientist, Bernard Crespi, he was eventually able to consolidate these insights into the imprinted brain theory outlined here and published many co-authored papers on the subject. This new theory casts some intriguing new light on other topics as diverse as the nature of genius, the appeal of detective fiction, and why psychoanalysis was so successful for a while, but failed to last.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/p2gjx/the_imprinted_brain_how_genes_set_the_balance_of/,792

Oh...background info: Son is 11yo with Aspergers. He was diagnosed at 6. He has an IEP and an aide. The aide used to be full-time but now only used during specials (art, PE, music) because those courses are still too much for him. 

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to help change this behavior. He's had anger management. I've taught him to take deep breaths. He has a plan with his teachers that when he needs a break he can go for a walk to calm down. Today when his teacher was having him walk he wasn't calming down. He will also hurt himself instead of hurting others.

She works with children on all levels of the spectrum, ages birth to twenty-one. She specializes in working with children who are non-verbal and utilize AAC devices, but has experience working with all ability levels as well.

She is currently working on a project (a presentation about visual supports which will be used to train other professionals), and as part of that project would like ideas for example visual supports. Rather than making up supports that will never be used, we thought it would be a neat idea to see if there is anyone on /r/autism who is in need of a visual support or two for their child. She's open to doing just about anything (social stories, visual schedules, basic communication boards, etc.). 

If you'd be interested, you can just PM me (or respond publicly) and let me know a little about your child (can be completely anonymous, of course, if you prefer) and what they need a visual support for (e.g. you're having a difficult time with dinner, or grocery runs, or getting them to request a snack they like, etc.)

Obviously there is a disclaimer attached to this that she is not providing professional services in any way, and if you need more than a basic example support you should of course seek help from a professional in your area.

In addition, the examples she creates will be used as part of a public presentation, although obviously she will not be discussing where they are inspired from or any other personal details that you may choose to share with her.

1359,Question Broad-based Behavioral Programs for Children with Autism,"Hi /r/autism, I am wondering if anyone knows if behavioral units, i.e. special classrooms for children with a wide-range of behavioral problems, are good or bad for children with autism. 

For instance, an autistic child I am working with (in out-treatment social skills training) is unruly and aggressive, and his special ed teachers have essentially given up on him. The teachers are suggesting to the parents to send the child to a ""behavioral unit"" at a different elementary school. My research into the program is that it is a classroom for kids with all sorts of diagnoses and behavioral problems.

I am wondering if anyone with experience knows if this is a good or bad suggestion. There is an alternative specialized school for children with autism, but that comes at considerable cost to the parents.

First of all, please excuse me if what I write seems stupid and crude to you. Up to this point, I never really had anything to do with autism and that's why I would love if you could help me to better understand it.

As the title says, I'm working in a psychiatry, on a secure ward to be more specific. Since lately, we have a young patient (about 18 years old) who has a psychosis but also is diagnosed with autism.
 
He is able to speak but will only do so with some people (I'm one of them), with others not at all. All in all he seems somewhat disorganised, for example when he takes a shower, he wants to put on his clothes right after and doesn't think of towelling himself. Still it's quiet hard to tell where the autism ends and his psychosis starts. For example, while he smiles an awful lot and is generally cooperative, he sometimes becomes really worked up and angry and starts to attack people.

My question is: Could you give me some advice on how to ""connect"" with him? Are there certain things to bear in mind when making contact with someone who has autism? When I talk to him, I'm friendly but try to keep a certain polite distance. I also talk to him like I would to every other patient and don't use simplified language but I'm not quiet sure whether he understands everything I say.
Is there some ""common ground"" or general ""do's"" and ""don'ts"" in terms of how to interact with people who have autism? It'd be great if you could help me!

1361,Would an autistic child be claimed as 'disabled' on a tax return?,"While preparing our taxes, the tax preparation software prompted me with the question, ""Are any of the children living at home disabled?""

He is diagnosed with autism and does receive services both through private insurance and state funded at preschool. He is verbal and high functioning, but has some delays particularly with self-care and social structures/behavior. 

I got to thinking about it and his care is a significant factor in our life. My wife is considering returning to work, but we are pretty limited by how to provide the care that our son needs. He gets ABA therapy at home 5 days a week, and occupational, speech, and behavioral therapy at school 4 days a week. All of that would need to be rearranged in order for my wife to smoothly return to work.

The oldest one always had motor problems, and with time also learning disabilities (and was never really able to make eye contact). I never talked about it much with my dad, but he's now 13yo, and it seems, diagnosed with ""nonverbal learning disorder"". The word autism or aspergers are NEVER brought up. He doesn't have any friends (but of course the whole family loves him and he never feels alone), he can't do a lot of things by himself and always needs help (I don't think he wears anything that has buttons). My dad has enough influence in the school he attends that I don't think he will ever fail/be left behing, is like he's using all his influence and money to make sure my brother has a normal life, when in fact, he is not an average boy.

My other brother is 10 now, and clearly already smarter than his older brother. I can see he is really confused about how much attention the other gets, and doesn't understand what's going on most of the time (""why does he get private classes and I don't? I need help too!""). I asked if my dad would talk to him about the other's ""special needs"" but he said it shouldn't be necessary.

I think my dad is very afraid of stigmatising the older brother, but I feel that that might prevent him (and his youngest) from having a happier life.

For some reason my step-mother lately seems very amused by Big Bang Theory's character Sheldon, and I like that she has found an example to relate to with her son, but the fact is he has not had an enough organised life to be able to be that functional (in other others, both her kids have always been very spoiled and sheltered).

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, I really don't feel like having to talk to my dad about any of this, it's his family...

1370,I really didn't believe my little girl was autistic until yesterday,"Izzy is 28 months old, and speech delayed. She's gotten pretty good at pantomiming, with some ASL but mostly her own gestures, and recently she's even started speaking in limited sentences, almost always negation: ""I not sleepy"", ""I not stinky"", but last night she started saying ""I love you, Mom."" ""I love you, Daddy.""

Izzy is SUPER affectionate. She LOVES hugs. She loves tickles. She loves to give kisses at bedtime.

She speaks with a severe impediment, which sounds like apraxia to me, but we have no diagnosis except ""Autism"".

One of her therapists, a teacher who uses ABA, came to the house yesterday and for once, I was home to see the session.

Izzy completed lots of tasks led by the teacher, like building a castle out of Duplo blocks and then making a little princess figure go in and out of doors, sit at a table, and so on. She painted, and colored, and put puzzles together.

Then the therapist brought out a big Rubbermaid tub full of paper excelsior and tried to get Izzy to grab a few handfuls of it.

She was TERRIFIED of the stuff. She cringed and shrank back and cried. When the therapist handed her some, she recoiled as if she had been burned.

I've NEVER seen her react to a texture like that before in my life. 

With some coaxing, Izzy did finally help clean up the paper shreds. She seemed comforted that it was being put away and she wouldn't have to play with it. Even so, she grabbed very small handfuls and pinched the paper in a way that it wouldn't curl around and touch the backs of sides of her hands. I've never, ever seen her do that before.

We're brand new to this and we have no idea at all of where Izzy falls on the spectrum. How do we figure it out? The teachers and therapists are mum on this topic.

Izzy is receiving therapy 3 days a week, sometimes up to 4 hours per day. My wife is adamant that we need to reduce the hours because it's too intrusive and she can't get anything done, visit her parents with Izzy, or basically ever leave the house (Izzy's schedule is pretty regimented but that's more our doing than hers, I honestly think.)

How do we, as parents, balance the need for therapy with the need to attend to everything else? The organization that works with Izzy almost certainly has a vested interest in maximizing hours, not only to justify their existence but so that they can bill as much as possible. How do you keep the hours reasonable while still making sure that it's enough?",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/oatz3/i_really_didnt_believe_my_little_girl_was/,583

Hi r/autism!

My name is Dan and I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at the age of 13, ten years ago.

After I was diagnosed, I decided to dedicate myself to learning social skills. I've spent the past ten years studying social skills---reading books, talking to experts, and seeking out friendships and interactions wherever I could.

My study paid off. I grew from a lonely, bullied boy to a confident, charismatic man. Relationships, which were once a source of fear and stress for me, are now the most important part of my life, and I love meeting new people.

One year ago, I realized that I needed to share what I've learned so it can help others. So I've spent the past year writing an online social skills guide called [Improve Your Social Skills](http://www.improveyoursocialskills.com). It has over 50 lessons covering everything from conversation to body language to making friends. I was very deliberate when I wrote it to make every lesson practical, easy to understand and easy to apply. If you want an example, why not jump in with the section on [how to make conversation](http://improveyoursocialskills.com/conversation)?

Check it out now, and let me know your feedback in the comments :) I'm especially interested to know what  parts of the guide you particularly liked, so I can add more of that in the future",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/o0qae/announcing_improveyoursocialskillscom_a/,920

1381,I really missed my chance to be an author,"(if you don't get it... this is one of the many social stories customized for a kiddo)


I need to learn how to use the potty by myself since I am a big boy.

I will hurry to the bathroom when I feel like I have to go pee or poop.

When I’m at home, I will let my mom and dad know that I have to go. I will tell them, “I need to go potty!”

When I’m at school, I will nicely ask my teacher if I can go to the bathroom.

Then I will go into the bathroom and close the door behind me. I need my privacy!

I will unbutton my pants, unzip my zipper, and pull down my pants.

Then I will pull down my underwear and sit on the toilet.

If I go poop, I need to learn how to wipe myself.

I will grab some toilet paper and fold it. Next, I bend over and reach behind me. I will wipe one time.

Next, I need to look behind me and check the toilet paper. Then I can drop the paper into the toilet bowl.

If the toilet paper was dirty, I need to get more toilet paper and wipe my bottom again.

I will wipe one time and check the toilet paper to see if it is still dirty.

I need to keep wiping my bottom and checking the toilet paper until it is clean!

When I’m clean, I can get off the toilet, pull up my underwear, pull up my pants, zip my zipper, and button my button.

I will flush the toilet and wash my hands.

My mom and dad will be SUPER PROUD of me if I do this by myself. We will all feel happy!!

1382,Does anyone have asperger's + ADHD or know the difference between the two?,"I've just been noticing that they seem a bit similar.  I have ADHD (the inattentive type), but I've been wondering if perhaps I'm slightly autistic too.  

For example, I had speech pathology all throughout elementary school, and I'm wondering whether this is more characteristic with autism/asperger's than it is with ADHD.  Also, even now, sometimes it takes me a long time how to learn to pronounce a word (one reason I don't think I could ever pick up a second language).  I'm also bad at interrupting and I'm a bit socially inept (at least I think so, my friends say I'm fine but a little quirky).  I also read that autistic people like to argue/debate and tend to be analytic or rigid thinkers... well, that's me too, lol.   So that's the social stuff... I don't know which is more characteristic of autism or ADHD, but they both seem to fit.

I was also a gullible kid, pretty oblivious to my surroundings, and had difficulty picking up jokes (especially sarcasm).  I'm still not the best at detecting jokes or telling jokes even as an adult.  Then I'm also quick to anger, forgetful, and fairly impulsive.  I know these are ADHD traits, but, again, it seems appropriate for autism/asperger's too (at least the anger and impulsiveness).

Then I also have pretty bad anxiety - like I don't sleep if I'm worried even about the simplest thing (then spend hours or days procrastinating) or I have heart palpitations if I try to work faster when I'm worried about doing well; not to mention I'm a nervous driver.  I know anxiety is a symptom of ADHD, but is it also a symptom of autism?  

I also cannot sleep unless there is no noise and I'm at the perfect temperature.  It drives my significant other nuts, lol.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/n9mp3/does_anyone_have_aspergers_adhd_or_know_the/,925
1383,Has anyone had a Medicaid Fair Hearing for Autism Services due to denial of eligibility?,"Im seeking advice in regards to anyone who may have gone through this process. I am hoping to find out if anyone had a successful result after a denial by the committee who reviews eligibility for services to assist your child. 
In mental health law autism is a developmental disability by definition.
The committee's exact words is that he does not have a developmental disability. We submitted tons of proof ranging from neurological diagnosis to ieps, video eegs, detailed medical reports, and so on..
My child has so many issues from autism, its like we are battling a war daily again autism. We sought out help and was recommended to a program, however the program receives its funding from medicaid.
We already had a second step review with a face to face and are still being denied. They state that even though my child has a qualifying diagnosis that his adaptives (vineland scores) are too high to qualify.
His special ed teacher is scoring him too high, whereas our parental vineland score is much lower. My son does fairly well in school, but once out of the restrictive environment all hell breaks loose with his autistic behaviors and mannerisms. I tried inquiring about how they can use a vineland based on a restricted environment with tons of authority figures in a classroom that help my son as reflective of how my son is and if he needs help in the world. They did not respond to my questions. They mailed me the denial almost two months after it was written leaving little time to set up a medicaid fair hearing. I dont know if I should go through it. The medicaid intake coordinator indicated that people who do fair hearings have the same result. I dont know what to believe. I was told they would bring lawyers to the hearing and I dont have the funds for one. I tried calling a free legal service not long ago and they did not call back. Im devastated for my child. We were hoping to enroll him in activities to help him and possibly respite services. Unfortunately the denial will prevent him from receiving these services. This process was initiated over a year ago. I have enrolled him in cub scouts as some sort of alternative but cub scouts is for 1 hour a week and hardly begins to cover the benefits that additional services may provide.

Anyway, he dated a girl a few months ago that was my worst nightmare come true.  She picked up on him having a disability and used that to her advantage financially.  She convinced him to be in an exclusive relationship and from there made him think that boyfriends buy their girlfriends 2 ipads, fancy jewelry, furniture and clothes.  She also got absurd quantities of cash out of him.  In roughly eight weeks, she blew through his life savings before he broke up with her.  

I wonder if anyone else has gone through a similar situation and could offer advice on this.

I'm only discussing what seems unusual delayed development to me. Indeed, this may not be autism at all. 

I need to keep many details vague, but here's the gist.

I have a family member with a toddler who appears to be exhibiting some possible symptoms of ASD. I'm trying to figure out the best way to broach the topic and encourage a development assessment. The &lt;3 yo toddler shows behavior which immediately sends up warning signals. Symptoms include inability to form sentences, with few words in the vocabulary, usually only one or two words strung together, but lots of nonsensical babbling; Slowed motor skills, including tip-toe walking; Hiding the face/whimpering when new people enter the room; intense focus on single activities for an hour or more at a time (blocks, coloring, etc). Limited socialization with other toddlers and slowed emotional reactions (fear and laughter, yes, but little spontaneous reaction to many activities). 

The parents seem reluctant to admit their toddler is on the spectrum of slowed development. More than anything, I want to encourage them to seek assessment/treatment.

1390,Though experiment - Neanderthal connection. Looking for research on Autism rates in genetically pure Africans to disprove.,"I found very interesting earlier in the year reading research into inter species cross breeding, where all non African humans have Neanderthal genes. Theory being that as humans came out of Africa we not only wiped out the Neanderthals but we bred with them as well.

Some of the attributes of Neanderthals compared to humans do fit the Autism diagnosis - solitary, not very sociable, possibly more systematic behaviours etc. This got me a hmmmm.... this could be an interesting thought experiment.

Combining Neanderthal genes with human genes would of course lead to weird results that would balance out over time, which is of course what seems to have happened. But the genes that survive will generally give an advantage either individually or to a group. A society that has lots of nerdy aspies potentially gains more competitive advantages than those that shun them as freaks, so this could be a scenario in how any genetic infrastructure for the condition is sustained.

Easiest way to disproved any link with Neanderthals would be to get a good study that showed African Autism / ASD to be equal (or higher) to rest of world. But the study would need to be genetically pure African, not potentially mixed race, even if very slightly.

I dont care about environmental factors. Yes it is likely an influence blah blah blah. Just looking for ASD rates in genetically pure Africans, where ever they live and at any standard of living.

He is highly autistic and has been his whole life, his communication is through mumbles, sounds, and occasional hand gestures. He LOVES to walk, pace, and jog. At times he will scream out and sort of giggle in a sense, purely by monitoring him over years I have assumed when he makes these noises he is happy, although it will happen randomly but a lot of the time when he is playing in the bath tub. He is a wonderful person and I love both him and his family, they are very close to me. My main reason for this post is I have a question about a single behavior that I cannon't understand and neither can his family. Randomly at times he will begin to hit both of his temples extremely hard to the point of swelling and redness if he has enough time to get multiple hits. By first guess I am assuming he's angry but with more monitoring it will come at times when I am just completely confused.

1393,Autism and soy.,"Just an idea, no science. 

Many, or possibly all, autistic people have a bad reaction to soy protein. An improvement in their condition can sometimes be made by cutting out the soy.

Now, what is increasingly a part of any and almost all processed foods? It is in candy bars, fast food, chips, almost anything sold prepackaged, and yes... Baby formula.

We are being fed it more and more from birth, and it has a demonstrable effect on people with autism.

1396,Autism &amp; not swallowing spit?,"Has anyone dealt with something similar?

My brother, aged 20, is non-verbal and medium-to-low functioning autistic. About a year and a half ago, he stopped swallowing his saliva. Instead, he will hold it up in his mouth and spit it into paper towels or into sinks. 

The behavior started suddenly. One day he was fine and then the next he spit. Analyzing every inch of the day, nothing unusual appears to have happened. He's been to doctors, but they couldn't find anything wrong and say that it's behavioral. The behavioral specialists haven't made any headway and can't find any sort of trigger. They haven't heard or experienced any similar cases. He has no problems eating or drinking.

Whenever anyone tries to talk with him about it, he gets extremely upset and shuts down.

It's affecting his life negatively in a number of ways though. Strangers are wary of him, it makes going fun places hard, and him rubbing spit off his hands (what he does when rag gets too soaked or he is without one) and onto everything is pretty unsanitary.

1404,Autistic breakdown,"I have this autistic friend I met in high school. We became great friends and hung out quite often. When I went off to do my undergraduate degree he went to a special needs college to learn how to live independently (somewhat). As he finished his school, I was finishing up my undergrad and thinking about grad school. Here is some background on his situation after he graduated.

He continuously moved between his dad's house an his mom's house. Neither of which was a very important part of his life in his earlier years. The woman who took care of him the vast majority of his 21 years had recently passed away. His dad was mean to him, called him ""faggot"" and ""retard"" on multiple occasions. His mom was unable to support him financially because even when he was living with his mom his dad was still taking is SSI checks. We actually had an issue with that when we first moved in but a few calls to social security cleared that right up and he was no longer able to steal money that was rightfully my friends.

So with my friend ready to work and his parents not being very supportive, and me heading to grad school in a new city, I decided it would be beneficial for him to move in with me and start learning a little independence and we could try to get him a job. Well things started out a little rocky with jobs not hiring and his dad stealing money, but we got all that worked out. He now has a job at Wal-mart and he is finally making his own money (most of which is going to backpay some of the bills he fell behind on). Things seemed to be going ok.

Just recently things started to slide downhill. He has a girlfriend (really just a long distance call buddy) that he has been arguing with. I think he said some people at work have been bossing him around but I believe its just people telling him what to do because its a job, ya know? He's been getting a lot sadder lately and I've been talking to him and trying to give him advice on these things. Tonight it all kind of went out of control. I decided to take him out with some friends because he was complaining about being cooped up in the house all the time. So we went to this restaurant and we were playing trivia. We ate and had a couple of beers and we seemed to be having a good time. We were on the last round and he said he wanted to leave. I told him to wait a little while because it was the last round of trivia. He seemed fine. A couple min more pass and he asks me to leave and I tell him again. ""We can leave in a little bit, this game is almost over."" After a few more time asking I get a little more stern and say ""We will leave when the game is over."" It all seems to be fine for a few minutes and we are discussing the question that was just asked when I heard something hit the floor with some force. It was the pen that the waitress had given him to sign his receipt with (Im teaching him how to  use a debbit card). I look at him and he grab and throws it on the ground, then picks up his water cup and throws it on the ground shattering it and spilling water everywhere. He gets up flips his stool over and storms out. Now, I am completely embarrassed. I ask the waitress if I can pay really quick while my friends are picking up the shattered cup. I tell my friends I am sorry and leave with him. I can't get him to tell me why he did this, but he told me he does it sometimes when I get upset. 

What should I do? I feel like I may have bitten off more than I can chew. I am very busy with a job in research and graduate school. Keep in mind I am not related to my roommate, we are just friends, but I think living here is still better than living with his parents. Any advice out there would be greatly appreciated.

Some background info on myself: 22 year old graduate student of medical physics. Friends with my current roommate since I was 16 and he was 14. We met in class but hung out in different places.

Some background info on my roommate: 21 year old. Graduated from a special needs school (Roosevelt Warm Springs). He has Asperger's syndrome. I don't know how to describe the severity but I will try. He didn't start speaking until he was 8 to which he would only speak to his mother (not biological but the woman he was living with) until age 14. At that time he started speaking to me and really came out of his shell. I would describe him as moderately disabled and highly ADHD. He cannot drive a car or operate any machinery kind of thing, and he can't read or write very well, but his conversation skills are not THAT bad.

1405,"My 11yo son is autistic, and going through puberty...","Until today all difficulties we have encountered have been met with understanding, tolerance and alternative options which have worked. However, today we were presented with a new problem which I need Reddit's help with... a little background first.

My son is 11 years old and autistic from birth. He is non-verbal and does not perceive words as communication. He has learned very limited sign language but only relating to his immediate wants and needs. He cannot express himself emotionally except through violence to himself when angry or wild unchecked behavior when he is happy. Conversation is lost on him, although he does enjoy being talked to.

Now to the problem... As I said he is going through puberty. it's hitting him hard. He has begun masturbating in his room with his door open as he does not understand boundaries or acceptable behavior in society. The only remedy to this I know is to try and tell him that he needs to close his door and do this in private for obvious reasons. Today it became a problem.

When he got home from school today his bus driver had a disgusted look an her face and her assistant was busy with the paper towels and disinfectant working furiously to clean the seat he was sitting in. As I approached the bus she informed me of his extra-curricular activities on his trip home from school. This was the first time, but it doesn't take a genius to know that it wont be the last.

To the question... Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to help him get control of this or make him understand that this is not acceptable behavior outside of his home? I though about taking him to and from school every day, but we are limited financially and already stretched paper thin with a vehicle I dread driving just a few blocks. My thinking is it's just a matter of time before this starts happening in the middle of class. Once that starts he will not be allowed back into school until this issue is dealt with. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advanced. :)

tl;dr... my 11y-o non-verbal autistic son has hit puberty and is engaging in inappropriate behavior at school and on the bus ride home. Any suggestions as to how we can deal with this without completely isolating him from the rest of the world for the next 3 to 5 years?

(Oct 14th, 2011)

&gt; BACKGROUND:

&gt; The brain develops in concert and in coordination with the developing facial tissues, with each influencing the development of the other and sharing genetic signaling pathways. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) result from alterations in the embryological brain, suggesting that the development of the faces of children with ASD may result in subtle facial differences compared to typically developing children. In this study, we tested two hypotheses. First, we asked whether children with ASD display a subtle but distinct facial phenotype compared to typically developing children. Second, we sought to determine whether there are subgroups of facial phenotypes within the population of children with ASD that denote biologically discrete subgroups.

&gt; RESULTS:

&gt; First, we found that there are significant differences in facial morphology in boys with ASD compared to typically developing boys. Second, we also found two subgroups of boys with ASD with facial morphology that differed from the majority of the boys with ASD and the typically developing boys. Furthermore, membership in each of these distinct subgroups was correlated with particular clinical and behavioral traits.

*Excerpt from [page 18](http://www.scribd.com/embeds/69338052/content?start_page=18):*

&gt; The cluster analysis of all participants indicates that the majority of boys with ASD clustered with the TD boys. However, there are two subgroups of boys with ASD who were different from both the other boys with ASD and TD boys on the basis of overall facial morphology.

&gt; The first principal axis accounted for 31.32% of the variance in the study population. Twelve of the individuals with ASD (18.8% of the ASD study group) clustered separately at the high positive end of this axis. The linear distances that were reduced in this subgroup relative to the remainder of the ASD sample population include those that connected landmarks at [glabella](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Glabella), [nasion](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nasion) and inner and outer [canthi](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Canthi), with landmarks located on the mouth. The linear distances that were increased in this subgroup relative to the remainder of the ASD sample population include those spanning the breadth of the mouth and those connecting the corners of the mouth with the chin.

&gt; The second principal axis accounted for 11.37% of the variance in the study population. Seven of the individuals with ASD (7.8% of the ASD study group) clustered at the strongly negative end of this axis. The linear distances that were reduced in this subgroup relative to the remainder of the ASD sample population spanned the area from the inferior aspect of the nasal region to the [philtrum](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Philtrum) and lateral mouth. The linear distances that were increased in this subgroup relative to the remainder of the ASD sample population (1) spanned the breadth of the upper face and (2) connected the lateral aspect of the upper face with the inferior aspect of the nasal region.

&gt; ...

&gt; *Comparisons of clinical and behavioral phenotypes among facial morphology subgroups*

&gt; ...

&gt; *Subgroup 1* was characterized by increased autism severity scores on the SCQ, low frequency of Asperger syndrome diagnoses, lower cognitive scores based on significant FSIQ and NVIQ scores less than 70, increased regression, decreased macrocephaly and decreased total problem scores on the CBCL. By contrast, *subgroup 2* was characterized by increased Asperger syndrome diagnoses, decreased autism severity scores on the SCQ and increased incidence of macrocephaly.

1417,Newly diagnosed son (mid-spectrum) age 5. I'm having a hard time dealing with the diagnosis as a dad. Any advice?,"**Context:**

I am a proud dad of three beautiful kids. Oldest is 7, very bright. Middle one is going to be five soon and was recently diagnosed with mid-spectrum autism. Youngest is 3 and is also very bright.

I have been a volunteer with the Learning Disabilities Association for 7+ years so I know a bit about learning disabilities and associated conditions (like Autism). My mom is a special education aide in the school system here and works with autistic kids all the time. 

I also have a 35 year-old cousin who is mid-spectrum autistic as well. We grew up very close to one another and I love him dearly but his independence as an adult and capacity to have meaningful relationships with people are very limited.

**My issue:**

I think it's mostly baggage to do with my 35 year-old cousin who will never marry, will never have a family of his own and will never be able to live independently.

I am very sad for my son right now and I am having a hard time not crying while I write this because while this diagnosis means that he will get help now, I am so scared that he'll end up like my cousin.

I love my cousin very much but my son craves human contact (unlike my cousin) and I want him to have high quality relationships as an adult that enrich his life and I worry that if he ends up like my cousin, he won't have that and will be sad.

I'm sorry if I am not making sense or offending anyone but this is all really fresh for me (just found out six days ago) and I am trying to come to terms with what this means for my son and his future.

Any advice, perspective or insight you guys can give me would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

I have a 3 year old, she is recently diagnosed high functioning autistic.  I'm not sure if it's a normal symptom, but lately she's been unlocking and unbolting the front and back door when I take my eyes off her.  It only takes a few minutes, and I'm limiting her mobility (moving her into her room with a gate up) when I do an activity that will last longer than 10 minutes with her out of my sight.  

However, lately she has been bolting out of the house in a matter of a minute or two.  Our door has a bolt lock and knob lock, does anyone have any success with a device that prevents the opening of the door?

Keeping in mind she can't talk and uses very basic sign language, the idea of microchipping her is looking more and more like a good idea.  (that is me half joking!  Really though, has anyone done that?)

Thank you much!

1422,Please help!  My 3-year-old autistic nephew likes to paint with his own poop.  Brother is about to lose it.,"My brother is at his wits' end.  He is an awesome stay-at-home dad (mom works) and has 3 sweet little boys: 5, 3, and 2 years old.  His 3-year-old (we'll call him Poopcasso) is autistic, and is a wizard at escaping from his clothing, dipping into his diaper, and smearing every available surface in the house with feces.  This week alone, it has happened 5 times.  He got the TV more than once, and they are going to have to replace it; they can't clean it out of the crevices.

My brother is a very doting and attentive father, and all three boys are crazy about him.  The oldest is in kindergarten and goes to see his Grandma and Uncle down the block often, giving my brother a chance to spend more time with the younger ones.  However, he can't keep an eye on Poopcasso every second of the day.  And he cannot ask more of his in-laws, as his mother-in-law is battling cancer and very sick; she enjoys seeing her grandson, but one kid at a time is about all they can handle, and the five-year-old is the easiest to care for.

My brother is losing it.  He is tired of cleaning up poop almost every single day.  It is becoming a health hazard in their home.

He layers clothing on Poopcasso, but the little guy always finds a way out.  Even if he can't get his pants off (he'll leave the shirt, but hates pants), he will still try to dig in there for some media to create with.  And it is difficult to catch him at night.

Redirective play hasn't met with any success. He has fun with the Play-Doh and mushing up bananas, but he still goes back to the diaper.

I have zero idea of how to help.  If ANYONE has had a similar experience and has any words of advice, it would be greatly appreciated.  Poopcasso's doctor predicts that he will most likely be in diapers until he is around 8-12 years old.  While his parents can accept that, they cannot deal with the constant poop-smearing habits.

It would also be good if I could find someone who understands how to put together a book.

1424,What helps against symptoms of autism?,"First of all, I understand that autism can have its upsides, like great attention to detail, outstanding memory and/or complete focus on a single subject. 

But there are also things that are less enjoyable, such as tantrums, poor social skills, too much or a lack of fear and stress from some everyday tasks. Some people use tricks or devices to prevent/mask these. Examples are the squeeze machine of Temple Grandin, [the squeaze vest](http://www.squeasewear.com),  repetitive movements and social interaction cards. 

This leads to my question; **what is it that you use/do to cope with the symptoms of autism?**

In every class she noticed the same issues; kids are lonely, isolated and don't know what to do about it. They want friends, boy/girlfriends but don't know where to start.

A few months ago my mother and I started [Social Signals](https://socialsignalsed.com/) and finished a DVD and curriculum that uses movies we made (I went to film school) to teach social skills to teens and adults and now we're about to finish the home version. 

Just to be upfront, of course we would like to make a profit eventually for our hard work. But right now, we’re just trying help as many people as possible because kids and adults are having a horrible time teaching social skills to themselves and some are even going to jail when they absolutely don't need to.

We'd love to hear your questions but because every person with autism is so different and we haven't met them, we can't be held liable for advice. That being said, we know parents are very nervous and scared about this topic and really want to help.

She has trouble integrating into social circles, however, and has a very limited number of ""friends."" She tends to become very attached, to the point of driving away most people. I think this attachment is due to her scarcity of friends, causing a vicious and depressing cycle. These problems have caused great distress for her and my family, as I'm sure you all can understand.

I have close friends with an Autistic child and after listening to them complain about how expensive applications for autistic children can be (some are literally hundreds of dollars) I thought that I could create an app that would do exactly what my friend's needed and provide it at a cost that is a fraction of what the other companies are charging.

My app contains 6 categories that each contain up to 12 images.  The images and sounds in the app can be easily customized by the parent or care giver.  If you find that your child is struggling to learn all 12 items at the same time, the app even features a ""Learning Mode"" where you can selectively disable some of the pictures.

My boyfriend I moved in with me 4 years ago. He moved from England to the Netherlands to be with me. 
When my mother first saw him she said that he was a sweet boy but something was ""off"". I love him deeply and even if he is autistic I wouldn't love him any less. 

Anyway, this is why i think he is autistic. 

1. He never looks anyone in the eye. He looks me in the eyes but no one els. Not even my parents who he has known for 4 years now. I dont think he even looks his own parents in the eyes. 

2. To say he is socially akward is the understatement of the year. In social situations he often results to just summing up random facts he heard on the internet leaving people thinking he is weird. 
Despite this when he comes home he often has story's of people he met on the bus and talked to. This is because when someone say's hi to him he starts reciting his random fact and some people respond good to that. 
He is always obsessing about what other people think about him. 

3. He does not understand jokes, sarcasm, or irony. He takes everything literally. My dad likes to make sarcastic jokes and joke around with people and he always takes it literally thinking my dad was angry at him/insulted him and i always have to explain to him that it was a joke. After 4 years he still doesn't understand.  

4. Everything has to be logical. If it isn't 100% logical he does not understand it. He thought him self 4 computer programming languages in 2 years and he is absolutely brilliant with programming but the cant grasp the dutch language. He say's its because dutch isn't logical.
He get really irritated at things that are not logical because he simply can not understand it. 

5. He often complains that his head is busy and never stops thinking. That he cant shut it off and it often leads to him being completely absorpt by it and getting agitated and on edge.

6. Everything has to be in routine. I can not stress this enough. If something unexpected happens he freaks out. If dinner plans change i need to let him know day's in advance or he simply can not cope. And he will still get extremely on edge and nervous. 

7. He can not handle crowds or situations that have loads of impulses. I notice it because he will go silent, get agitated and when i ask him whats up he just tells me its his head. 
We always go shopping early in the morning and leave before it gets crowded because of this. 

He is the sweetest boy i have ever known and I love him deeply, nothing can change this. 
At the start of the relationship we had a lot of arguments, mainly because i did not understand him, or why he was freaking out so much about little things. 
Ever since i started to suspect autism I started to change my behavior towards him and it made a huge difference. 
I make sure everything stay's in routine and if something is changing then i tell him day's in advance. 
I dont take his freakouts personally anymore and realize its just his head playing up. I notice the signs when things are starting to overload on him. I then tell him to just browse some reddit or something. After a hour or so of doing that he is suddenly ok again. 
It only mainly play's up a lot when he has a lot going on or has stress. When he is completely relaxed you would hardly notice he is different. 

He currently has a job since a couple months but it isn't going to plan. Now i am not saying its all his fault, he has a lot of communication issues between him and his boss/co-workers. When it comes to programming he is a perfectionist and he gets really agitated when other people are not. He also doesn't understand how they cant be/want to be like him. He doesn't know how to communicate with his boss and instead bottles all his frustrations up to come out at home. He also misunderstands what his boss say's a lot and takes everything literally and personally and has a huge feeling of responsibility for his work even if that responsibility isn't his but his boss. 

The thing is my boyfriend has never bin diagnosed with anything. And he doesn't know what i suspect. His parents did mention they thought his behavior is weird but they just tell him is he weird and never bothered to have him checked out. When he has a freak out they just laugh it off and say "" well that just typical boyfriendsname"" 

I dont know if i should tell him or not. At one hand i think he has the right to know. On the other hand i am not sure if it would help him at this point. He already has a lot of stress of his new job and he is only barely coping. I am afraid telling him he might be autistic will push him over the edge. Before i changed my behavior towards him and he was at his worst I did tell him it might be a good idea to see a therapist. Just to help sort out his head. He was extremely against that and refused to even talk about it. 

I know you guys can not make a diagnoses. But i know nothing about autism. I was wondering if the story's I told about him sound like someone who has autism. And if so what is the best thing i can do for him? tell him or just keep my mouth shut?
Any advice would be really appreciated!

1438,"My sister has a developmental disability that shares some similarities to autism. I'm not sure what the future will hold, or how to plan.","I apologize if this is the wrong reddit, but this is the closest I could find. My sister is 33, I am 25 and just now realizing that my parents don't really have their shit together, so I've decided to try to take the initiative and see where that goes.

I know the state (we're in Olympia, WA) will always provide a little bit of assistance, but I'm kind of in the dark because I haven't talked to my parents about this a whole lot. I have two other siblings as well but we've never discussed the future, especially one without our parents around. 

My sister is quite challenging to take care of, and I think it has worn significantly on my mother. Unfortunately my dad apparently at one point basically said ""I don't want to be her legal guardian"" and while he's come around a bit from there, some resentment still remains.

My parents have maybe 5 functional years left max.

Oh and I don't really have a great career at this point (unless you count working min wage as a great career).

1441,"Group Homes, Can You Be Forced Into One? Need Info on Them...","This is a slightly odd topic I guess, but my bf is terrified of his mother putting him into a group home. This is very much not wanted as he is going to college and making a life for himself. 

Can you be forced into one? He's high functioning, and his mother is slightly on the abusive side of things... So I'm wondering if this is even a legit threat or if there are flaws to it. 

I don't know anything about group homes, I do admit. Do they cost money? How do they work? And is it possible for the person to get out of them if he obviously does not want to be there? For reference he's 24 and has his whole life ahead of him. 

I'm scared of never seeing him again etc, and I really don't know what to do.

Right now he's not being sent to one, but it seems to be a constant threat from his mother that keeps popping up. 

He's very uncomfortable at home because of her constant abuse and such. Do we have an option for him not to go to a group home? (Honestly he doesn't need it.)

Edit: Ok, so a better idea of his fears since I think I have it wrong: ""I'm just afraid that if I cut the cord, that I'll lose my police ambitions, and also have nowhere to live. And I'm disabled, which means I wouldn't be on the streets for long.""

Though if he was on the streets, I would probably try to take him in.... *sigh* This is all too stressful for me. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/jrjps/group_homes_can_you_be_forced_into_one_need_info/,684

My wife told me about autistic inertia.  Where she heard about it, I don't know.  If my diagnosis is correct, and this concept is actually real, knowing more about it might help me, because it seems to be a big part of me -- why I focus enthusiastically on a topic every waking moment for years, then suddenly stop and pick up another topic just as enthusiastically, why I announced in a job interview that if the employer bored me that he'd have to fire me, why I have had immense difficulty paying my bills until I get a collection notice, despite having enough money to pay them, and numerous other things that sometimes have massive consequences.

1448,I'm a single mother of two children with ASD AMA,"I'm a mother of a son and a daughter with ASD. If you have any questions please feel free to ask.

Edit:My daughter is 4 and my son is 3. They are 12 months 4 days apart. My daughter had a grand mal seizures as a baby and was hospitalized, and was put under the care of a pediatric neurologist. She was put on Oxcarbazepine for the next 2 years of her life. She started to show early signs of late development like not speaking till she was almost 2 and she didn't walk until she was 16 months. Yes, it was very difficult holding a new baby in a carrier and a 16 month old child everywhere. She did crawl around 12 months so that helped. After the 4th seizure I was in the doctors office and saw a poster for local EI (early intervention)my county. The poster had pictures of babies on it and asked questions like: Does your child walk? Does your child eat with a fork? and so on. I immediately said no to all of the questions and wrote down the number on the poster.
After calling and giving my insurance information they scheduled for a nurse to come out and give my daughter an evaluation. Two therapist came out and saw my daughter. One being a speech and behaviorist, and a social worker that worked with the county. Up until this point I/we all thought she was delayed because of her seizures and thought nothing of it being anything else. After the evaluations was over they crunched the numbers and turned to me and said ""She qualifies for services through EI and we recommend she gets evaluated by a pediatric developmental neurologist for Autism."" As you could imagine I was happy and sort of shocked at the same time. I was thrilled she would be getting in home one on one therapy, but I never dreamed she could have autism. At that point I didn't know what autism was so I hit the internet, and lets just say I cried for a few days/weeks. I started to see signs of autism in my daughter. Like, when she would watch tv or heard a song she would flap her hands up and down. Or her non desire to touch anything cold and wet was just a thing she was going through. I thought this was cute, I had no idea this was a sign of autism. The next few months were a blur. I took her to the PDN and she was diagnosed with Autism. I gave her seizure medication in the morning and and night. She had a developmental therapist come 5 hours a week, Occupational therapist 5 hours a week, speak therapist 5 hours a week, and a feeding therapist 5 hours a week. Let's just say I had therapist coming in and out of my house like clock work.(you have to pull teeth to get services) When my son was finally born she was 1 years old and non verbal and didn't walk so she had to go stay with her grandparents house while I had my son. For some reason while I was gone someone taught her how to use a fork. It was a pleasant surprise when I came home. Only being in the hospital for one day I headed home with new baby in tow as fast as I could. I didn't want to miss a minute with my daughter and I was anxious to know if all of her needs were being met. (I may have felt like I was the only one who could care for her properly) fast forward and she is 4 years old now and in a school that caters to kids with special needs. She also goes to a social group another town to teach her social skills. Verbally she is not up to speed with other kids her age, but it's nice to hear her call me mommy. She is low on the spectrum and is more emotional then anything. It takes her a long time to get over things, and she is defiant like you wouldn't believe. Potty training was easy for her and she is doing well in school. She will not be going into a mainstreamed class for Kindergarten. 
My son is 3 and is 56 pounds and is 3 feet 5 inches tall. He a large boy for his age and has been his whole life. He did great right out the gate. When he was 9 months old he started to walk (i have video to prove it) he gave up the bottle at 12 months like it was nothing. He even started to count to 10 at 12 months (he sat in on therapy sessions so I think he just caught on) he had good eye contact and focus like you wouldn't believe. One day we took him to the doctors for his shots. He was given all of his cheduled shots like my daughter had received before. A few days later I noticed a difference in my son. He was having trouble with the smallest things like looking at me and loud sounds. Now I am by no means blaming the shots for making my son autistic but something happened and I will say it was over night. I took him to the PDN the following week. She did diagnose him with ASD as well. I was floored! How could this be I said? The doctor in formed me that is rare to have two kids on the spectrum and recommended me to go see a geneticist. I took him home and called the same number I had did a few months back and scheduled an evaluation. They came again and couldn't believe my son was the patient this time. They all knew him well and couldn't understand why he would need services. After the evaluation I was on pins and needles. He just fit the criteria for services and was put on the same schedule as my daughter. He did how ever get his own therapist for feeding.
Fast forward my son attends the same school as my daughter and is still non verbal and is very high on the spectrum. He is still in special diapers and can get over stimulated and freak out often. He is going to be tested for prader willi syndrome in the fall. He still gets one on one therapy in another facility once a week. They both still see the PDN. 
My son was tested for seizures and was negative for any wave misfires.
After finding out both of my kids have ASD I opted not to have anymore children. I couldn't bring another child into this world not knowing if I was passing on the genes that caused autism (I'm adopted and have no medical history)",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/jabzw/im_a_single_mother_of_two_children_with_asd_ama/,59

1451,"r/autism, let's chat.  Tell us a few unique things about the autistic person in your life.  I'll start.","I have an older brother who's autistic.  That right there is unusual by itself, because parents often stop having kids after an autistic child.  I was a ""happy accident"". *trollface*

His autism is quite severe, and he will never live an independent life.  He has caretakers full time.  Luckily, he lives in a place where there are government programs to finance his caretaking needs.

When I was growing up, I was jealous of the amount of extra attention and consideration he got.  Occasionally I would even mimic autistic behaviors to compete with him for attention.

I'm told that when my brother was little, he would not make direct eye contact.  My parents felt that he had a way of ""looking right through you"".  They attempted to remedy this by teaching him about looking at peoples' eyes.  Evidently this early retraining worked, only too well.  It resulted in my brother having a lifelong, permanent obsession with eyes.  Whenever he sees someone he knows well, he will get a big grin on his face and ask them to open their eyes big, close them tight, then blink them repeatedly.  He can tell you the eye color of any significant person in his life.

Being his jealous younger brother, I was intimately acquainted with his rage triggers.  I could do certain things which anyone else would see as innocuous, that I knew would set him off.  For instance, I could grin at him and subtly point at any glass window, and he would become upset that I might break the window (I've never in my life broken a window).

He's now in his late 30's but still has the vocabulary of about a 3 year old.  And as a recent article pointed out, he does not seem to understand proper use of pronouns.  He understands best when you never use the 1st or 2nd person pronouns -- i.e., just refer to himself, yourself and anybody else by their first name.

1456,Help dealing with my mother,"Hey all. First post here.
My little brother was diagnosed early with autism (PDD-NOS at 3) and he's 18 now. I've got some mental health issues as is common with siblings of people with autism but that's not really relevant to this.

My mother....*sigh* I don't know how to deal with her. She's adamantly anti-vaccination. My brother has not been vaccinated since the MMR IIRC and before I figured out that she was full of crap, I hadn't been getting my vaccinations. I'm not so much worried about me- I'm 20 now and I'll be talking with my doctor the next time I go about getting me up to date on my vaccinations. 

I worry about my brother. I don't want him sick with something preventable. He has a compromised immune system as it is. The thought of him dying from measles or crippled by polio when it could have been prevented with one shot...it scares the crap out of me, and I feel guilty and helpless.

Not only that, but she spoke with my dentist's wife (she's his hygienist, and we're good friends with the two of them) who is pregnant at the moment. The hygienist said to me, ""Wow, your mom really knows her stuff about these vaccines...that's scary. I'm really glad I found out about all this before we vaccinated the baby...""

She's not open to any discussion on the subject. Normally she's extremely level-headed (degree in electronics and she's an RN) but she's going full conspiracy theorist on anything relating to autism. She's been giving my brother chelation therapy ("" Other side effects include fever, headache, nausea, stomach upset, vomiting, convulsions, bone marrow depression, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory arrest, and hypocalcemia. Other concerns include kidney failure, which can require permanent life-limiting and expensive dialysis, or cause death."") and a whole host of pseudoscientific crap. I don't know how to handle this. I'm dependent on my parents for, well, just about everything right now, but I can't just stand by and let this happen. 

Is there anything I might be able to do? I feel like it's rather hopeless since she's into the whole conspiracy mindset, but I feel like if I don't do anything I'll hold myself partly responsible if there are any ill effects on my brother...",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/isz3x/help_dealing_with_my_mother/,59

1461,Awesome in Public,"Just wanted to balance out the recent 'assholes in public' stories. Don't get me wrong - I have more asshole stories than I'd care to count and it still gets to me in a big way when it happens but for those of you who haven't experienced the other side of the coin, I thought it might help to at least be aware of its existence. For the record, I have Asperger's and my boy is at the 'low-functioning' end of the autism spectrum.

I take my son to our local main st shopping area a lot and when he was younger and not very skilled yet with communication, he'd get very frustrated and have meltdowns and the assholes would inevitably glare, mutter and scold. It's the kind of area where you tend to see the same people all the time. 

One evening when he was about three-and-a-half I took him to a favourite restaurant of mine on the main st. As I was having my coffee at the end of the meal, a man from the table opposite came over. He said to me, ""I've seen you around here quite a lot. It's great that you can bring your son to a restaurant. Our son is 9 and we still can't really do that. Anyway, I just really wanted to say to you that I know you struggle but you're doing a *great* job. You're a *good mum*.""  That one brought tears to my eyes. Who'd have known - some of the people looking at you in public are looking on with compassion, not contempt.

I've also had two instances of people coming over and offering help mid-meltdown, rather than offering unsolicited parenting advice. I'm really hoping some of you out there have some similar experiences to share.

I don't know much about Autism except that you're not very social at all and whatever I read on Wikipedia. My question to you guys is what should I do? How should I act? Will I have to be overly patient with him ? Will I have to be extra nice?

1464,My son showing signs of autism and assholes in public.,"Today was Mother's Day and I was excited to take my one and only little boy out to ice cream. We went to a local ice cream and burger joint and everything went fine during our dinner. When we got our ice cream he got a little excited and started running around. I would get up from our table and ask him to come back. He always listens if I try and have fun with him. I try to never force him to do anything because a sudden change like that causes him to throw pretty massive fits. 

I got up a few times and was thinking of getting a high chair (he's three) when an old man starts scolding me. He asked, ""What's wrong with you?!"" I stopped and said, ""My son is autistic"" In his old crotchety age he asks me to repeat myself so I shout ""MY SON IS AUTISTIC."" Now that everyone is looking he says, ""Oh, well, you shouldn't take him out."" ""What do you expect me to do, lock him in the house?"" To which he replies, ""You shouldn't take him here."" 

Now, let me remind you that this little burger place is not exactly a four star restaurant. At this point he tells me to go away to which I reply, ""You stopped me, you better be prepared for what I have to say."" I storm off and get my things from the table. My face is flushed red with color and I felt like I'd never be that embarrassed again. I can't stop my tears, my shoulders were shaking as I wept. The manager stops me and asks me if I'm okay. I pointed at the old man and said, ""ASK HIM!"" (Pretty dramatic I know, but I was very emotional.)

I went outside, loaded my son into his car seat and wept for a sold ten minutes. I thought to myself, ""Does my son need a mom who weeps when someone tries to make us feel bad for his diagnosis or does he need a mom who stands up for him to even the most ignorant of people?"" After a few minutes old man river comes out with his wife and gets into his car. As he backs out I step out of my car and wait for him to see me. When he does he sees that I've been crying my eyes out and starts to roll down his window to apologize. I pointed my arm towards the exit and said, ""Go, just go. GO!"" and I stared him down until he and his wife couldn't crane their necks any longer. I figured I made him feel bad enough. I mean, I'm not going to cuss out an old ignorant man and his wife. I'd be just as bad as they are.

I don't know how many people have to go through this kind of thing. I hope no one does. As I got back into my car a woman came outside with red eyes and tears down her face. She said she saw the whole thing and asked if she could help. I still hadn't completely calmed down but I smiled and said you can't really do anything. I didn't even know what to do. I told her I was happy that at least some people have compassion. She was so nice and told me that a friend of hers has an autistic grandson. She made sure I knew about our local events and awareness groups for families of autistic people. We hugged and I climbed into my car. 

As I drove down the street trying not to cry I realized she never told me her name. I don't know why but this sticks out in my head the most. I wish I'd gotten her email or something. People like that are too nice to just walk away from. Especially if they are active enough go on autism awareness walks with her friends.

And while there are a few weird symptoms (flapping, running in circle, pacing, or other ways of burning off inexplicable excess energy, for example), I have never had a satisfactory explanation of what exactly autism is, or even what it looks like.  How does someone get diagnosed as being autistic?  Just because they have difficulty making friends?  So if a black kid is ostracized from his purely white peer group, he magically becomes autistic, even though he was fine earlier?  Or is it because they have difficulty making friends in all peer groups, in which case I don't qualify and neither do most people diagnosed as autistic, because we've have found we can get on just fine with certain peer groups.  Is it just people who are ""weird,"" in which case isn't it basically just anti-nerd prejudice that's been institutionalized?  Are ""autistic"" and ""nerdy"" literally *synonymous*, and the doctors just don't want to admit to something so unprofessional?

None of these explanations make much sense to me, particularly considering the ultimate conclusion is that autism simply isn't a thing...But those bizarre symptoms I mentioned earlier heavily suggest that yes, it is.  Which leaves me completely mystified.  What *is* autism?

I was wondering if there are any books anyone in this subreddit could recommend.  I tried to google some stuff but wasn't sure what books / authors were reliable.  I have text books from my undergrad work, where I took courses such as organic bases of childhood communication disorders, child development, and other courses which covered the spectrum.  I might look into those textbooks too.

I started the job a few months after my supervisors usually hire, so I didn't get the training.  I just started so am currently just playing with the kids to get them to like and trust me first.  I think this is important so that when it comes time to ask them to complete tasks he or she might not resist as much as if I was a complete stranger.  My supervisor told me I will definitely have some training before I start with tasks, but I would like to know everything I can about the position so the children can benefit the most from the therapies.

Quote: 

Paradox in Tourette Kids

Against expectations, researchers have found that children with Tourette syndrome actually have greater cognitive control of their bodies than do normal children -- perhaps because of the constant struggle to suppress the condition's hallmark tics.

Stephen Jackson, PhD, and colleagues at the University of Nottingham in England had groups of children with and without Tourette syndrome manipulate symbols with one hand or the other depending on the symbol's color. Such a task requires keeping motor control firmly under the conscious brain's authority.

The Tourette children did better than the controls, the researchers reported online in Current Biology.

Moreover, functional MRI scans and neural pathway analysis showed that better performance in the Tourette group was associated with particular white matter microstructures in the prefrontal cortex.

Jackson and colleagues suggested that the findings shed light on one of the enduring mysteries of Tourette syndrome -- the disappearance or reduction of tics in many patients as they pass into adulthood.

""Children growing up with a neurological disorder may develop adaptive changes in the way that their brain is organized that will help them overcome their difficulties and gain control over their symptoms,"" said Jackson in a press release.  http://www.medpagetoday.com/LabNotes/LabNotes/25552

1476,Does anyone ever doubt their diagnosis or gone so far as to try to be undiagnosed?,"Okay, I'm 29 and was diagnosed at age 28 after seeing a therapist on my own.  I was diagnosed as ADHD as a child (and I wouldn't be surprised if that diagnosis had been Aspergers if I were born a bit later) but never really had treatment.  As a child I was teased constantly and I never really understood why.  A great deal of habits and memories make more sense in light of my Aspergers diagnosis.  HOWEVER, as an adult I think I am almost completely fine.  I can function socially pretty well and even make the decision to go out and socialize at times.  Less than other people, but still.  I am also fascinated by other people and like to hear their stories.  I like to travel and experience new things, which also strikes me as very non-autistic.  I've also always been a very good creative writer, almost on a prodigy level when I was younger.  And I'm terrible with math.  Sometimes I feel as though I have some sort of opposite autism.  FWIW, I am female, so if any female autistics are reading this I am especially interested in what you think.

However, as an adult, I recognize more sensory issues.  I can frequently feel overwhelmed in 'busy' environments and have to do things like press on my eyelids/earlobes/teeth to calm myself down.  However, I've learned to do most of these things in a socially-acceptable manner.

In short, I question my diagnosis.  I also wonder sometimes, if I was diagnosed because I went in to my therapist having done my research, and perhaps subconsciously answered the question in a way tailored to a positive diagnosis.  FWIW, I went to another psychologist later to try to be un-diagnosed but he only confirmed the diagnosis.  HOWEVER, I also doubt his methods because all he did was ask a series of questions.  He's also a therapist who works almost exclusively with Autistic/Aspergers people, so perhaps it would profit him to diagnose me.

To clarify, I'm not upset about my diagnosis, I just wonder if it's accurate.  I doubt I seem very Aspergers to most people these days.  I wonder if others are the same.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/gag4q/does_anyone_ever_doubt_their_diagnosis_or_gone_so/,975

1481,Positives and negatives to getting a diagnosis for  Aspergers,"I have a 6 year old who has been diagnosed with ADHD and is on medicine that he takes only on school days. His doctor said he feels like there might be something else going on like ODD or Aspergers. He said that unless my son is having social issues in school or it really started affecting his life he didn't want to diagnose him with anything and that there are no good therapy places that he knows of in our area.

If I could find good therapy for him within an hour drive what would be the benefits of getting him diagnosed? Does therapy work? If there's something that I can do for him now to make his life ""easier"" later I'd do it but I am having a hard time figuring out if therapy really does much good or not. I don't have any experience with it nor do I know anybody with Aspergers.

One of my biggest dilemmas with all of this is that I don't know if the things he does is part of something that needs to be diagnosed and treated or if it's just part of who he is. He is highly/profoundly gifted and is two grade levels ahead of most kids his age. I think that his brain doesn't work exactly the same as the other 6 year olds I know so I really can't compare his behavior to what they do but it's hard not to.

I just don't want the difficulties that he has now to magnify as he gets older and cause him a lot of trouble.

1482,"I don't suffer from autism, I enjoy every minute of it!","[That's the controversial T-shirt slogan my friends and I came up with.](http://enjoyautism.com)

Background: I am a high school senior at a school for students with autism. I am in the gifted/college-bound track (gifted programs within special-ed are rare, at least in the US, so I'm pretty lucky in that regard). My friends and I were complaining about some speech someone gave where they kept talking about how people 'suffer' from autism. While I do know that there are a lot of people who **do** suffer on a daily basis, the general consensus among my friends was that we, in many ways, do not suffer in not only does it give us a unique perspective on things, but thanks to early intervention we have had many opportunities (small school, therapy, integrated social skills curriculum) that the vast majority of K-12 students in the US don't get. 

So, we want to have shirts made. We're selling them right now with on-demand printing, but to lower the price and increase the quality we're having them bulk printed soon once we get enough investors.

I realize that the way we've worded the slogan will offend some people because it seems like such a blanket statement. It has been suggested to me that we change it to ""I don't suffer from **my** autism..."" but this doesn't have the same ring to it in my opinion.

Does anybody have any suggestions for a better way to phrase this sentiment before we bulk print them?

Also: We want to donate proceeds to an autism-related charity. However, I do not want it to be a cure-oriented one such as Autism Speaks. Does anybody have a suggestion of a charity/research organization that could use the funds?

1483,Some questions about iPad apps and other gadgetry for a child on the autism spectrum,"In my part of the world there is a certain amount of funding for Early Intervention services that we can access prior to a child with autism turning 7. My son is 6 and we have not used any of our funding yet, despite being approved some time ago and it is quite a substantial sum (he's been having EI, it just hasn't been paid for with this money). We never see the actual money, it is paid straight to the service provider/retailer, btw. 

Anyway, today I was told by the funding body that 35% of it can be used for equipment if it is prescribed and approved as part of his EI by a speechie, OT etc. The woman started by saying ""So, if you wanted to get an iPad..."" Well, who wouldn't? My son is quite tech-savvy and would love one but the only autism-specific apps I was aware of were for PECS, which he outgrew some time ago.

** I need to know what we'll propose to use the iPad (or any other equipment) for before starting out with a new service provider who may approve it - it has to be tied in with his goals. Have any of you had experience with apps that have been helpful?** 

My son is on the lower functioning end of the spectrum but he is quite verbal and a pretty damn smart kid. He has taught himself to read already, is good with computers and knows his way around an iPhone. He doesn't form sentences that well and would probably benefit from things like social stories.

**Also, are there any sorts of equipment or books that you'd recommend while we have this opportunity?** He needs OT as he doesn't have much of a grip on things like pencils etc (although he can write) and avoids things like putting shoes and socks on, cutting with a knife and fork etc, tending to wait until someone offers to do it for him. 

The only OT thing suggested to us was a trampoline - which would be fun but not really appropriate in terms of what he needs. He is reasonably good at recognising the main emotions although he does ask for verification - eg. asking a crying person ""Are you sad?""

**Are there any forms of EI other than speech and occupational therapy that might be worth looking into (other than ABA or anything cure/suppression oriented)? For Redditors on the spectrum, what would have been helpful to you at this age?**

From the other angle I want stories from parents of special needs, and those without who have presepectives that it is just a fact of life and how they would tell about it.

1494,"My thoughts on Autism, neurology and psychology.","Some one posted a question on R/health about not being able to feel love for others properly. This was my response and I thought it would be worth re posting for others to check out. Here it is:

Love is a philosophical term. Meaning, it describes real feeling people have in common, but it is relative to each individual. I have love for many people that I know, love for humanity at large even. but would I say I love some one on a first date? no. Simply because of the cultural implications.

Aside from that, I have been diagnosed with autism, and this unique neurology dose affect my life in varying ways. From what I understand of your description it sounds like you are not psychologically moved by others expressions of emotions at some level. This very well could be a neuro-chemical issue. If this is a case I do not support immediate pharmaceutical experimentation. Instead I will describe what has helped me being the way I am.

At the core, my trouble is social anxiety and feeling that I do not possess the kind of connections that others seem to exhibit (Easy communication, easily reading body language). My attempts to alleviate these feelings was practice, discipline, education and experimentation. I forced myself into social situations. I tried different approaches to my behavior and conduct, my perception of my personality and mannerisms and how I interacted with people. I watched many online videos and read articles about human sociology and psychology.

Through these efforts I have made critical improvements. I still suffer from some things, but these things seems to go deeper than just a unique condition and seem to be more rooted in common human psychology. Like how my job situation and living situation effects my confidence greatly, I see this is common.

Concluding, I think if you, or others, find that they suspect there is something wrong with they're mental/neurological/psychological state, they should consider they're environment and they're history of development and how these things shape who we are. But in other cases it is infarct chemical imbalances that the aid of prescriptions would help with, pharmaceuticals are dangerous and should be taken vary seriously. Also diet and exercise effect ones mental/emotional state incredibly. Hope this helps, take care and good luck.

1495,"On ""coming out"" about autism/AS","For those of you with AS, mild autism, or whatever you want to call it: How did you handle coming out, if you have?

I ask because I was first diagnosed in college, so not one person in my family knows. My roommate, a close friend from high school, and the head of HR @ work know (and that last one was only because of an emergency situation where I was having a panic attack moments before a one-on-one meeting with the CEO). Oh and I'm pretty public online, so the information is out there for anyone who knows me who really wants to dig around online (i.e. if they suspect it for some reason).

I'm sure my parents know that something is up. After all, I'm almost 25 and have never had a girlfriend. They don't even ask me about it, which might be more awkward than if they did. At the very least, they think I'm really shy. I'm worried that they think I'm hiding my life from them, i.e. that I'm gay or similar, and they just don't want to bring it up.

One of many reasons I moved across the country from my family is so that they would forget about me. I feel as though being close to my family would increase the awkwardness. This way, I only talk to them once a month or so.

I'd really like to be more open, and it's hard to maintain the dual life of being public online and keeping the secret from my family and a couple of friends.

1497,I'm having a particularly typical breakdown.,"The exhausting and laborious job that I meagerly managed to acquire earlier this summer has, once again, has slowed to the point that I've had no work all of last week and none so far this week. The unfortunate consequences of this is that, every day I face my step father who's house I currently occupy, he asks me about job related things, asks if I have any work, if I'm going to do any thing. And as a result of numerous other factors, pressures, stressors in my life I'm kinda have a rather inconvenient breakdown resulting in my not leaving my room and essentially living in perpetual terror and anxiety for the past week.

Along with those factors, my small community of friends are in perpetual poverty and turmoil. I took all of my monday to help out a couple buddies of mine who are having trouble's of their own. I drove us around, whent to walk around the woods, drove people to events they meant to be at, any way. It was very beneficial for all of us.

But the day after that, I was practically completely drained of energy. I feel it would be best to quite current job because its too impractical to commute so far, up-keep such a maintenance intensive vehicle, and takes too high a toll on my health. But quitting this job, which has no work for me and may not for months ahead, means I'll be looking for a job in a small college town in the middle of winter living at a house that is tearing me apart inside. All while trying to maintain a social life, keep up on my bills, figure out what the hell I'm gonna do.

I know I included allot of details, but all of these things I've mentioned have combined to create a climax of pressure in my life right now. I know I'll move past it one way or another. And in the long term, with any luck, I will find a situation in life that is suitable and not in perpetual threat of inequity or failure. In fact, these things have helped inspire me to plan and prepare to move out of my parents house and into... projected alternatives.

Any way, this isnt the concise and to the point article I meant to write, but it at least has helped me get some things off my back. Thanks.

Anyway, we were doing something around the house and I was letting him hold onto a key (we were playing a role-playing game, acting out a scene from a movie - long story). So, despite the fact I was trying to keep a close eye on him, he nevertheless lost the key. After trying to look for it with him, I eventually got frustrated and pointed at myself and said ""key gone - Poppa sad"". He started to cry. I picked him up and told him it was okay, told him I loved him, told him everything was going to be okay.

A little while later, he had this strange look on his face. So, I jokingly poked him on the forehead with my finger and asked him if he was okay.
He looks at me and says :

1505,"My boyfriend slightly Autistic, and I'm wondering if this is a part of it?","My boyfriend is rather touchy-feely for the average guy. He sees no problem in giving girls (and guys, but that's a 'camp' quirk of his, he's straight) hugs, having girls sit on his lap or sitting on theirs. He also is also fine with girls poking his stomach (he's rather proud of his six-pack) and will poke back.

I don't know if this is normal behaviour or how abnormal it is. I'm not worried about him cheating but I am worried about him socially. He's a lovely guy but can make enemies quite quickly. I should mention now that he is slightly Autistic. It's not actually been diagnosed and his psych report basically says that he shows definite traits from the spectrum but it's too erratic to be defined as an actual condition. He's gotten a lot better in some respects but it definitely affects his social skills these days. (It was done when he was about 9, so 9 years ago.)

1507,A couple questions for anyone who grew up with autism...,"Hey all, 

I'm currently a 20 year old college student (studying sociology) and for the past 5 summers I've worked very extensively with local programs that help kids with developmental disadvantages. One of these kids in particular has become a pretty big part of my life. I started working with him when he was about 3 years old and he's currently counting down the days until his 7th birthday.

Early on, James (named changed for the internet) was pronounced by doctors to be within the autistic spectrum. He is also non-verbal, he wears hearing aids and has low muscle tone. And he is also one of the smartest kids I have ever met. Things that he does constantly amaze me. He can read and type (writing is tough with his low muscle tone) but I work with him on his speech every time I'm with him. He knows sign language, english, and spanish. Though, he still talks mostly in concrete terms, communicating his abstract notions seems difficult for him.

I understand he sees the world differently than I do. But, since I can't ask him question like this I would like to know from any one who can answer:

**What sorts of activities appeal to you and why?** (For example, I like swimming on a hot day because it cools me down. But, perhaps, you enjoy swimming because it makes you feel weightless)

**What commonly accepted teaching methods** (in standard curriculums)**worked effectively and which didn't?**

**What commonly accepted teaching methods** (for autism and special education curriculums) **worked effectively and which didn't?**

**Do the majority of people you meet, have an accurate or inaccurate perception of your diagnosis?** (Do they understand the implications of autism? If any, which false notions recur the most often?)",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/dvgb4/a_couple_questions_for_anyone_who_grew_up_with/,996

1512,Does my friend's girlfriend have Aspergers?,"FYI: Using a throwaway as my friend is a Redditor as well. Sorry this is so long.

I just moved in with my friend and his girlfriend. I've always known she was a bit different, and it never bothered me. Since moving in together however, it's become a huge issue. They've been dating for nearly 4 years, and have had their share of issues, he's cheated on her a few times, they broke up once and she developed an eating disorder from it, etc. They're back together now, and just lived by themselves in their own apartment for a year. She pretty much had him all to her self, and controlled every aspect of his life, and I mean EVERY aspect. She even moved him away from any of his friends, including me. He pretty much spent the entire year playing WoW which she would play with him, but overall he was pretty miserable.

He finally quit WoW, and started hanging out with me in person again. His lease was up and so was mine so we decided we should move in together, the three of us.

Well little did I know, she is extremely possessive of him, and requires his attention 90% of the time. She uses a series of unusual behaviors to get his attention, yet then when he does pay attention to her if it's not in exactly the way she wants him to pay attention to her she gets upset with him and throws fits much like a child.

She has a routine, and a plan for everything, and makes him do everything with her. I feel like without him around she is not capable of taking care of herself, without him she gets so stressed out and overwhelmed with simply tasks she just kind of shuts down into a depression, and does nothing. She wasn't working when we first moved in and would sit around all day doing nothing, but the second he would get home from work she would make him do chores with her, and in her way, or she gets upset and pouts, cries, or gets overwhelmed and leaves abruptly for no reason if he doesn't do things exactly the way she wants him to in the order she wants to do them.

She takes everything literally, and I mean everything. Anything I say she completely misinterprets, and then runs to her boyfriend and tells him I said things I never said. She's afraid of confrontation, so she never tells me anything important like, ""Hey the dishes are clean, do you mind putting them away this time?"" Instead she uses her boyfriend as a filter to try and communicate with me, which does not work because he doesn't care, and never passes the message to me. I suppose he's use to hearing this kind of thing from her.

The only times she talks to me she rants about unusual topics, but doesn't make eye contact, or notice I really don't care about whatever she's talking about. It's not that I'm trying to be rude, she just talks about nothing of substance, it's either random bits of information, or unusual stories that sound fabricated.

She's told me she cannot understand metaphor, and doesn't enjoy reading fiction, or watching comedy movies. She doesn't like watching TV because she has a hard time understanding it, the few shows she does watch are the ones that are horribly written with horrible actors. Her favorite actors are one's who don't display emotion. She particularly does not understand comedy. Her idea of a joke is threatening to break up with her boyfriend on a nearly daily basis - she does it in an unusual way but it just comes out wrong and isn't funny (something that makes me uncomfortable having to hear every day).

She excels are certain things (puzzles, math, she likes to read but only certain things), but socially seems awkward, and immature. She has maybe one or two good friends but thats it.

She takes everything personal. For example, I had never cleaned the oven (something I guess is part of one her cleaning routines?), so she stopped cleaning the oven assuming I would notice, and then clean the oven. The thing is she never told me clean the oven, I don't think I've ever cleaned an oven, as I never really make anything that causes an oven to become that dirty. To her, she saw me leaving the oven dirty as a personal attack against her. I also have two little wiener dogs, one day she came home and put all of their toys in a basket too tall for them get the toys out of. So they sat there barking at the basket for an hour. So I took the toys out of the basket for them, she took this again as a personal attack against her, which in reality the basket idea didn't work, and it had nothing to do with her personally.

There's plenty more stories, and we all recently got in a huge fight that was blown completely out of proportion for something significantly minor because she misinterpreted something I had said. She had a laundry list of things she was personally insulted over, including me not cleaning the oven, despite the fact she never told me or her boyfriend that the oven required cleaning. The whole time myself and her boyfriend were trying to explain why it's not logical to assume I should have known to clean the oven because she stopped cleaning it, and that it was not an appropriate manor of communication. Yet she insisted it was appropriate communication, and I just should have known. We had to go through a list of like 10 things she had taken issue with, all of which were minor, yet she knew the exact dates, and number of times I had supposedly done certain tasks like taking out the garbage, or ran the dish washer.

It hit me in the middle of the argument, she has Aspergers. I've read about it before because I briefly dated a girl who had Aspergers, and I'm surprised I didn't realize it sooner. I seriously was wondering why my friend would date a girl who was coming off as a control-freak sociopath, but I now realize she isn't a sociopath, she's just different. Anyhow, I wanted to get some people's feedback who know about this or who have Asperger syndrome. I apologize if anything I say comes off the wrong way.

1515,Social Relationships: Erotic Irony,"I thought many with social problems of too much honesty could relate to this discussion from [Joseph Campbell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell) in The Power of Myth:

------------

Joseph Campbell: Novels -- great novels -- can be wonderfully instructive. In my twenties and thirties and even on into my forties, James Joyce and Thomas Mann were my teachers. I read everything they wrote. Both were writing in terms of what might be called the mythological traditions. Take, for example, the story of Tonio, in Thomas Mann's Tonio Kroger. Tonio's father was a substantial businessman, a major citizen in his hometown. Little Tonio, however, had an artistic temperament, so he moved to Munich and joined a group of literary people who felt themselves above the mere money earners and family men.

So here is Tonio between two poles: his father, who was a good father, responsible and all of that, but who never did the thing he wanted to in all his life -- and, on the other hand, the one who leaves his hometown and becomes a critic of that kind of life. But Tonio found that he really loved these hometown people. And although he thought himself a little superior in an intellectual way to them and could describe them with cutting words, his heart was nevertheless with them.

But when he left to live with the bohemians, he found that they were so disdainful of life that he couldn't stay with them, either. So he left them, and wrote a letter back to someone in the group, saying, ""I admire those cold, proud beings who adventure upon the paths of great and daemonic beauty and despise 'mankind'; but I do not envy them. For if anything is capable of making a poet of a literary man, it is my hometown love of the human, the living and ordinary. All warmth derives from this love, all kindness and all humor. Indeed, to me it even seems that this must be that love of which it is written that one may 'speak with the tongues of men and of angels,' and yet, lacking love, be 'as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.' ""

And then he says, **""The writer must be true to truth."" And that's a killer, because the only way you can describe a human being truly is by describing his imperfections. The perfect human being is uninteresting -- the Buddha who leaves the world, you know. It is the imperfections of life that are lovable. And when the writer sends a dart of the true word, it hurts. But it goes with love. This is what Mann called ""erotic irony,"" the love for that which you are killing with your cruel, analytical word.**

Bill MOYERS: I cherish that image: my hometown love, the feeling you get for that place, no matter how long you've been away or even if you never return. That was where you first discovered people. But why do you say you love people for their imperfections? .

Joseph CAMPBELL: Aren't children lovable because they're falling down all the time and have little bodies with the heads too big? Didn't Walt Disney know all about this when he did the seven dwarfs? And these funny little dogs that people have -- they're lovable because they're so imperfect.

Bill MOYERS: Perfection would be a bore, wouldn't it?

Joseph CAMPBELL: It would have to be. It would be inhuman. The umbilical point, the humanity, the thing that makes you human and not supernatural and immortal -- that's what's lovable. That is why some people have a very hard time loving God, because there's no imperfection there. You can be in awe, but that would not be real love.

1516,"I'm working on a ""conversation program"" and am wondering if this could help anyone?","Hi, for unrelated reasons I'm working on a program that can sort of mimic conversation-- video clips are shown, and if you have a question in response you can click that button and a new video is shown in response to that one. 

So it could be used to demonstrate a simple conversation, where the questions that you can ask are things like ""what's your name?"" and ""how are you today?"" and the clip shown would be responses like ""I'm great, how about you,"" etc.  So a small-talk walkthrough.

I was thinking this might be useful for children who have trouble with socializing, because they could see the person's face respond in the video to what they're saying, and try different things to say.  But I don't know much about this.  Can anyone tell me if this would be helpful?  If so I'll try to make a free website out of it when I'm done and try to get people to contribute content.

1519,How does one go about getting tested for Autistic Spectrum Disorders as an adult? (xpost from AskReddit),"(Posted originally at AskReddit, but unless your topic is risque or asinine it tends not to stay long enough apparently, but you all may have a better idea anyway).

Long story short, I have autistic traits (likely not Asperger's, but I fit enough criteria for a potential PDD-NOS diagnosis [the most common diagnosis on the spectrum, by the way]) and I experience enough distress that I feel it would be best if I got tested/screened by a professional, which would help dictate a choice in action. I've already diagnoses for anxiety and mood disorders, but many of the symptoms I possess have been on-going since childhood, and still more or less affect me negatively. Not self-diagnosing (if anything, I would have chosen something else), hence the desire to see a professional.

Anyway the point is, how does one go about it? I know I'll likely have to talk to my general physician, then it's up to the HMO in all likelihood, but I'd like to at least not be mindless when bringing it up, or to at least streamline the process if at all possible. (By that I mean, I don't want to see a social worker just to get an OK to see a psychiatrist/psychologist, that would be little than a waste of time, which I had to do to see my first psychiatrist (second one was via my university when I was a student, which is my most up-to-date on that front)).

If anything, I'd like to know the diagnostic process involved.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/mrjw9/how_does_one_go_about_getting_tested_for_autistic/,1003
1520,"Hey /r/autism, long-time Redditor and wife launched a web app for creating visual supports -- want to help us test it?","Hello there! I'm a long-time redditor, and I build websites and web applications. My wife is a Speech Therapist, working at a school for children with autism and multiple disabilities. We decided to team up and create a web application for parents and professionals who work with children (and adults!) with ASD, called Symbly.

You can read more about it here: http://www.symbly.us

In a nutshell, you can use it to create all kinds of visual supports: visual schedules, communication boards, social stories, etc. It features a quick and easy interface, image searching (including access to the full SymbolStix symbol library), and sharing. 

There's also a companion iPad app that lets you sync the supports you create wirelessly, and then take them with you on the go (even if you don't have Internet access wherever you're going). 

We're working on getting all the bugs worked out, and need folks willing to beta test it and help us (and use it for free!)

If you use (or know someone who uses) visual supports, this may be something that can make your life a little easier. If you're interested, you can send me a message here on Reddit, or via email directly: riley@symbly.us

1521,Daughter diagnosed with Autism at 27 months. Help?,"Izzy is a sweet little girl who just doesn't talk very much. She has about 5 words. Sometimes she learns new ones, but then loses them again. She has a flat affect, we've been told, but we're not sure we agree. She's shy around strangers, but happy and affectionate with her family. She smiles, she laughs, and she gives hugs and kisses. She points things out and looks where we point. She understands everything we tell her to do, but has trouble expressing what she needs or wants.

She's been evaluated four times. The first two times she was found in normal ranges even though we thought she was speech delayed. The second two times, she was diagnosed with Autism.

Now we're being told she qualifies for services. When we tried to just make appointments with speech pathologists before now, we were asked if she had been evaluated for Autism, as if it was some sort of passport to deserving care. We were told that without an Autism diagnosis, the wait list is a year or more for any sort of speech, physical, or occupational therapy. What the fuck?

Anyway, now we've got an Autism diagnosis for Izzy. The subcontractors sent out by the state told us that they will offer her therapy using ABA which hs Analyzed Behavior something something.... I think?

I asked whether we were obligated to use them or whether there was a choice and they got offended and left their card but didn't schedule a consultation to determine which specific services Izzy needs as they initially said they would. They implied that there would now be a significant delay in treating Izzy because of my indecision over whether to use them.

What other methodologies than ABA are out there? We really think she only needs speech therapy. We think she may be apraxic because she has feeding/swallowing difficulty as well as speech problems. But the evaluators pointed out all sorts of behaviors and facial expressions that were ""wrong"".

We feel sort of adrift here. Any insight or advice would be appreciated. We feel as though we're already behind schedule on getting Izzy some intervention at least for her speech and it seems as though the programs in our state are eager to stretch those delays even longer, ESPECIALLY if we dare to question them or don't say the proper code words in every interaction.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/mgv7i/daughter_diagnosed_with_autism_at_27_months_help/,583

1524,Should I give up my writing goals? (Asperger's. Wall of text.),"I've been aware that I have Asperger's for about eight years now, finding out in a sunny autumn day in high school. It took me a while to cope with the fact that the real diagnosis was kept from me for ages, but once I came to terms with it, It helps explain some things about my personal history. It also motivated me to begin my journey of overcoming the disorder. 

I'm too stubborn and Texan to be restrained by fate and by God or whatever force is out there in the universe, so if I have a chance to rattle my chains and scream against the hand dealt to me, I will do it. 

It occurs to me that I'm still not very good with social situations, and writing requires dialogue and discussion, so now I find myself on a precipice of a decision, I think. I've been writing since before I knew I had Asperger's, and since then, but ever since a recent family tragedy in May I've been questioning my drive.

There's not much of a creative spark going on, and the trouble of writing dialogue has always been there, but now I don't know if I should take a hiatus to focus on other things I desperately need to remedy in my life or to toss this creative phase behind me.

Your advice will be appreciated.

I currently work as a part-time support worker for The Wessex Autistic Society as well as studying for my degree and my future aim is to link the two together.

I would really like to hear your views on the subject, and if anybody has had previous experience with animal or equine assisted therapy, I would be interested to hear from you.

If anyone would be willing to help me in my research by completing a questionnaire or would like any additional information, then please contact me.

1528,36 month old only partially showing signs of autism and we are confused.  Help!,"Hi everyone.  I just found this sub-Reddit after realizing that this could be the first in a long series of steps that my hubby and I take into educating ourselves on the autism spectrum and all the myriad (overwhelming!) things that go with it.

Anyway, we started the process of going through referrals and looking into Early Intervention services about a month ago.  It will take almost another month before they finish doing their evaluations and such, and so it puts us in a sort of limbo.

Obviously I am no way attempting to make a proper diagnosis myself, but the process has left me desiring information and guidance.  We've spent the last few months going back and forth on the ""does-he-or-doesn't-he"" and keep feeling so confused.  At home he seems so normal...I wouldn't even realize there was a ""problem"" unless someone else pointed something out.  I guess I just don't overthink it or have expectations of how else he should be.  And when we did the MCHAT and the ASQ, there were sooo many things that I felt like ""proved"" (at least to me) that autism couldn't be the problem (particularly, I can't pinpoint anything in the restricted/repetitive behavior problems at all). As far as I understand it, this would make him fail the DSM-IV diagnosis for autism.  But...clearly he DOES have developmental concerns.  *So what do you do with something that only ""sort of"" looks like autism?*


Some background:  we have a 36 month old son who is an only child, and he currently doesn't really have any ""friends"" from our social group, as we were the first to have a child (although a few friends now have newborns/are pregnant).  He has been in daycare since he was 12 months old, anywhere from 2-4 days per week.  I am a full-time student/SAHM, and his father works full-time and is a part-time student as well.

Beings that we have always had a very informal (neither of us can stand ""helicopter parents"") approach to parenting and child development, we spent the last year going through the hard transition of ""oh, he's just a tiny bit delayed in his speech...he'll probably just start talking when he turns 3"" to ""I think we may have a problem"" to OTHER people saying ""I think he may have a problem.""  Suffice to say, it has not been an easy transition, and it has felt very isolating at times.  

His first area of concern is a language/speech delay (he only says maybe 2 dozen words consistently; a good chunk of his words/phrases are hard to understand, and he stopped saying words after successfully saying them for a short while...red flag, we know).  He does not call me mommy unless asked to repeat it (which also is hit-and-miss), but clearly knows who ""mommy"" is (he'll get excited if I'm not home and say ""mommy"" over and over if his dad asks something like ""do you want to go pick up mommy?"").  Same thing with ""daddy"".

His other area, which took longer to observe/understand is a social issue.  As he doesn't really have other kids to hang out with at home (since I never felt comfortable with play groups and none of our friends have kids), this was really hard to observe.  When he's at daycare obviously we aren't there, but over time his teachers have reported that he generally plays alone, and at times can be overly aggressive (especially to smaller kids).  This was also hard to gauge because 1) preferring solo play seemed like it could be a personality thing and 2) being aggressive is often tied into language/communication frustrations.  The other social issues are that he does tend to avoid (about half the time) eye contact, he infrequently responds to his own name, he doesn't always use ""proper"" gestures (he prefers to use an open hand rather than pointing), and he doesn't do much ""pretend play"" other than with cars (moving them, making car noises).  

And since the third component of autism (at least as the medical community is concerned) is repetitive/restricted behavior, here's where it gets confusing.  He has NONE of theses issues.  We don't keep a set schedule at all.  He transitions from activity to activity with relative ease.  His life has a lot of inconsistency in it, and it really doesn't seem to phase him.  The only thing that remotely might be an ""issue"" is that he's a picky eater.  I have a hard time buying this a problem, because I really don't think he's all that different than any other kid his age.  He prefers the obvious foods; pizza, spaghetti, chicken nuggets, ice cream, etc..  Every question in that section in both the MCHAT and the ASQ and the ASQ-S/E came back with nothing.


Anyway, I know in the long run he is going to get help, but I am just having such a hard time making sense of this.  I keep going back and forth as to whether it's even really a problem (""autism is overdiagnosed!!!!1one"") or a life lesson (""this is what it means to be a good parent"").

Any suggestions, guidance, information, words of wisdom, etc would be very much appreciated.  I guess mostly I'm hoping to start off on the right path and this is a place to do it.",http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/lwwfy/36_month_old_only_partially_showing_signs_of/,1007
